You are presented with a problem and a previous memory.

You have access to tools that can help you solve the problem. Use them if necessary. In particular, if you can't find the answer in the memory, you should use the **memory_list**, **memory_key_retrieve**, **memory_embedding_retrieve** and **memory_bm25_retrieve** tools to find relevant information. If you can not find the answer using one of these tools, you can also use other tools to help you. Try as hard as you can to find the answer using the tools available to you until you find the answer or you are sure that the answer is not in the memory or tools. Do not decide that the answer is not in the memory or tools unless you have used all relevant tools to search for the answer. Before you decided that the information is not available, check that you have used all relevant tools to search for the answer.

Please answer the problem based on the previous memory and the tools. Put your final answer in \\boxed{{}}.
