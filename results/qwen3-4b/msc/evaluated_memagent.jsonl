You’ve embraced plant-based meals, enjoy lemon-flavored hummus, and are open to trying vegan cheese and new flavors, even if it's a small step.  \n\nYou’re also embracing adventure—like skydiving, which you see as a life-changing, thrilling challenge, and you’ve already booked it through a Groupon deal. You’re inspired by roller coasters, especially in Heide Park, Germany, and even humorously dream of visiting ones in Greenland. These experiences reflect your desire to balance stability with excitement.  \n\nOn a deeper level, time has transformed your connection to art. You used to be a professional painter, selling pieces for over $5,000, and now painting is a therapeutic outlet—especially your latest piece, a futuristic interpretation of the \"Big Bang.\" You see art as a form of healing and self-discovery.  \n\nYou also shared a deep emotional bond with another person who is creating abstract art inspired by the collision of ocean and sky—a metaphor for emotional dynamics. Though they don’t want to sell their art, they’re open to painting for passion and connection.  \n\nUltimately, your aspirations aren’t just about career or money—they’re about living a balanced, meaningful life. You’re growing through challenges, embracing new experiences, and cherishing shared moments with friends, music, food, and art. Time hasn’t just changed your path—it’s helped you find purpose, healing, and joy in the everyday.  \n\nSo yes, I remember.

I got started by rescuing around 20,000 bees from a nearby farm, where I found the queen bee and allowed the worker bees to locate her. I now occasionally perform bee rescues for people whose properties have unexpected bee nesting, especially in rural areas. When relocating hives, I use a non-lethal freezing compound to help keep the bees in place during transport. Some bees are inevitably left behind, but they often attempt to rebuild a hive in the same vicinity—bees are territorial and can sustain themselves temporarily without a queen, though they cannot produce new bees indefinitely. The original hive's bees can be collected and reunited with their colony later. I also enjoy the fascinating work of beekeeping and have learned that bees are incredibly resilient and hardworking. I am married to a woman from Italy who is a model, and she inspired me to start eating papaya, which has become my favorite food. I welcome visitors to my bee farm, including bringing dogs—my wife’s dog, Peaches, is a two-year-old pug that I’ve known since she was a puppy.

I enjoy the idea of driving through nature, especially mountains, and have been inspired by the outdoor lifestyle of others—like a teacher who owns a golden retriever named Sally and loves taking her on walks and trips.

I’ve considered learning the cello in the future, drawn to its deep, mournful sound, and I think I could pick it up given my experience with violin and guitar.\n\nI also love comedy—particularly Stephen Colbert, George Carlin, and Mark Gungor—and enjoy clean, family-friendly humor like *Dry Bar* on YouTube. I teach my nephew to play the guitar, though he often prefers watching Blippi on YouTube. I’ve also taught him to speak Chinese, which he now uses alongside English. I love spending time with him, playing in the yard, and exploring big cities—especially New York City, where I’ve used my Chinese skills in Chinatown, even if it takes a bit of getting back into rhythm.\n\nI’m comfortable with my child-free lifestyle and see it as a meaningful choice. I enjoy being a cool aunt, teaching young people, and bonding without the responsibilities of parenting. I have no pets and value a solo life centered around music, travel, and meaningful conversations. I also enjoy playing board games with my stepkids, though I find games like Risk too complex for children.
