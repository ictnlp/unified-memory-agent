I was beautiful, popular, and financially stable. But now, at 56, I spend my days cleaning and reflecting on my past, often painting as a form of therapy. I’ve always loved creating art inspired by outer space, especially my interpretation of the \"Big Bang,\" which has been a source of comfort and healing.\n\nHowever, I’ve decided to shift direction. I’m no longer going to paint space—though it was meaningful—it’s time for something unexpected and surprising. Inspired by Andy Warhol’s ability to transform the ordinary into something powerful and commercially successful, I’m aiming to create a piece that will shock, resonate, and be sold globally—*everywhere*. My dream is for all my art to be seen and purchased in every corner of the world.\n\nTo make this happen, I’m reaching out to friends in Portugal and London who have strong art connections. I’ve also been inspired to visit the Andy Warhol Museum, where they’re currently hiring—this could be the perfect opportunity to launch my career and gain international exposure. I believe that by blending my personal struggles with bold, unconventional themes, I can create art that speaks to people deeply and reaches audiences far beyond my current reach. Art has always been my lifeline, and I’m determined to bring it back to the world—on a global scale.", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.06870229007633587, "exact_match": 0.0, "f1_custom": 0.06870229007633587, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.06451612903225808, "llm_score": 1}, "evaluation_time": 6.970161199569702, "generation_time": 21.645534992218018}
