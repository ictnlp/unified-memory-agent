Here’s a healthy, customizable, and delicious homemade coffee creamer recipe inspired by the principles from your breakfast-focused memory—perfect for enhancing your coffee with flavor, nutrition, and personalization:\n\n---\n\n### 🌿 **Vanilla Hazelnut Creamer (Homemade & Low-Sugar)**\n\n**Base Ingredients (serves 4–6):**  \n- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or oat, cashew, or coconut milk for different textures)  \n- 2 tablespoons ground hazelnuts (or 1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts for a crunchy texture)  \n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  \n- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  \n- A pinch of sea salt (to balance sweetness and enhance flavor)  \n- 1–2 teaspoons of a natural sweetener (optional): stevia, monk fruit, yacon syrup, or maple syrup (adjust to taste)\n\n**Optional Nutritional Boosts:**  \n- 1 scoop unflavored or vanilla protein powder (e.g., pea, rice, or collagen)  \n- 1 teaspoon MCT oil or coconut oil (for a creamy, rich texture and healthy fats)  \n- 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder (for a chocolate-hazelnut twist—great with a splash of dark chocolate chips)\n\n---\n\n### 🍂 How to Make It:\n1. **Blend the base:** In a blender or food processor, combine the milk, hazelnut powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Blend until smooth and creamy.  \n2. **Add sweetener:** Add your preferred natural sweetener and blend again until fully incorporated.  \n3. **Boost nutrition (optional):** Add protein powder and MCT oil, then blend until smooth.  \n4. **For a chocolate twist:** Stir in 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder and a few dark chocolate chips (melted slightly) for a decadent cocoa-hazelnut flavor.  \n5. **Store:** Pour into a reusable, airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 1 week. Shake before use for best texture.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why This Works:\n- **Flavor profile:** Rich, nutty, and aromatic—like a gourmet coffee creamer without the sugar or dairy.  \n- **Healthier than store-bought:** No trans fats, artificial flavors, or excessive sugar.  \n- **Customizable:** Adjust sweetness, spice, or add-ins to match your taste.  \n- **Nutrient-dense:** Adds protein, healthy fats, and fiber—just like a balanced breakfast.  \n- **Sustainable:** Uses reusable containers and plant-based ingredients.\n\n---\n\n💡 **Pro Tip:** Try rotating flavors—like **Cocoa Crunch** (cocoa + sea salt + a pinch of nutmeg) or **Coconut Vanilla** (coconut milk + vanilla + a touch of cardamom). Always test small batches first to find your perfect balance!\n\nRemember: *Breakfast is about balance and personalization—so your coffee creamer should be too.* Experiment, adjust, and enjoy your new favorite morning ritual! ☕✨\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you'd like a non-dairy, vegan, or low-carb version!", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.09324009324009325, "exact_match": 0.0, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.06928406466512702, "llm_score": 1}, "evaluation_time": 5.844655275344849, "generation_time": 427.8828797340393}

Any advice on getting better results?", "expected_answer": "The user would prefer responses that provide tips and advice specifically tailored to their slow cooker experiences, utilizing their recent success with beef stew and interest in making yogurt in the slow cooker. They might not prefer general slow cooker recipes or advice unrelated to their specific experiences and interests.", "response": "To improve your slow cooker recipes and achieve better results, focus on a combination of temperature control, ingredient selection, flavor balancing, and texture management—especially when working with fermented or plant-based dishes like yogurt or stews.\n\nHere’s a practical, science-backed guide tailored to your needs:\n\n### 1. **Master Temperature Control**\n- **For fermentation (e.g., yogurt):** Use a **low heat setting** (on the slow cooker) to maintain a consistent temperature between **110°F–120°F** for 8–12 hours. This range promotes safe and effective fermentation without scorching or overcooking.\n- **For heating (e.g., stews or sauces):** Keep the temperature between **180°F–185°F** to gently cook ingredients without breaking down delicate textures or nutrients.\n\n> 🔍 *Tip:* Use a kitchen thermometer to monitor temperature—this ensures consistency and prevents common issues like curdling or undercooking.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Choose the Right Base for Your Recipe**\nExperiment with different plant-based bases for richer, more balanced results:\n- **Cashew-based yogurt** (ideal for creamy, tangy bases)\n- **Soy, coconut, almond, oat, rice, hemp, or flax yogurt** (each offers unique flavor and texture profiles)\n\n#### 🥛 **Step-by-Step Cashew-Based Slow Cooker Yogurt (Beginner-Friendly)**\n1. **Soak:** Rinse 1 cup raw cashews. Soak in fresh water for **at least 4 hours or overnight**. Drain and rinse again.\n2. **Blend:** Add 1/2 cup fresh water to a high-speed blender. Blend on high for **2 minutes**, stopping to scrape sides. The mixture should be smooth and creamy.\n3. **Strain:**  \n   - Use a **cheesecloth, nut milk bag, or fine-mesh sieve**.  \n   - For best results, **squeeze gently but firmly** to extract as much liquid as possible.  \n   - *Cheesecloth or nut milk bag* gives the smoothest texture—ideal for beginners.  \n4. **Adjust consistency:**  \n   - Thicker yogurt: use a **1:0.75 cashew-to-water ratio** (e.g., 1 cup cashews + 0.75 cups water).  \n   - Thinner yogurt: use **1:1.25** (e.g., 1 cup cashews + 1.25 cups water).  \n5. **Ferment:**  \n   - Add a **vegan yogurt starter or probiotic powder**.  \n   - Incubate at 110°F–120°F for **8–12 hours** (or overnight).  \n6. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least **2 hours** to set and develop tanginess.\n\n> ✅ *Bonus:* Add flavorings like vanilla, cinnamon, maple syrup, or cocoa powder. For texture, mix in chia seeds, flaxseeds, granola, or chopped nuts.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Enhance Flavor & Nutrition with Smart Add-Ins**\n- **Sweeteners (low-glycemic):** Honey, maple syrup, coconut sugar, date syrup, monk fruit, or stevia.\n- **Spices & Aromatics:** Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, lemon zest, cardamom, turmeric.\n- **Texture Boosters:** Chopped nuts, seeds, dried fruit (raisins, cranberries), cocoa nibs.\n\n> 🌍 *Global Inspiration:* Try Indian-inspired spice blends (cumin, coriander, garam masala) in lentil curries or Mediterranean-style herbs (oregano, thyme) in roasted vegetable stews.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Try These Versatile Vegan & Vegetarian Slow Cooker Recipes**\n- **Lentil Curry** – rich, protein-packed, with turmeric and cumin  \n- **Roasted Vegetable Stew** – seasonal veggies with garlic, rosemary, and thyme  \n- **Black Bean Chili** – hearty, customizable with beans, tomatoes, and chili powder  \n- **Chickpea Curry** – creamy, tangy, with coconut milk and curry spices  \n- **Vegan Mac & Cheese** – made with cashew cream and nutritional yeast  \n- **Eggplant Parmesan** – slow-cooked with tomato sauce and vegan cheese  \n- **Butternut Squash Risotto** – creamy, sweet, and comforting  \n\n> 💡 *Pro Tip:* Combine ingredients thoughtfully—e.g., blend slow cooker yogurt into a stew for a creamy, probiotic-rich finish.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Best Practices for Success**\n- Always **sanitize your tools** (blender, strainer, slow cooker) to avoid contamination.\n- **Start with simple recipes** and gradually experiment with complex flavor combinations", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.08650519031141868, "exact_match": 0.0, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.058419243986254296, "llm_score": 1}, "evaluation_time": 5.8365302085876465, "generation_time": 2104.361465215683}

Given the presence of a shedding cat—implied in the environmental context—common allergens like pet dander, dust, and airborne particles are likely triggers. These can irritate your nasal passages and cause sneezing, especially if the living room has poor air quality or high levels of clutter.\n\nTo address this, consider the following actionable steps:\n\n### 1. **Reduce Allergens**\n- Use a **vacuum with a HEPA filter** (e.g., Dyson Ball Animal 2, Shark Navigator Lift-Away) to trap 99.97% of dust and dander.\n- Dust surfaces with a **damp microfiber cloth** to prevent dust from becoming airborne.\n- **Groom your cat regularly** to reduce shedding.\n- Wash **cat bedding and toys** frequently to remove accumulated dander.\n- Maintain **low humidity** (ideally 30–50%) with a dehumidifier to reduce dust mites.\n\n### 2. **Improve Air Quality with Plants**\nCertain indoor plants can help purify the air by removing common pollutants like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene—substances that may be present in furnishings or cleaning products. Recommended plants include:\n- **Spider Plant** – Easy to care for, removes formaldehyde and xylene\n- **Snake Plant** – Low maintenance, removes formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene\n- **Pothos** – Removes formaldehyde and toluene, adaptable to low light\n- **Rubber Plant** – Removes formaldehyde and benzene, prefers bright indirect light\n- **Aloe Vera** – Medicinal and air-purifying, removes formaldehyde and benzene\n- **Bamboo Palm** – Removes trichloroethylene and formaldehyde\n\n✅ **Plant Tips**:\n- Use **planters with drainage holes** (terracotta, unglazed clay, or ceramic) to prevent overwatering.\n- Add a **drainage saucer** or layer of perlite/vermiculite for extra safety.\n- Water sparingly—especially in winter. Fertilize once per month during spring/summer at half strength using a balanced 20-20-20 fertilizer.\n\n### 3. **Environmental Adjustments**\n- Reduce clutter in the living room to minimize dust accumulation.\n- Mop hard floors regularly.\n- Limit your cat’s access to high-traffic areas like the living room or bedroom.\n- Consider using **dust-repelling fabrics** (e.g., microfiber, Crypton) on furniture and curtains.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can significantly improve indoor air quality and reduce your exposure to allergens—potentially alleviating your sneezing. If symptoms persist, consult a healthcare provider to rule out other causes like allergies, asthma, or viral infections.\n\nIn short: **Yes, your living room is likely a contributing factor—especially due to pet dander and dust.

Similarly, a high school reunion offers a rare opportunity to reconnect with people who shaped your formative years, to reflect on personal growth, and to rekindle genuine human connections. This mirrors the mindfulness and presence you’ve cultivated through practices like gratitude journaling, digital detoxes, and mindful eating—practices that emphasize savoring the present and honoring the past with compassion.\n\nMoreover, your commitment to self-awareness, emotional well-being, and intentional living makes this a thoughtful, value-driven decision. The reunion isn’t just about reliving the past; it’s about engaging with it in a way that fosters reflection, joy, and authentic connection—exactly the kind of experience you’ve chosen to prioritize in your life.\n\nWith your critical mindset and awareness of digital distractions, you’re also well-equipped to approach the reunion mindfully: setting boundaries, focusing on meaningful interactions, and honoring diverse perspectives. Just as you’ve learned Spanish through cooking with your abuela—through sensory, relational, and experiential touchpoints—your reunion could become a meaningful reconnection through shared stories, laughter, and presence.\n\nIn short, attending the reunion is not just a nostalgic choice—it’s a natural extension of your intentional, grounded, and human-centered lifestyle. It’s a chance to savor real moments, honor your roots, and celebrate the people who helped shape who you are today.  \n\nSo yes—go ahead. It could be one of the most meaningful, joyful, and healing experiences of your year. 🎉", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.17270194986072426, "exact_match": 0.0, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.10133333333333333, "llm_score": 0}, "evaluation_time": 6.044916868209839, "generation_time": 2194.3692948818207}

Since you've been feeling stuck with your paintings, here’s a fresh, personalized source of inspiration—drawn directly from your own passions and habits—because **your creativity is already rich with structure, story, and meaning**.\n\n👉 **Painting as a form of curation and storytelling**  \nYou’ve spent years curating your collectibles—organizing them by theme, telling stories through character arcs (like Miles Morales’ journey in the Spider-Verse), and building a display that feels emotionally and visually complete. That same energy can be applied to your paintings.\n\n### 🎨 Actionable Inspiration Ideas:\n1. **Create a \"Spider-Verse Painting Series\"**  \n   - Paint key moments from Miles Morales’ story: his first encounter with Spider-Man, his battle with the Green Goblin, or his rise as a hero.  \n   - Use the visual language of your comics—dynamic angles, vibrant colors, and emotional tension—to translate the narrative into paint.  \n   - This gives your work a clear arc, like your completed Spider-Verse collection.\n\n2. **Design a Themed Painting Collection**  \n   - Just as you have \"Spider-Man in Different Eras\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" themes, try creating a series like:  \n     - *The Rise of the Web-Slinger*  \n     - *Urban Heroes: Night Shift*  \n     - *The First Spider: A Legacy*  \n   - Each painting can be a chapter in a visual story, just like your collection.\n\n3. **Apply Curatorial Principles to Composition**  \n   - Use the same balance and structure you use in your display case:  \n     - A **central focal point** (e.g., Miles Morales in the center of the frame)  \n     - **Surrounding elements** (background cityscapes, shadows, or other characters)  \n     - **Thematic grouping** (e.g., all paintings in a series share a color palette or lighting style)  \n   - This creates paintings that feel intentional, meaningful, and emotionally resonant.\n\n4. **Add Texture to Bring Depth**  \n   - You’ve shown interest in texture—especially with palette knives. Use this to bring physical presence to your work:  \n     - Try **impasto strokes** to mimic the roughness of city walls, fabric, or leaves.  \n     - Use **scraping and smoothing** to create skin, bark, or fabric textures.  \n   - This makes your paintings not just seen, but *felt*—just like your collectibles have a tactile presence.\n\n5. **Track Your Progress Like You Track Your Collection**  \n   - Start a **personal art journal** (like your comic catalog) where you:  \n     - Note each painting’s theme, inspiration, and emotional significance  \n     - Assign a \"value\" to each piece—not monetary, but emotional or narrative (e.g., \"This painting represents my first step in trusting my own voice\")  \n     - Use apps like **Comic Connect**, **Sortly**, or **Collectionaire** to organize your painting projects and track themes over time  \n\n6. **Display Your Paintings with Intention**  \n   - Just as you proudly display your Spider-Verse comics, hang your paintings in a curated way—grouped by theme, with a central piece and surrounding elements.  \n   - This transforms your art from a solitary activity into a **personal narrative space**—a place where you can reflect, celebrate, and grow.\n\n---\n\n💡 **Final Thought:**  \nYou don’t need to find “new” inspiration from outside sources. You already have a deep well of storytelling, structure, and emotional investment—just like your collectibles.  \n**Your paintings can be the next chapter in your personal story.**  \n\nStart small: pick one theme from your collection (e.g., Miles Morales), sketch a scene, and paint it with texture and intention.  \nThen, celebrate it—not because it’s perfect, but because it’s *yours*.\n\nYou’ve got this. And the best part? You’re already doing it. 🎨✨", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.07744107744107745, "exact_match": 0.0, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.05237315875613748, "llm_score": 1}, "evaluation_time": 2.8754403591156006, "generation_time": 2438.943808078766}

They might not prefer generic cookie-making advice or suggestions that don't take into account their existing use of turbinado sugar.", "response": "To enhance the flavor of your chocolate chip cookies, try these practical and actionable suggestions from the memory:\n\n1. **Add Warm Spices** – Incorporate a small amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, or ginger (e.g., 1/2 tsp cinnamon) for a rich, aromatic depth that complements chocolate and enhances chewiness. *Tip: Toast the spices before using to bring out their full flavor.*\n\n2. **Include Citrus Zest** – Add a touch of orange or lemon zest (a few drops or a small amount) to brighten the rich sweetness and create a more balanced flavor profile.\n\n3. **Fold in Nuts** – Toasted pecans work especially well—add them to the dough or use them as a topping. They pair beautifully with caramel notes and add a satisfying texture. *Tip: Use toasted pecans for a warm, spiced contrast.*\n\n4. **Boost with Espresso or Coffee Extract** – A few drops of espresso extract deepen the flavor and create a sophisticated, bittersweet note.\n\n5. **Enhance with Vanilla Extract** – A classic addition that smooths out sweetness and adds richness.\n\n6. **Use Cocoa Powder or Dark Chocolate** – A small amount of cocoa powder in the dough intensifies the chocolate flavor with an earthy, complex note.\n\n7. **Add a Pinch of Flaky Sea Salt** – A tiny amount (1/4 tsp) enhances sweetness and brings out the caramel and chocolate notes, adding depth and balance.\n\n8. **Upgrade the Sugar** – Replace 1/4 to 1/2 of the granulated sugar with **muscovado or demerara sugar** for a caramel-rich depth:\n   - **Muscovado sugar**: Strong molasses and caramel flavor; use 1–2 tbsp (up to 25% of total sugar). Start small—adjust to taste.\n   - **Demerara sugar**: Milder caramel and toffee flavor; use 1–3 tbsp. Whisk well to avoid clumps.\n\n9. **Try a Caramelized Sugar Frosting** – For a topping, cook 3–4 tbsp of turbinado, muscovado, or demerara sugar to a caramel stage (350°F) and mix with 1/2 cup browned butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and vanilla. Whip until fluffy and apply to cookies for a rich, indulgent finish.\n\n**Recipe Inspiration**:  \nTry **Muscovado Chocolate Chip Cookies with Caramel Frosting**—toasted pecans in the dough and a muscovado-based cream cheese frosting for bold, molasses-caramel depth.\n\n**Key Tips**:  \n- Start with small substitutions (1–2 tbsp) to avoid overpowering the chocolate.  \n- Taste as you go—caramel flavors are potent.  \n- Whisk thoroughly to ensure even distribution.  \n- Adjust liquid content slightly if using these sugars, as they contain more moisture.  \n- Avoid overmixing to prevent a tough texture.\n\nThese enhancements will give your chocolate chip cookies a more complex, balanced, and delicious flavor profile—perfect for elevating a classic treat! 🍪✨", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.06794055201698514, "exact_match": 0.0, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.05520169851380043, "llm_score": 1}, "evaluation_time": 3.8060436248779297, "generation_time": 1849.842456817627}

Any tips?", "expected_answer": "The user would prefer responses that take into account their existing plans to replace the bedroom dresser and their interest in mid-century modern style, suggesting furniture layouts that accommodate the new dresser and incorporate elements of this design aesthetic. They might not prefer general furniture arrangement tips or suggestions that do not consider their specific design preferences.", "response": "Absolutely! Here are some thoughtful, practical tips for rearranging your bedroom furniture—inspired by mid-century modern design principles and directly informed by the hardware, materials, and functional layout guidance from your memory:\n\n---\n\n### 🛋️ Tips for Rearranging Your Bedroom Furniture (Mid-Century Modern-Inspired)\n\n1. **Choose a Central, Functional Piece**  \n   Position a mid-century modern dresser as the visual and functional heart of the room. Its clean lines, balanced proportions, and built-in storage make it ideal for organizing clothes, books, and toiletries—reducing clutter and creating a calm, intentional space.\n\n2. **Prioritize Symmetry and Balance**  \n   Place the dresser either centered or aligned with the bed’s headboard (e.g., directly opposite the foot of the bed). This creates a harmonious, balanced layout that enhances visual flow and promotes a peaceful atmosphere.\n\n3. **Opt for Natural Wood with Warm Tones**  \n   Select a dresser made from **walnut, oak, or teak**—all of which offer rich, warm tones and natural grain patterns. For a timeless, inviting look, go for **walnut with a satin finish**, which beautifully highlights the wood’s texture without appearing overly shiny or cold.\n\n4. **Use a Sleek, Understated Hardware Finish**  \n   Choose **satin brass or matte nickel knobs** or **long, linear pulls** to maintain the minimalist, elegant aesthetic of mid-century modern design. Avoid overly ornate or shiny hardware that can distract from the room’s calmness.\n\n5. **Maximize Function with Layered Storage**  \n   Combine the dresser with other storage solutions:  \n   - Use under-bed bins for seasonal items.  \n   - Add a small wall-mounted shelf or side table for books or decor.  \n   This creates a multi-level system that keeps the room organized and prevents overcrowding.\n\n6. **Ensure Accessibility and Comfort**  \n   Position the dresser at a comfortable height—around 30–34 inches—and within easy reach of the bed. This ensures that frequently used items (like socks, shirts, or makeup) are within arm’s reach, improving daily routines and reducing friction.\n\n7. **Match the Style to Your Existing Furniture**  \n   Choose a dresser that complements your bed frame, nightstands, or chairs in style and scale. Avoid bulky or mismatched pieces that disrupt the room’s flow. A mid-century modern dresser pairs beautifully with simple, clean-lined furniture.\n\n8. **Add Warm, Functional Lighting**  \n   Place a small, warm-toned lamp or LED strip on the dresser or nearby to create a cozy, inviting zone—especially useful in the evening. This enhances usability and adds ambiance without clutter.\n\n9. **Keep the Surface Minimal and Clean**  \n   Resist the urge to over-decorate the dresser surface. Only place essentials like a small mirror, a few books, or a lamp. This supports the mid-century modern principle of *less is more* and keeps the space feeling open and uncluttered.\n\n10. **Plan for Flexibility**  \n   If possible, choose a modular or adjustable dresser with removable shelves or expandable drawers. This allows you to adapt the layout as your needs evolve—whether it’s for new belongings or lifestyle changes.\n\n---\n\n💡 **Bonus Insight**:  \nThis thoughtful rearrangement isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about creating a space that supports your daily life with intention. Just like your journey from Lebanon to the U.S. and your focus on purpose-driven work, your bedroom can become a sanctuary of balance, function, and personal growth.\n\nStart small—rearrange one piece at a time—and let the room evolve with you.  \n\nYou’ve got this. 🌿✨  \n\n— *A data-driven, purpose-driven, and design-conscious guide to your bedroom transformation* 🛏️💡", "metric": {"f1_score": 0.09747899159663866, "exact_match": 0.0, "bert_score": 0, "rouge_score": 0.05573770491803279, "llm_score": 1}, "evaluation_time": 6.766476631164551, "generation_time": 3925.122283220291}
