    "text": "[1948-06-01 12:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I know, by rumor, that Peruzzo cursed Don Achille, and Don Achille lifted him up and threw him against a tree, where Peruzzo lay bleeding. I heard Lina talking about \"the past,\" which made me anxious. I imagined Don Achille revealing his evil nature, half animal, half mineral.\n[1950-10-01 08:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that I always supported my father. I promised my parents that I would study hard. I heard my mother shouting at my father for money. I heard my father say to me, \"Elena, you must study hard at school... if you're not the best student, then you'll have to go to work!\" I thought that although these words were spoken by my father, I felt they were forced out of him by my mother. These words frightened me.\n[1950-10-20 10:00:00] via Toledo | I saw myself hit twice by Lina with a paper wad dipped in ink, once in the hair and once in the white collar. I saw her not listening to the teacher, continuing to fling it at others. I know she's the same bad girl in front of everyone. I thought I found her very bad, and she left a deep impression on me.\n[1950-10-20 10:05:00] via Toledo | I saw Professor Oliviero stumble as he came down from the podium, his face crashing into the corner of a desk, and then he lay motionless on the floor. I saw Lina looking at her with a serious expression. I heard the teacher scream. I saw the teacher's body being thrown onto the ground like a black bundle. I thought that the teacher looked as if she were dead.\n[1950-10-20 10:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I know that Aunt Assunta's daughter died of tetanus, Spanuolo's son died of asthma, my cousin was crushed to death, my grandfather died when the building collapsed, and Peruso lost an arm, and so on. I thought of many accidents, realizing that our world is filled with deadly words and dangers.\n[1951-02-15 09:00:00] via Toledo | I saw Professor Oliviero return to the school alive and begin to care for and praise Lina. I thought she was dead, and I believed Lina would be sentenced to death. I am amazed by the change that has taken place.\n[1951-02-15 09:10:00] via Toledo | I saw Nunzia Lina come in, dressed in her black festive attire, bringing coffee and sugar for the teacher. I saw her swollen feet in high heels. I thought I almost didn't recognize her.\n[1951-02-15 09:15:00] via Toledo | I saw the teacher write a word on the blackboard (like \"sun\"). I saw Lina read it out, angry. I heard the teacher ask, \"Lina, what is written here?\" I heard Lina say, \"Sun.\" I heard the teacher say, \"Good! It really says 'Sun' on the blackboard.\" I saw the classroom fall silent. I felt somewhat confused, because I was the best student in the class.\n[1951-02-15 09:20:00] via Toledo | I saw Lina walk to the blackboard and write with a trembling hand. I heard the teacher telling her to write \"chalk.\" I heard Mrs. Lina say dejectedly, \"You wrote it wrong.\"\n[1951-02-15 09:25:00] via Toledo | I heard the teacher ask who had taught her, and Nunzia said she hadn't been taught. I heard the teacher, full of admiration, ask Lina: \"Who taught you to read and write?\" I heard Lina answer: \"I...\" I saw Lina then, very thin and small, wearing a dark smock, with a small pink flower on her neck.\n[1951-02-16 09:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I know that Rino is six years older than Lina, good at playing games and mending shoes, but can't read. I know that Lina probably learned to read when she was around three by looking at his textbooks, or more likely, by reading the old newspaper used to wrap shoes. I thought it was impossible that Rino had taught Lina by letting her copy his textbook, because he had never done any homework. I felt Lina's early maturity was due to those newspapers.\n[1951-02-16 09:10:00] Chiaia | I saw that I was listening very carefully to the teacher. I saw the gray, gloomy morning I remember. I thought about the feeling of weakness I had after the teacher showed that Lina could read. I felt that school was better than home, that it was a safe place. I realized that I liked to please the teacher, because I was unnecessary in my mother's life.\n[1951-02-16 22:00:00] Mergellina | I heard my mother stomping on a cockroach with the heel of her shoe. I heard her say it was a \"frustrated leg.\" I saw her with yellowing hair, blue eyes, a swollen figure, a crooked right eye, and a limp in her walk. I saw the cockroaches coming in from under the gate. I thought about how much I hated her body, and I felt she must be very unhappy. I imagined her eyes burning with anger.\n[1951-03-01 10:00:00] Chiaia | I often got called to the teacher's desk. I heard Professor Oliviero say, \"Greco, come sit in front of me.\" She said my blonde hair was beautiful. I realized that sitting in front of the teacher was a privilege. Later, when I saw the teacher calling Lina to sit beside her more often, I felt deeply disappointed and even a bit jealous.\n[1951-03-15 07:00:00] Mercato | I woke up in the morning and immediately checked my leg. I decided to follow Lina, imitating the way she walked, keeping a close eye on her. I saw Lina's legs were very thin and extremely flexible, kicking them back and forth. I thought about my fear of becoming lame. I believed that if I kept following Lina, my mother's way of walking wouldn't threaten me.\n[1952-05-20 10:00:00] Chiaia | I knew the principal organized at least two class competitions every year. Teacher Oliviero used me and Lina as weapons to compete against other classes. I thought that Lina was dazzling to me, but terrifying to others. I studied as hard as I could so I wouldn't fall behind her and so the teacher wouldn't only praise someone else.\n[1952-05-20 10:30:00] Chiaia | I see that I usually play as a forward. I recite poems, do calculations, and list mountain names. I saw Lina looking disheveled and dirty, with scars. I saw her eyes narrow to a slit before she gave a brilliant reply. I knew Lina could do complex math problems in her head, write them down accurately, and use formal vocabulary. I thought she was almost inhuman, and acknowledging her superiority was admitting my own mediocrity.\n[1952-11-01 09:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I heard Melina call out the child's name every night: \"Aida! Micaele!\" I know that Melina's husband is dead, and Donato Nino helped her. Melina fell in love with him and decided to fight against his wife, Lidia. I thought that what had once been interesting had now become frightening.\n[1952-11-05 20:00:00] Piazza Garibaldi | I saw my mother open the door to look. I heard Melina and Lydia's shouts and curses. I saw two female neighbors fighting and tumbling down the stairs, and I saw Melina's head hit the floor just a few centimeters from my shoes, like a broken white melon.\n[1952-11-10 13:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw Pinocchia pointing at Melina. I saw Lina slap Pinocchia hard, knocking her to the ground. I helped the weeping Pinocchia up. I heard Pinocchio say, \"That bitch!\"\n[1952-11-10 13:05:00] Stazione Centrale | I turned around and saw Lina, I saw her cross the street and stand close to Melina. I saw Melina holding a black soap and food in her hands. I thought I felt very uneasy. Now I realize she faced her pain firmly, silent like a stone sculpture.\n[1952-11-15 09:00:00] Mercato | I saw that we were brought to Professor Ferraro's class, which was for fourth graders. I saw Enzo Scanno, Nino Nino, and Alfonso Carracci also there. I saw Enzo wearing a sign around his neck that said \"Donkey.\" I know Enzo is a repeat student. Alfonso Carracci is the third child of Don Achille. I thought about how much I liked Nino. We both avoided Enzo because he was violent.\n[1952-11-15 10:00:00] Mercato | I saw us start a mental arithmetic competition. I saw Alfonso Carracci quickly overtake me. I saw Lina not answering questions actively. I heard Enzo shouting out the correct answer from the back of the classroom. I saw Nino looking dazed, barely answering questions. I was amazed by Nino's performance, and also by Lila's apparent reluctance to beat Don Achille's son. I was surprised when Enzo answered correctly.\n[1952-11-15 10:30:00] Mercato | I saw Enzo called to the blackboard for a duel with Lina. I saw Lina later squint her eyes, answering firmly and accurately, and finally winning. I saw the teacher punish Enzo. I heard Enzo answer in the dialect, and after losing, he started swearing. I saw Enzo with a sullen face, feeling both nervous and proud, and finally got his ear pulled. I saw that Lina had finally fully awakened.",

    "text": "[1952-11-15 12:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I know I can't offend Don Achille and his family. I thought about how I had figured out that Lina had deliberately chosen the right moment to not defeat Alfonso Carracci. I realized this fear and submission had been passed down to us from our parents.\n[1952-11-15 12:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw Nino's pale face, the red veins in his eyes. I saw Lina's face flush with warmth, radiating passion. I thought about how I suspected Nino might be deliberately keeping silent, just like Lina, and it hurt me. At that moment, I felt Lina was more beautiful than me, like a virgin warrior.\n[1952-11-16 16:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw Stefano threatening Lina, pushing her against the wall. I learned that Enzo had been hit by Stefano, and that Rino had fought with Stefano. I saw Madame Maria scolding Nunzia. I heard that Stefano threatened to stick a needle in Lina's tongue. I know we learned to use \"I didn't mean to\" to escape danger, but the consequences still erupted.\n[1952-11-20 10:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw and heard Fernando loudly apologize to Don Achille, but Don Achille ignored him. I remembered Enzo and Lina throwing stones, Lina getting hurt and bleeding, Enzo crying, and Rino hitting Enzo. I saw blood dripping from under Lina's hair. I knew that after Enzo was beaten, he didn't tell anyone, and the cycle of revenge came to an end. I thought about how I had screamed in fear at that moment.\n[1953-03-10 17:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw Enzo throwing stones at us, and we ran away, but I saw Lina didn't run. She calmly dodged the stones. I stopped and waited for her. I know that Enzo is called \"the hoodlum Enzo.\" I thought about how I had realized she possessed a certain elegance. I had developed some sort of feeling for her, something that made it impossible for me to leave her behind; I felt that if I ran away alone, I would lose something irretrievable.\n[1953-03-10 17:05:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw myself hand Lina a sharp stone, and she hit Enzo in the ankle. I grabbed her arm to pull her away, but Enzo's thrown stone struck Lina on the forehead. I held her tightly, watching her lie on the sidewalk. I saw blood gushing from Enzo's ankle, saw him stop in surprise. I saw Lina's head broken open. I thought the group of boys would be more aggressive, and I felt filled with fear.\n[1953-03-10 18:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself sometimes covering my ears with my hands. I heard my parents cursing Don Achille, and I heard my mother denying the family relation. I knew Mr. Peluso was the mortal enemy of Don Achille, having lost his carpentry workshop due to gambling and debt. I thought about how I was afraid that Don Achille would hear the shouting and kill us. I imagined Don Achille followed by thousands of tools or carnivores, like a swarm of bees.\n[1953-04-15 16:00:00] Porto | I remember her taking my doll and throwing it into the cellar. We had to go down, to look for it. I thought that, in my mind, it was really her fault. I felt that whether going up or down, we were both heading toward fear.\n[1953-04-15 16:05:00] Porto | I saw myself talking to my doll. I looked at my doll, her face, hair, and eyes made of celluloid, wearing a light blue dress my mother had sewn. I looked at Lina's doll, made of rags, ugly and dirty. I thought that I felt my doll knew more than me. I imagined the two dolls watching each other, always ready to run away.\n[1953-04-15 16:10:00] Porto | I saw us pretending not to be together in the courtyard. Lina sat on one side of the small window in the basement, and I on the other. We placed pebbles, bottle corks, and glass fragments along the iron grid. I wandered around her, then later sat by the window. I heard myself speaking in the local dialect to the doll: \"Tina, put on your queen's crown, or you'll catch a cold.\"\n[1953-04-15 16:15:00] Porto | I watched as we scattered through the holes in the iron grid, throwing stones into the basement and listening to the sound they made when they hit the floor. Sometimes we placed the dolls near the opening. I felt the cold air blowing out from the basement, saw the spiderwebs on the iron bars and the rusted mesh. I heard the terrifying rustling sounds below. I thought about how I felt excited and scared. I imagined Don Achille as the spider among spiders, with a gaping mouth and a black backpack, gathering everything we threw down into it.\n[1953-04-15 16:20:00] Porto | I saw us exchanging the doll through our eyes and gestures. I saw her, as soon as she got Tina, throw Tina out of the hole. I saw the doll fall into darkness. I know Lina knows I'm very afraid.\n[1953-04-15 16:25:00] Porto | I saw and felt the pain. I saw Lina, without a word, throw my doll down. I heard Lina ask, \"Don't you care?\" I saw tears welling up in my eyes. I knew from that moment on, we were both daring. I thought that I felt the celluloid doll was my most precious thing, and I was overwhelmed with despair. I learned to suppress my despair.\n[1953-04-15 16:26:00] Porto | I saw myself throwing her doll Nao into the basement. I saw the look of surprise in her eyes. I heard myself shouting, \"Whatever you do, I'll do the same! Now, go down and pick it up for me.\" I know I'm taking a risk, my heart is filled with extreme fear, but I have to do it.\n[1953-04-15 16:30:00] Mergellina | I saw us squeeze into the basement through the dilapidated small door. Lina went in first, and I followed her down five stone steps. I heard her say, \"If you pick up my doll too.\" I saw that the door was held up by only one hinge. The basement was damp and dark, with only a small hole letting in light. I thought about how we were filled with fear.\n[1953-04-15 16:35:00] Mergellina | I saw myself stumbling forward. I saw a face hanging there and screamed. I saw Lina put the thing on her face, and I screamed in terror; she then threw it away. I heard Lina say that it was just a gas mask. I heard the creaking sound beneath my feet. I saw broken chairs, scrap metal. I saw the glass eyes and black elongated chin of a gas mask, and the rising dust. I thought about how scared I was, that face filled me with fear.\n[1953-04-15 16:40:00] Mergellina | I saw that we had been looking for the doll but hadn't found it. I thought I saw Tina, but it was just a newspaper. I followed Lina through the broken door and gave up on Tina. I heard Lina say, \"The baby was taken by Don Achille, he put it in a black bag.\" I felt lost and confused. I seemed to hear the sound of Don Achille crawling like a snake.\n[1953-05-01 10:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that I had a feverish illness, recurring again and again. I saw the solid surfaces of objects become soft and swollen. I felt my cheeks round as a ball, my hands covered in scars, my earlobes like overripe rowan berries. I felt myself squeezed between an expanding balloon underground and Don Achille's balloon, trapped by the iron bars. I thought about believing Lina's words, imagining Don Achille holding the doll. I felt nauseated and exhausted, as if I were about to be squeezed into a pulp.\n[1953-05-15 18:00:00] Pigneto | I saw myself and Lina decide to climb that dark staircase, step by step, floor by floor, until we reached Don Achille's door. I saw that I remembered there was a purple light in the courtyard, and the air was filled with the scent of a spring night. I thought about the day I realized we had begun our friendship.\n[1953-05-15 18:01:00] Albergheria | I saw the mothers preparing dinner, but we didn't go home; instead, we were competing with each other. Although I had never spoken to Lina, we were both trying to prove who was braver.\n[1953-05-15 18:02:00] Albergheria | I remember Lina putting her arm into the sewer, and I did the same; she jumped down from the window railing at Mrs. Spagnuolo's house, and I did the same; she stuck a rusted French brooch into her palm, and I did as she did. I saw the dark, gaping hole of the sewer, and the white metal tip that left a white gash on her palm. I thought my heart was pounding, I hoped the cockroach wouldn't crawl up, the mouse wouldn't bite me; I was afraid of falling and hurting myself.\n[1953-05-15 18:05:00] Borgo | I saw her look at me with her unique, determined squint, then turn her gaze toward the building where Don Achille lived. I know everyone both hates and fears him. I thought I was terrified, and I felt that Don Achille was a monster made of iron, glass, and nettles. I imagined him as a man with a rugged face, breathing hot air from his nose and mouth, and I felt that even looking at him from afar would hurt my eyes, and getting close to him would mean death.\n[1953-05-15 18:06:00] Porto | I hesitated for a moment, then finally decided to follow her through the dark doorway. I found Lina sitting on the first step of the first staircase, and then she stood up, and we began to climb upward. I couldn't see anything at first, only smelled old objects and DDT insecticide, and later my eyes adjusted to the darkness. I thought about my futile hope that she might change her mind or forget the matter, but I knew I had to follow her.\n[1953-05-15 18:08:00] Porto | I saw us walking along the flaking plastered wall, she in front, me behind. I was trembling. I saw that I felt those steps were higher than the ones in our building. I heard some footsteps or a sound. I found myself caught in a contradiction, unsure whether to get close or put distance between us. I imagined Don Achille appearing with the knife he used to gut chickens, the hallway filled with the smell of fried garlic. I fantasized that his wife would throw me into the frying pan, and he would suck the thoughts out of my brain.\n[1953-05-15 18:10:00] Porto | I saw us stopping now and then, I saw her looking up. We stopped for a moment, then Lina continued walking, and I followed behind her. I saw the lights suddenly come on, weak and dusty, with many corners still immersed in darkness. Above me were large gray windows. I didn't hear the sound of doors opening or closing. I thought about wanting Lina to step back, my whole body was sweaty. I wanted to figure out if it was Don Achille who had turned on the light.\n[1953-05-15 18:12:00] Porto | I saw us slowly approaching the person we had feared most in those years. When we reached the fourth step of the stairs, Lina stopped to wait for me, she reached out her hand to me. I realized that I was there because she was there. I felt that this act of holding hands completely changed our relationship.",

    "text": "[1953-06-15 11:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw myself leaving home to buy bread, clutching the change tightly in my hand. Nino blocked my way and pushed me against the wall. I ran past him. I heard him say, \"When we grow up, I'll marry you.\" He asked if I wanted to date him. I replied, \"No, I can't.\" I saw Nino pale-faced, holding his younger brother Pinocchio. I thought I was moved, and I even wanted to marry him, but I was still in the pain of Tina's disappearance, so I refused. I felt he had chosen the wrong time.\n[1954-03-10 09:00:00] Albergheria | I saw Nino's family moving out from the window. I took my hands off my ears and saw copper pots, irons, and other things flying out of Melina's window. I saw an iron fall just a few centimeters away from Nino. I heard Melina's scream and the sound of things being thrown. I heard Pinocchia cry, \"Mom, don't do this!\" I saw Lydia protecting the child, and Nicola pulling the frightened horse. I saw the iron had left a hole in the ground. I felt weak, and I was filled with guilt for having once refused Nino. I saw Lina looking completely lost.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:00] Staircase | I saw that time, and I decided with Lina to climb up that dark staircase. I saw that before me was that dark staircase.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:05] Corridor | I saw us climbing one step at a time, layer by layer, upward.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:10] Staircase | I saw us walk all the way to Don Achille's house. I thought that was the day we began our friendship.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:15] Courtyard | I saw what I remembered: there was a purple light in the courtyard.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:20] Courtyard | I see and smell the scent of a spring night in the air.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:25] Courtyard | I saw and felt that all the mothers were cooking dinner. I realized it was time to go home for dinner.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:30] Courtyard | I saw that we didn't go home right away, but instead kept challenging each other.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:35] Courtyard | I saw us competing to see who had the bigger courage. I know that although I and Lina have never spoken a word to each other.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:40] School Inside and Outside | I knew this competition had been going on for a while, both inside and outside of school, we were always competing with each other.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:45] Storm Drain Entrance | I saw myself reaching my hand, even my whole arm, into the sewer hole. I saw the dark, gaping hole of the sewer.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:50] Manhole entrance | I saw it and immediately reached in with my hand. I thought of it, but my heart was pounding.\n[1954-05-15 18:30:55] Manhole entrance | I thought I hoped the cockroaches wouldn't crawl up my arm, and that the mice wouldn't bite me.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's window | I saw Lina climbing up the window of Mrs. Spagnuolo, the woman who lived on the first floor, hanging from the iron bars of the window. I knew that was where the clothesline was tied.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:05] Mrs. Spagnuolo's window | I saw her hanging there, swaying her body, then suddenly jumped onto the sidewalk.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:10] Mrs. Spanuolo's window | I saw it and immediately did the same. I thought about it, but I was afraid of falling and hurting myself.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:15] Street | I saw Lina stick a brooch into her skin. I saw that it was a rust-stained French brooch.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:20] Street | I heard her say it was a gift from a fairy. I knew she had picked it up on the way, and she had been keeping the brooch in her pocket all along.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:25] Street | I saw the white metal tip making a white cut on her palm. I saw that white metal tip and the white slit.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:30] Street | I saw her hand the pin to me, and I did the same as she did.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:35] Street | At that moment, she looked at me with a gaze that was uniquely hers. I saw her eyes narrowed, very determined.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:40] Street | I saw and then she looked at the building where Don Achille lived.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:45] Street | I thought I was frozen with fear because Don Achille was a monster from a fairy tale.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:50] Street | I thought to myself that I absolutely couldn't get close to him, couldn't look at him, couldn't speak to him, couldn't spy on him.\n[1954-05-15 18:31:55] Street | I thought about pretending that he and his whole family didn't exist.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:00] Street | I know that it's not just in my family—everyone feels a mix of hatred and fear towards him. I thought about how I didn't know where this feeling came from.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:05] Street | I thought of the way my father spoke about Don Achille, which made me imagine him as a tall man with a rugged face and a very short temper.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:10] Street | I thought that, although he was addressed as \"Don,\" the person who bore that title should have been someone calm and serene, a figure of quiet authority.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:15] Street | I thought of him as made up of some indescribable materials: iron, glass, and nettle.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:20] Street | I saw and felt his hot breath coming out of his nose and mouth. I thought of him, but he was a living person.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:25] Street | I thought to myself that even seeing him from afar would hurt my eyes.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:30] Street | I thought that if I dared to approach his house, he would certainly kill me.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:35] Street | I hesitated for a moment, hoping Lina might change her mind and go back. I know what she wants to do.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:40] Street | I thought I had vainly hoped she would forget that thing, but she hadn't.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:45] Street | I saw that the streetlights weren't on yet, and the lights in the hallway were also dim.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:50] Street | I heard unsettling sounds coming from the house.\n[1954-05-15 18:32:55] Main Gate | I saw that to keep up with Lina's pace, I had to leave the pale blue light of the courtyard. I saw the pale blue daylight before me.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:00] Inside the gate | I saw myself going into the dark gate. I saw the black door before me.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:05] Corridor | I saw that I had finally decided to follow her in. I saw at the beginning, I could see nothing.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:10] Corridor | I saw only some old objects, and I smelled the scent of DDT insecticide.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:15] Corridor | I saw my eyes finally adjust to the darkness.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:20] Corridor | I saw that Lina was sitting on the first step of the first flight of stairs.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:25] Corridor | I saw her stand up at that moment, and we began to climb upward.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:30] Corridor | I saw us walking along the wall, she ahead of me by two steps, and I following behind.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:35] Corridor | I thought I felt conflicted, unsure whether I should catch up to shorten the distance between us or put more space between us.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:40] Corridor | I saw us walking with our shoulders against the wall where the plaster was peeling off. I saw and felt the plaster on the walls peeling off.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:45] Corridor | I thought to myself at that moment: I had a feeling that those steps were very high, higher than the stairs in our building.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:50] Staircase | I saw myself trembling.\n[1954-05-15 18:33:55] Corridor | I thought I heard the sound of footsteps, any kind of noise seemed to be Don Achille appearing behind us or coming straight toward us.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:00] Corridor | I thought of him holding a long knife, like the kind used to open up chickens.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:05] Corridor | I saw and smelled the oily stir-fried garlic scent spreading through the hallway.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:10] Corridor | I thought about how the wife of Don Achille, Maria, would throw me into a pot of hot oil, and the children would eat me.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:15] Corridor | I thought about how Don Achille would suck out my brain and swallow it, just like my father ate fish heads.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:20] Corridor | I saw that we sometimes stopped. I thought to myself that every time, I wished Lina would step back.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:25] Corridor | I saw and felt that I was sweating all over. I thought I didn't know how she felt.\n[1954-05-15 18:34:30] Corridor | I saw her glancing up occasionally. I thought about it, but I didn't know what she was looking at.",

I thought about how we went to explore and question our own fears.\n[1954-05-15 18:35:20] Corridor | I had just reached the fourth step when Lina surprised me: she stopped and waited for me a moment. I was surprised by her performance.\n[1954-05-15 18:35:25] Corridor | I saw that I caught up with her, and she reached out her hand to me.\n[1954-05-15 18:35:30] Corridor | I thought that this action had completely changed our relationship.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:00] Classroom | I saw Professor Oliviero fall off the podium that day, his cheekbone hitting the corner of the desk. I know, just as I said before.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:05] Classroom | I thought she was dead, like my grandfather or Melina's husband, who died at their places of work.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:10] Classroom | I thought that I felt Lina was to blame, that she would be sentenced to death.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:15] School | I knew that after a while, both of them disappeared — the teacher and the student vanished from our lives. I thought about how I couldn't explain how long it had been.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:20] Classroom | I saw Professor Oliviero return to the school alive, and she began to take care of Lina. I thought what happened afterward was astonishing; the teacher kept praising her instead of punishing her.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:25] Classroom | I saw Nunzia Lina coming in immediately. I saw her, but I almost didn't recognize her, because she had appeared in her festive attire that day.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:30] Classroom | I saw her, dressed all in black, holding a black leather handbag, the high heels causing her swollen feet great discomfort.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:35] Classroom | I saw her bring the teacher two packages, one was coffee and the other was sugar.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:40] Classroom | I saw the teacher happily accepting the gift, her eyes on Lina. I couldn't quite figure out what she meant when she spoke about Lina's mother and everyone else in the class.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:45] Classroom | I know my grades are the best in the class, and I always win the three-color medal. I thought, but what's astonishing is that Lina made the teacher fall and end up in the hospital, and now the teacher says that the best student in the class is her.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:50] Classroom | I saw that at this point the teacher stopped. I thought she couldn't find the right words, or perhaps she wanted to tell Lina's mother that the truth spoke louder than words.\n[1954-05-15 18:36:55] Classroom | I saw her take a piece of chalk and write the word \"sun\" on the blackboard. I heard her ask Lina, \"Lina, what does this say here?\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:00] Classroom | I saw Lina turn away, muttering angrily. I heard \"Sun.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:05] Classroom | I saw Nunzia Lina looking at the teacher, and Oliviero seemed not to understand. I wondered why Lina's mother wasn't as enthusiastic as I was?\n[1954-05-15 18:37:10] Classroom | I saw the teacher frown. She said, to explain the situation to Lina and also to praise our classmate. I heard, \"Very good! It really says 'Sun' on the blackboard.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:15] Classroom | I saw Lina reluctantly walk to the blackboard, and the teacher handed her a piece of chalk. I heard, \"You write 'chalk'...\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:20] Classroom | I saw Lina very focused, her hand trembling, writing a \"fenshi\" in a wobbly, crooked way.\n[1954-05-15 18:37:25] Classroom | I saw Professor Oliviero complete the word, and Mrs. Lina saw the teacher's correction. I heard her say to her daughter, \"You made a mistake.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:30] Classroom | I saw Teacher Dan immediately assured Mrs. Lina. I heard, \"No, there's no problem. Lina should definitely practice, but she can already read and write. The question is who taught her?\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:35] Classroom | I saw Mrs. Lina lower her head. I heard \"I didn't teach.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:40] Classroom | I saw the teacher looking at Lina with genuine admiration, and he asked her in front of all of us. \"I heard, 'Who taught you to read and write? Lina...\"\n[1954-05-15 18:37:45] Classroom | I heard her answer, \"I...\" I saw her, only six years old, very small and thin, with dark hair, wearing a dark smock.\n[1954-05-15 18:37:50] Lina's house/shop | I knew Lina's early maturity was probably due to those newspaper wrappers that covered the shoes, which her father sometimes brought home.\n[1954-05-15 18:37:55] Classroom | I thought back to that gloomy morning, and the clearest memory I had was the feeling of weakness I experienced after hearing the news.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:00] Home | I thought about it at home, and the problem was with my mother; my relationship with her wasn't good.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:05] Home | I saw that her hair was yellow, her eyes were blue, her body was stout, and her right eye was crooked. I thought about how I especially hated her body.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:10] Home | I saw her walking with a limp, her steps made me very uneasy. I heard the sound of her heel crushing a cockroach.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:15] Home | I heard my father say to me, \"If you don't study hard, if you're not the best at studying, then you'll have to go to work! Dad needs help...\" I knew that on the first day of my school, it was my father, not my mother, who said those words to me.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:20] Classroom | I know that later, Mrs. Lina came to the class, and Teacher Oliviero showed us that Lina's progress had far surpassed ours. I thought about it, and it made me feel very depressed inside.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:25] School | I thought, just at that point, I began to feel a worry: I felt I was still very likely to become a cripple.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:30] School | I remember having a belief back then: if I kept following Lina, imitating the way she walked, then my mother's way of walking would no longer threaten me.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:35] School | I thought about how I decided to follow that girl, to keep a close eye on her, even if she would be annoying, even if she would chase me away.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:40] School | I saw that I had given my all, not only to studying but also to many difficult things. I thought it was just to keep up with that girl, that terrifying and dazzling girl.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:45] Other classes | I saw Professor Oliviero often took us to other classes to compete with other children. I know sometimes it's the principal's idea.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:50] Other Classes | I know I usually play as a forward, probing the opponent's strength. I thought that I usually win, but it's not exaggerated, and I don't want to make other teachers and students feel ashamed.\n[1954-05-15 18:38:55] Other Classes | I know things are different with Lina; for anyone, Lina is too strong, and she would certainly win without any hesitation.",

I knew that class had the mischievous son of the vegetable seller, Enzo Scanno, and the older brother of Pinochia, Nino Nino.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:05] Elena's class | I saw our classes combined, and everyone was competing in a large classroom.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:10] Elena's Class | I saw Alfonso Carracci·Carracci quickly get eliminated, and Lina and Enzo began their duel under the teacher's approving gaze. I thought this would surprise the students, teachers, principal, Lina, and me.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:15] Elena's class | I saw Enzo come to the blackboard and stand opposite Lina. I saw him with a dark expression, very uncomfortable.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:20] Rino's class | I saw Lina seem to awaken completely at the last moment. I saw her squinting her eyes, very determined.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:25] Elena's class | I saw Enzo lose in the end, but he refused to admit it and started cursing.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:30] Outside the school | I knew that from that time on, those boys started throwing stones at us.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:35] Outside the school / at home | I thought about the confrontation between her and Enzo that morning, an event of great importance in our long story.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:40] Outside the school / Home | I thought to myself: Lina is more beautiful than me, I can't compare to her in anything.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:45] Courtyard | I saw us meeting in the courtyard often, taking out our dolls.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:50] Yard | I saw that day, sitting next to the broken vent in the basement, we exchanged dolls.\n[1954-05-15 18:39:55] Courtyard | At that moment, Lina remained calm and threw my doll down through the hole in the ventilation duct.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:00] Courtyard | I thought of the unbearable pain I felt, and I realized that the celluloid doll was the most precious thing I had.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:05] Courtyard | I knew Lina was bad, but I never thought she would do something so evil.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:10] Courtyard | I saw Lina speaking to me in the local dialect. I heard, \"Don't you care?\"\n[1954-05-15 18:40:15] Courtyard | I said nothing, just calmly did something. I thought about how I was experiencing an extreme pain, but I felt that arguing with her would only make me even more painful.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:20] Courtyard | I saw myself just throwing her doll, the Nory she had just given me, into the basement. I know I'm taking a risk.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:25] Courtyard | I saw Lina looking at me with a surprised expression, so I immediately said loudly. I heard, \"Whatever you do, I'll do too!\"\n[1954-05-15 18:40:30] Courtyard | I saw us going down together. \"I heard, 'Now, go down and bring it back for me.' 'If you bring back my doll too.'\"\n[1954-05-15 18:40:35] Basement Entrance | I saw us push the door open to the width we could fit through, and slip into the basement through the crack. I saw a chain locking the two doors together.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:40] Basement | I saw that there were five stone steps after we went in. I saw and felt myself entering a damp place.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:45] Basement | I saw a tiny hole in the road surface through which some light came in, but the basement was still very dark.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:50] Basement | I saw us stumbling forward. I thought I was scared and wanted to stay close to Lina.\n[1954-05-15 18:40:55] Basement | I heard a creaking sound under my shoes, the sound of glass, pebbles, and insects.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:00] Basement | I saw something that terrified me very much, it looked like a soft, limp face with two huge glass eyes. I thought about how scared I was.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:05] Basement | I saw and screamed, pointing to Lina, who put the thing on her face.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:10] Basement | I saw myself still trembling, screaming in fear, and she quickly took off the mask and threw it into a corner. I heard a crackling sound.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:15] Basement | I saw us moving forward along the rough, clumpy walls damp with moisture, searching in the dark.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:20] Basement | I saw Lina searching on the ground with her hands.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:25] Basement | I saw myself reaching out to take it, but it was just a crumpled piece of newspaper. I thought for a moment that I had suddenly seen Tina, and my heart started racing.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:30] Basement | I saw her walk toward the door, and she said standing on the steps. I heard, \"The child was taken by Don Achille, he put her in a black bag.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:41:35] Basement | I saw and felt him moving like a snake among those nameless things, rustling as he crawled. I thought I heard Don Achille's voice.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:40] Basement/Garden | I saw Lina had already wriggled out through the broken door.\n[1954-05-15 18:41:45] Courtyard | I saw that in order to keep up with her, I had no choice but to give up Tina.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:00] Courtyard | I believed everything she said.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:05] Yard | I thought I could almost imagine Don Achille's indescribable body running back and forth in the underground Mercato.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:10] Courtyard | I thought of him with his arms hanging down, long fingers, one hand holding Nino's head, the other holding Tina's head.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:15] Courtyard | I thought about it and felt extremely painful.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:20] Home | I know I had a growth spurt, and then I got sick again, going back and forth like that.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:25] Home | I saw that everything around me had sped up its pace. I know my sense of feeling is malfunctioning.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:30] Home | I saw and felt the solid surface of the object become soft beneath my fingers, or the outer layer of the object swelled and separated from the inside.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:35] Home | I felt as if my own body was also swollen. I thought of it and it made me very sad.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:40] Home | I thought about how my cheeks had grown round as a ball, how my hands were covered with scars, how my earlobes looked like overripe rowan berries, how my fingers were full of cracks, and how my feet were swollen like round loaves of bread.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:45] Street/School | I thought about walking on the street or at school, and I felt that space had changed.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:50] Street/School | I thought I felt myself caught between the two extremes of darkness.\n[1954-05-15 18:42:55] Street/School | I thought of how, on one side, the underground balloon kept expanding, pressing against the house's foundation, and the cellar where the two dolls had fallen.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:00] Street/School | I thought I imagined another balloon pressing down from above—that was Don Achille, who lived on the fifth floor, and he had stolen our doll.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:05] Street/School | I thought that in my imagination, the two balloons seemed to be caught by iron bars, a fence that crossed diagonally through the house, the street, the countryside, Mercato, and the railway tracks, squeezing everything from above and below.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:10] Street/School | I thought about myself, the people and things I encountered every day, all of us trapped together behind iron bars.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:15] Street/School | I saw something that made my mouth feel bitter, and I've been feeling nauseous and exhausted ever since. I thought as if everything around me was pressing in, getting tighter and tighter, and I was going to be squeezed into a pile of disgusting mush.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:20] Home | I knew this illness was stubborn and might last for several years, right up until adolescence.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:25] Street | I knew that when I first got sick, to my surprise, it was the first time in my life that someone confessed their love to me.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:30] Street | I knew I hadn't yet gone upstairs to see Don Achille, and I was still reeling from the pain of losing Tina.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:35] Street | I saw myself reluctantly going out to buy bread for the house, sent by my mother.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:40] Street | I saw that I was walking home, clutching the change tightly in my hand. I thought about how scared I was of losing my change.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:45] Street | I saw myself walking with my head down, my chin resting on my chest, and I noticed Nino, Nino was following me with his brother.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:50] Street | I know that in the summer, Nino's mother Lidia always made him go out with Pinocchio.\n[1954-05-15 18:43:55] Street | I saw Nino catch up with me in an instant, but instead of overtaking me, he blocked my way.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:00] Street | I saw him push me against the wall, his free hand blocking in front of me so I couldn't run away, while the other hand pulled my younger brother.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:05] Street | I saw his younger brother silently watching his feat, and Nino, out of breath, said something in a language I couldn't understand.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:10] Street | I saw his face was pale, at first smiling, then turning serious, and finally smiling again.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:15] Street | I saw him speak to me in Italian, the way he had learned at school. I heard, \"When we grow up, I'll marry you.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:44:20] Street | I heard and then he asked me, whether I was willing to date him before that.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:25] Street | I saw him, he was a bit taller than me, very thin, with a long neck and slightly prominent ears. His hair was messy, his eyes were sharp and full of life, and his eyelashes were long.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:30] Street | I thought about how he had overcome his shyness and gathered great courage to confess his feelings for me, which moved me deeply.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:35] Street | I heard myself say, \"No, I can't.\" I thought, although I also wanted to marry him.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:40] Street | I saw him staring in surprise, his mouth wide open. At that moment, Pinocchio pulled him, and he ran away.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:45] Street | I saw that from then on, every time I saw him, I would avoid him. I thought, even though I found him very handsome.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:50] Street | I would approach Pinochcia, his sister, just to be with them on the way home. I thought about how many times.\n[1954-05-15 18:44:55] Street | I thought it was obvious—he had chosen the wrong time to confess. He couldn't possibly know how confused I was.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:00] Street | I thought about how Tina's disappearance had brought me so much pain, the courtyard, the building, and even Mergellina made me feel suffocated.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:05] Street | I saw him always watching me from a distance. I thought that I felt he was a bit timid.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:10] Street | I saw it for a while, and he began to avoid me.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:15] Street | I thought that for a while, he must have been worried that I would tell other girls about his confession to me, especially his sister.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:20] School | I know everyone knows that when Enzo confessed his feelings to Giyola Spagnuolo, she did exactly that, and Enzo was very angry when he found out.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:25] School | I knew Enzo was arguing loudly with her downstairs at the school, calling her a liar and threatening to cut her up with a knife.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:30] Street | I thought I had also wanted to tell someone about this, but in the end, I didn't say anything to anyone.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:35] Street | I didn't tell her about it even after becoming friends with Lina. I thought that, slowly, I would also forget.",

    "text": "[1954-05-15 18:45:40] Courtyard | I didn't remember the incident until some time had passed, when Nino's family moved away. I knew that that morning, the husband of the vegetable seller Aunt Sunta, Nicola, appeared in the courtyard.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:45] Courtyard | I saw the old broken horse cart they still used to sell vegetables in town.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:50] Courtyard | I saw Nicola's broad face, blue eyes, and hair just like his son Enzo's—golden.\n[1954-05-15 18:45:55] Courtyard | I saw Donato Nino, Nino, and Lidia carrying everything down, and Nicola placing each item on the cart.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:00] Courtyard | I saw the women in the building, including my mother, all sticking their heads out the window to look. I saw them hearing the sound of the carriage in the courtyard.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:05] Yard | I saw it, and I went to see it too. I thought everyone was very curious.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:10] Courtyard | I thought that the National Railway Bureau had given Donato a new apartment near the National Square.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:15] Courtyard | I thought, or as my mother put it, they moved to escape Melina's persecution, and it was most likely his wife who forced him to move.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:20] Yard | I thought about how my mother always saw the worst in everything, and it made me feel disgusted.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:25] Courtyard | I thought so, but later I quickly realized my mother was right. Her cross eye seemed born just to spy on the secrets of the neighborhood.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:30] Courtyard | I wondered what Melina's reaction would be.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:35] Courtyard | I heard someone say that Melina and Nino had a child who was later killed, but I don't know if it's true.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:40] Yard | I saw that, at that moment, all the women—big and small—were standing by the window.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:45] Courtyard | I saw Lina and her mother leaning out of the window. I thought maybe it was to say goodbye to this family, or perhaps to see the ugly, thin widow get angry.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:50] Yard | I saw myself searching for Nino's gaze, but he seemed to be occupied with something else.\n[1954-05-15 18:46:55] Courtyard | I saw something that made everything around me start to distort. I thought I felt extremely weak.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:00] Courtyard | I thought, he confessed to me probably because he knew he was leaving. Before he left, he wanted to tell me his feelings.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:05] Courtyard | I saw him rushing back and forth, moving boxes filled with things. I thought about how guilty I felt, how painful it was to have once refused him.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:10] Courtyard | I thought that now he had flown away like a bird.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:15] Courtyard | I saw it all, and the line of people moving furniture and other odd items came to a stop.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:20] Courtyard | I saw Nicola and Donato throw the rope up and secure the things on the cart.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:25] Courtyard | I saw Lydia Nino come out, pushing a baby carriage with her young son inside. I saw her, dressed in her festive clothes, wearing a blue straw hat on her head.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:30] Courtyard | I saw two older children following along: Pinocchia, about my age, and Clelia, who was six.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:35] Courtyard | I saw that I suddenly heard the sound of something being thrown from the third floor, and almost at the same time, everyone heard Melina's scream.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:40] Courtyard | I saw Lina covering her ears with her hands. I heard a heart-wrenching cry of pain.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:45] Courtyard | I heard her saying in a sorrowful voice, \"Mom, don't do this! Mom!\" I saw this, and then I heard the sorrowful voice of Melina's daughter, Pinocchia.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:50] Yard | I saw that after a while, I also covered my ears.\n[1954-05-15 18:47:55] Courtyard | I was watching when suddenly I saw something fly out of the window. I thought, out of curiosity, to take my hand away from my ear to find out what was happening.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:00] Courtyard | I saw that Melina didn't say anything, but kept shouting continuously. I heard \"Ah! Ah! Ah!\" I felt as if I had been hurt.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:05] Courtyard | I saw her throwing things, but I couldn't see her arms or hands; I only saw the copper pot, cups, bottles, and plates flying out of the window. I thought they seemed to have flown out on their own.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:10] Courtyard | I saw Lydia Nino walking quickly down the road, her back bent, holding the baby stroller, with several children following behind her.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:15] Courtyard | I saw Donato climb onto the cart and lie on top of his things, while Nicola tightly held the horse's bridle. I saw the horse's hooves restless and kicking.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:20] Courtyard | I saw the object thrown from upstairs hit the road, bounce up, and shatter into pieces at the horse's hooves.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:25] Courtyard | I searched for Lina with my eyes, and saw a face that was different from usual. I saw her face full of confusion.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:30] Courtyard | I saw her disappear quickly from the window. I thought she must have felt me watching her.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:35] Courtyard | I saw the carriage set off, moving along the wall.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:40] Courtyard | I saw them leave without saying goodbye to anyone. Lydia and the four young children kept their heads down as they walked toward the iron gate.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:45] Yard | I saw that Nino didn't seem to want to leave. I thought he probably felt sorry that those fragile things had broken on the floor.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:50] Courtyard | I saw it in the end — a dark figure flew out of the window, it was an ironing board, the kind made entirely of iron: the handle and the base were both made of iron.\n[1954-05-15 18:48:55] Courtyard | I know that before I had truly lost Tina, I played with her using my mother's iron, pretending it was a boat in a storm.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:00] Yard | I saw the iron that was thrown down, which was exactly the same as my mother's, and it flew out like a boat, point first.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:05] Courtyard | I saw the iron fall with a thud just a few centimeters from Nino, making a hole in the floor.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:10] Yard | I thought of how close I came—how nearly I took his life.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:15] Street | I know that no boy has ever confessed his love to Lina, and she never said that she felt hurt because of it.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:20] Street | I know that many boys have confessed their love to Giorgio Spagnuolo, and many have also confessed to me.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:25] Street | I know no one likes Lina, first of all because she's as thin as a bamboo stick, dirty, and always has bruises on her body.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:30] Street | I know this because she had a very sharp tongue, always giving people insulting nicknames and liked to show off her rich Italian vocabulary in front of the teacher.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:35] Street | I know she always spoke to us in a vulgar dialect, filled with lots of swear words, which killed any budding love.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:40] Street | I knew that only Enzo had shown her some attention; if it wasn't considered a declaration of love, it could at least be seen as an expression of admiration and respect.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:45] Street | I know it was long after Enzo had broken Lina's head, before he confessed his love to Giggia Spagnuolo.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:50] Street | I remember seeing it, when I was walking on the main road with Lina, and he caught up with us. Under my surprised gaze, he handed Lina a wreath of rowan blossom.\n[1954-05-15 18:49:55] Street | I heard, \"What's wrong?\" \"You can eat it...\" \"Raw?\" \"You can wait until it's cooked.\" \"I don't want it.\" \"Then just throw it away.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:50:00] Street | I saw Enzo finish speaking and then turn to go back to work, and Lina and I started laughing.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:05] Street | I know we don't talk much, but whenever something happens, we always start by laughing.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:10] Street | I saw myself speaking to her in an interested tone. I heard, \"Rowan berries, I like them...\"\n[1954-05-15 18:50:15] Street | I realized I was actually lying; I didn't like rowan berries at all.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:20] Street | When the rowan berries were not yet ripe, I found the color, which was red with a hint of yellow, very tempting. In the sunlight, their fruits were dazzling.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:25] Street | When I see the butan fruits ripening slowly on the balcony, they turn brown and soft, like small rotten pears.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:30] Street | I saw that the pine was easy to remove, and inside was granular fruit flesh, which tasted good but looked mushy. I thought of the mouse flattened by a car on the road, and it took away my appetite completely.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:35] Street | I thought of saying that just to test Lina, I hoped she would pass over the rowan berries and say, \"Take them!\"\n[1954-05-15 18:50:40] Street | I thought that if she could give me the things Enzo had given her, I would be even happier than if I had received something of her own.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:45] Lina's window side | I saw it, but she didn't give it to me. I still remember she took those rowan berries home and personally nailed a nail to the window.\n[1954-05-15 18:50:50] Lina's window side | I saw her hang the rowan berries on it. I felt as if I had been betrayed.",

    "text": "[1954-05-15 18:50:55] School | I knew Enzo hadn't sent Lina any other gifts.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:00] School | I knew Girolama had made Enzo's proposal public, and after their argument, Enzo hardly ever showed up anymore.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:05] School | I knew that although he was very good at mental arithmetic, he didn't want to study, so the teacher didn't recommend him to take the entrance exam for middle school. I thought he didn't feel sorry at all, but instead felt happy.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:10] School/Market | I knew he had enrolled in a technical school, but in reality, he spent every day helping his parents with their work.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:15] School/Market | I know he got up very early in the morning, going to the vegetable market with his father, or pulling a cart loaded with vegetables from the fields to sell. His school life came to an end soon.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:20] School | I saw the teacher say that we were promising students, capable of continuing our studies. I knew it at the end of fifth grade.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:25] School | I saw the teacher calling my parents, Giggia, and Lina's parents one after another to school. I heard that they told them we must continue our studies, and in addition to the primary school graduation exam, we also had to take the entrance exam for middle school.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:30] Home | I saw how I had gone to great lengths to have my father, not my mother, meet with the teacher at school.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:35] Home | I know my mother limps and has a squint, and most of all, she's always angry; while my father, as the gatekeeper for the city government, knows how to use polite words.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:40] Home | I saw that it was my mother who went later. She talked to the teacher, and when she came home, her expression was very gloomy. I thought, but all my calculations had failed.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:45] Home | \"I heard her say, 'The teacher wants money. She said the exam is difficult, and the kids need tutoring.'\" \"What's the point of taking these exams?\" my father asked.\n[1954-05-15 18:51:50] Home | I heard, \"Let her study Latin.\" \"Why?\" \"Because the teacher said she's good at it.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:51:55] Home | I heard, \"If she's learning well, why take these paid classes?\" \"In that case, her life will be easier, but ours will be harder...\"\n[1954-05-15 18:52:00] Home | I saw them discussing for a long time. At first, my mother opposed it, while my father wasn't very sure.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:05] Home | I saw that later, my father became very careful and began to support my schooling, while my mother made some concessions, no longer opposing it as strongly as before.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:10] Home | I saw that in the end they decided to let me take the exam, but with a clear understanding that if I wasn't especially outstanding, I would have to drop out immediately.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:15] Lina's house | I saw that Lina's parents had decided not to let her continue school. I know that her mother Nunzia wasn't very sure, and she wanted to convince Lina's father.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:20] Lina's house | I saw it, but he didn't even leave room for discussion, and he slapped Rino in the face because Rino said it was wrong.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:25] School | I saw that Lina's parents didn't even want to talk to the teacher, but later the principal called them, and Nunzia had to go.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:30] School | I saw the woman, her face full of terror, reject Oliviero's proposal. I thought the teacher was a bit upset, but I still tried to remain calm.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:35] School | I saw the teacher take out Lina's excellent essay, the difficult arithmetic problems she had solved, even her classroom drawings.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:40] School | I knew that no matter what Lina painted, the girls in the class loved it, and she skillfully imitated Giotto's style.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:45] School | I know the princesses she wrote about are very realistic: their hair, jewelry, clothes, and shoes are things you can't see in books or in the parish cinema.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:50] School | After her proposal was completely rejected, Teacher Oliviero lost her patience and pulled Lina's mother to the principal. I thought of her as if she were a student who didn't follow the rules.\n[1954-05-15 18:52:55] School | I saw that Nunzia couldn't give in because she hadn't gotten her husband's permission. She kept saying \"no\" until she, the teacher, and the principal were all exhausted.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:00] School | I heard that the next day, when we went to school, Lina said to me in her usual tone: \"Either way, I'm going to take the exam.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:53:05] School | I thought about how I believed what she said, and that forbidding her to do anything was pointless, we all knew that.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:10] School | I thought she seemed stronger than all of us girls, stronger than Enzo, Alfonso Carracci, Stefano, and even her brother Rino.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:15] School | I thought she was stronger than our parents, our teachers, and even the soldiers who could have sent us to prison.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:20] School | I know that despite her fragile appearance. I thought of it, but any prohibition would lose its power in front of her.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:25] School | I thought she knew how to cross the line, but without truly facing the consequences, and in the end, people would give in.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:30] School | I thought that, despite their reluctance, people still had to admire her.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:35] Corridor | I knew going to Don Achille's house was forbidden, but she still decided to go, and I followed her.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:40] Corridor | I thought it was then, and I believed nothing could stop her; every time she went against the norm, there was always an astonishing result.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:45] Corridor | I thought about how we wanted Don Achille to return the doll to us.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:50] Corridor | I saw us walking up the stairs. I thought that with every step up the stairs, I had the urge to turn back and run back to the courtyard.\n[1954-05-15 18:53:55] Corridor | I saw and felt Lina tightly holding my hand, and I thought with relief: she was doing that because she figured I didn't have the courage to walk all the way to the top floor.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:00] Corridor | I thought of that, and she boosted her own courage by holding my hand.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:05] Corridor | I saw it that way, so we walked forward side by side. I was on the side next to the wall, and she was on the side with the railing, our hands tightly clasped. I saw and felt my hands were sweaty.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:10] Staircase | I saw us climbing the last flight of stairs and arriving at Don Achille's front door. I thought my heart was beating very hard.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:15] In front of Don Achille's house | I could hear my own heartbeat from my ears. I thought of it, but I consoled myself by thinking it might be Lina's heartbeat.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:20] In front of Don Achille's house | I heard a sound coming from the house. I thought it might be Alfonso Carracci, Stefano, or Pinocchia's voice.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:25] At the front door of Don Achille's house | I saw Lina standing silently at the door for a long time before finally ringing the bell.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:30] In front of Don Achille's house | I had been waiting for a long time with no sign of movement, and then we heard the sound of slippers — it was Maria who opened the door for us. I saw her wearing a faded green housecoat.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:35] At Don Achille's front door | I saw her speaking, and I saw her golden teeth shining brightly.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:40] At Don Achille's front door | I was surprised, thinking that we were looking for Alfonso Carracci.\n[1954-05-15 18:54:45] At Don Achille's front door | I heard Lina speaking in the dialect: \"No, we're looking for Don Achille...\" \"Speak up, what is it?\" \"We need to tell him...\"",

He was tall in the upper body but short in the lower part, with long arms that reached to his knees.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:00] At Don Achille's front door | I saw him with a cigarette in his mouth, burning, and he asked roughly. \"I heard 'Who is it?' 'The cobbler's daughter, and also the daughter of Grego...'\"\n[1954-05-15 18:55:05] At Don Achille's house door | I saw Don Achille come into the light. I thought this was the first time we had clearly seen him.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:10] At Don Achille's house door | I saw that he had no ore on him, nor any shiny glass fragments. His face was flesh-and-blood, long and narrow, with hair hanging over his ears and a bare spot in the middle of his head.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:15] At Don Achille's house door | I saw his eyes were bright, with bloodshot veins, his mouth was large, his lips thin, his chin long, with a hollow in the middle.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:20] At Don Achille's house door | I thought he was ugly, but not as ugly as I had imagined.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:25] At Don Achille's house door | \"I'll say it.\" \"About the doll.\" Lina said. \"What doll?\" \"Our doll.\" \"There's no doll of yours here...\"\n[1954-05-15 18:55:30] At Don Achille's house door | I heard, \"You took our doll from the cellar.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:55:35] At Don Achille's front door | I saw Don Achille turn his head and shout something into the house. I heard, \"Pinocchio, did you take the shoemaker's daughter's doll?\" \"I didn't.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:55:40] At Don Achille's house door | I saw \"Alfonso Carracci, did you take it?\" and a wave of laughter came from somewhere.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:45] At Don Achille's house door | I saw Lina saying very firmly. I heard, \"The doll was taken by you, we saw it.\" I thought about how I didn't know where Lina got her courage.\n[1954-05-15 18:55:50] At Don Achille's house door | I saw that, and he fell silent for a moment before asking. I heard, \"You said I took it?\" \"Yes, you put the doll in your black bag.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:55:55] At Don Achille's house door | I saw the man frown when he heard those last words. I saw and felt that he was getting annoyed.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:00] At Don Achille's front door | I couldn't believe my eyes; we just stood there, facing Don Achille, and Lina spoke to him that way.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:05] At Don Achille's house door | I saw him looking at Lina uneasily. I saw that we could barely make out Alfonso Carracci, Stefano, and Pinocchia behind him, and Maria was setting the table with dishes.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:10] At Don Achille's house door | I saw him, he was a bit short, a bit balding, and his limbs weren't very proportionate. I thought I couldn't believe he was just an ordinary man, so I was always on guard, watching for him to change.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:15] At Don Achille's house door | I saw Don Achille repeat Lina's words. I heard, \"I took your doll, I put the doll in the black bag?\" I thought he just didn't understand what that sentence meant.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:20] At Don Achille's house door | I thought I felt that he wasn't angry, but suddenly became very painful, as if confirming something he had already known.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:25] At Don Achille's house door | I saw him say something in the local dialect, but I didn't understand it. At that moment, Maria called out. I heard, \"Achille, the food is ready.\" \"I'm coming right away.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:56:30] At Don Achille's front door | I saw Don Achille reach his big hand into the pocket behind his butt. I thought about how our hands were tightly clasped, and I felt sure he was about to pull out a knife.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:35] At Don Achille's house door | I saw him take out a wallet, open it, glance inside, and then give some money to Lina. I thought to myself that I couldn't remember how many there were.\n[1954-05-15 18:56:40] At Don Achille's house door | I saw him say it. I heard, \"Take it, go buy a doll with it.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:56:45] At Don Achille's house door | I saw Lina grab the money and pull me down the stairs. She leaned out over the railing and shouted something. I heard, \"You must remember, the doll was a gift from me.\"\n[1954-05-15 18:56:50] Stairs | I kept one hand on the railing to prevent myself from falling down the stairs, and with the other, I replied in Italian. I heard, \"Enjoy your meal! Good night!\"\n[1954-06-10 09:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that before the primary school graduation exam, Lina persuaded me to do something. I thought of something I'd never had the courage to do alone: we decided to skip school and leave the place where we lived, Mergellina.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:05] Mergellina | I knew this had never happened before, ever since I could remember, I had never been away from the five-story white building where I lived.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:10] Mergellina | I knew I had never left the courtyard, the church, and the small garden, and I had never thought of leaving this Mergellina.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:15] Mergellina | I saw trains passing by here constantly, as well as many cars and trucks moving along the main road. I thought about it in my memory, and I realized I had never asked my father or my teacher where these cars, trucks, and trains were going.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:20] Mergellina | I saw that Lina also didn't show much interest in the outside world, but that trip was her idea.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:25] Mergellina | I saw her and she told me to tell my mother that all the girls would go to the teacher's house after school for the final party.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:30] Mergellina | I heard her say that even though I had warned her, the teacher had never invited all the girls to her house for any party, and she said exactly because of that, we had to say it that way.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:35] Mergellina | I know our parents wouldn't have the nerve to ask the school if it was true. I thought this matter was particularly special.\n[1954-06-10 09:00:40] Home | I said to my family as she taught me, and everyone believed it—not just my father and younger brother, but even my mother did. I thought about how, as usual, I had believed her words.\n[1954-06-10 23:00:00] Home | I thought about the night before the trip, when I couldn't sleep from excitement. What was outside this Mergellina? What awaited me beyond this familiar area?\n[1954-06-10 23:05:00] Mergellina | I saw a small hill behind us, covered with many trees, a few scattered buildings, and shining railway tracks.\n[1954-06-10 23:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that ahead of us, on the other side of the main road, there was a path running along the pond, bumpy and uneven.\n[1954-06-10 23:15:00] Mergellina | I saw the exit from the residential area, and under the vast sky, to the right was an endless expanse of farmland with no trees in sight; to the left was a Mercato, with three exits.\n[1954-06-10 23:20:00] Mergellina | When the weather is good, if we keep walking all the way to the railway tracks, we can see Mount Vesuvius, a volcano, a blue mountain with two peaks, one higher than the other.\n[1954-06-11 06:00:00] Traveling | I thought about the scene we were about to see, which would be different from everything we saw every day under our eyes, and this made us very excited.\n[1954-06-11 06:05:00] Traveling | I know that the school textbooks usually describe in detail things we have never seen. I thought about it and we were both excited.\n[1954-06-11 06:10:00] Traveling | I heard Lina say that there was a sea in the direction of Mount Vesuvius. I know Rino has been to that place. He said the sea there is blue, glittering, and very beautiful.\n[1954-06-11 06:15:00] Traveling | I know, especially on summer weekends, and it's just as beautiful in winter too. He went there to swim with his friends, and he promised to take her there once.\n[1954-06-11 06:20:00] Traveling | I know, of course, that Rino wasn't the only one who had seen the sea; there were others we knew who had seen it too.\n[1954-06-11 06:25:00] Traveling | I remember once when Nino and his sister Pinocchia mentioned the sea. For them, it was an ordinary thing; they would go to the beach now and then to eat oysters and other seafood.\n[1954-06-11 06:30:00] Traveling | I know that Giggia Spagnuolo also went there. I thought that Giugliano, Nino, and Pinochia were lucky children because their parents took them for walks to faraway places.\n[1954-06-11 06:35:00] Traveling | I know our parents are different; they don't have the time, the money, or the will.\n[1954-06-11 06:40:00] Traveling | I thought I seemed to remember the blue of the sea. My mother said she took me when I was young, to the beach for sand baths to treat her leg, which had some problem.\n[1954-06-11 06:45:00] Traveling | I thought about it, but I didn't really believe what my mother said.\n[1954-06-11 06:50:00] Traveling | I saw her planning to go to the sea like Rino, and she decided to go alone. She convinced me to go with her, and we left the next day. I heard Lina say she had never seen the sea and didn't know what it looked like, and I said I didn't know either.",

    "text": "[1954-06-11 07:00:00] Home | I saw myself getting up very early, getting everything ready, just like I was going to school.\n[1954-06-11 07:15:00] Home | I saw myself soaking the bread in hot milk, with my backpack and apron on.\n[1954-06-11 07:30:00] Gate entrance | I saw myself waiting at the gate for Lina as usual, but instead of turning right as we normally did, we crossed the road and went left toward Mercato.\n[1954-06-11 07:40:00] Outdoors | I saw that although it was morning, the weather was already very hot. Under the sun, there was a strong scent of grass and earth.\n[1954-06-11 07:45:00] Outdoors | I saw us walking through the tall hedges, taking the unfamiliar paths toward the tracks.\n[1954-06-11 07:50:00] Next to the electric pole | I saw us reach a utility pole, where we took off the aprons we wore to school and put them in our backpacks, then hid the backpacks in the bushes.\n[1954-06-11 07:55:00] Field | I saw us walking into the fields, excitedly running down a slope that led to a more secluded spot at Mercato. I thought about how familiar we were with that field.\n[1954-06-11 08:00:00] Porto | I saw us holding hands as we walked in. I saw that the entrance to Mercato was very dark, we had never gone inside before.\n[1954-06-11 08:05:00] Inside Mercato | I saw that it was a long corridor, and the light at the exit seemed very far away from us.\n[1954-06-11 08:10:00] Inside Mercato | I saw later, our eyes became accustomed to the darkness of Mercato. I saw that we could hear our own footsteps, very loud.\n[1954-06-11 08:15:00] Inside Mercato | I saw that we were moving very carefully. I saw streams of water running down the Mercato wall, sparkling, and there was a large puddle on the ground.\n[1954-06-11 08:20:00] Inside Mercato | I saw that, and Lina screamed, then started laughing. I heard her voice as if it had exploded, echoing loudly.\n[1954-06-11 08:25:00] Inside Mercato | I saw it too, and I shouted as well, then started laughing.\n[1954-06-11 08:30:00] Inside Mercato | I saw that on this stretch of road, we kept shouting, sometimes together, sometimes each of us shouting alone: laughing and shouting, shouting and laughing.\n[1954-06-11 08:35:00] Inside Mercato | I thought about how we were glad to hear the echoes of our own shouts, and our tense feelings eased; we began our journey.\n[1954-06-11 08:40:00] Main Road | I thought about the time we had, during which neither of our families would come looking for us.\n[1954-06-11 08:45:00] Main Road | I think of this day's beginning whenever I think of the beauty of freedom.\n[1954-06-11 08:50:00] Main Road | I saw that when we emerged from Mercato, we were facing a straight, endless road. I knew that Rino had told Lina that, once we finished walking this road, we would reach the sea.\n[1954-06-11 08:55:00] Main Road | I thought about how my heart was filled with the joy of entering an unknown world, which felt completely different from when I went down to the basement or climbed the stairs to Don Achille's house.\n[1954-06-11 09:00:00] Main Road | I saw that day had clouds, the sun wasn't too harsh, and I could smell a burnt smell.\n[1954-06-11 09:30:00] Main Road | I saw us walking forward along a collapsed wall, overgrown with wild grass, with some low houses lining the road. I saw that we heard someone speaking in a dialect, and sometimes we could also hear the sound of a horn.\n[1954-06-11 09:40:00] Main Road | I saw a horse neighing as it ran down from the roadside, crossing the street.\n[1954-06-11 09:50:00] Main Road | I saw a young woman combing her hair with a louse comb, removing lice from her hair.\n[1954-06-11 10:00:00] Main Road | I saw a group of children with runny noses playing by the road. When they saw us, they stopped and looked at us menacingly.\n[1954-06-11 10:10:00] Main Road | I saw a fat man, wearing a vest, come out of a dilapidated yard, unzipped his pants, and showed us his penis. I thought, but we weren't afraid at all.\n[1954-06-11 10:15:00] Main Road | I knew that Enzo's father, Don Nicola, sometimes let us touch his horse; the children in our courtyard were also fierce.\n[1954-06-11 10:20:00] Main Road | I know there's that old bastard Dona Mimi. Every time we come back from school, he shows off his disgusting thing right in front of us.\n[1954-06-11 11:30:00] Main Road | I saw that we had been walking on that main road for at least three hours. I thought the things I saw and what we face every day in reality didn't differ much.\n[1954-06-11 11:35:00] Main Road | I thought I felt that leading the way was not my responsibility.\n[1954-06-11 11:40:00] Main Road | I see us holding hands, walking side by side forward. I thought, but to me, it was as if Lina was ten steps ahead of me; she clearly knew what to do and where to go.\n[1954-06-11 11:45:00] Main Road | I thought about how I had become accustomed to following her, and I was certain she was stronger than me, just as she was in other ways.\n[1954-06-11 11:50:00] Main Road | I thought about how she knew the way, the time it would take to go and return, and the distance to the sea.\n[1954-06-11 11:55:00] Main Road | I thought she had already calculated everything in her mind, and the world around her would never disrupt her plans.\n[1954-06-11 12:00:00] Main Road | I saw a memory of a faint light, as if it came from deep within the earth, not from the sky. But on the surface, this light was a poor, dirty one. I thought about how I was lost in my own happiness.\n[1954-06-11 12:10:00] Main Road | I saw that later, we were tired, hungry, and thirsty, Lina slowed down, and so did I. I thought this was something we hadn't expected.\n[1954-06-11 12:15:00] Main Road | I remember once or twice, I realized that she seemed to regret having me do that.\n[1954-06-11 12:20:00] Main Road | I saw that she kept looking back, so I looked back too. What happened?\n[1954-06-11 12:25:00] Main Road | I saw her hands start to sweat. We had been away from Mercato for a long time, and it was no longer visible. It was the boundary of our Mergellina.\n[1954-06-11 12:30:00] Main Road | I see now, and the road before me has become very unfamiliar, stretching forward endlessly.\n[1954-06-11 12:35:00] Main Road | I saw everything around me turn desolate: discarded broken buckets, burnt wood, the skeleton of a car, wheels with broken spokes, ruined furniture, and rusted iron objects.\n[1954-06-11 12:40:00] Main Street | I thought people seemed indifferent to our fate. Why was Lina looking around? Why wasn't she speaking anymore? Was something wrong?\n[1954-06-11 12:45:00] Main Road | I looked around carefully, taking a close look. I saw the sky was once very high and distant, but now it seems a bit gloomy.\n[1954-06-11 12:50:00] Main Road | I saw that behind us had turned dark and oppressive, with thick, heavy clouds in the sky, as if supported by trees and streetlights.\n[1954-06-11 12:55:00] Main Road | I saw that ahead of us, the bright daylight still remained, but that purple darkness seemed to swallow the light. I could hear the distant sound of thunder.\n[1954-06-11 13:00:00] Main Road | I thought about how scared I was, but what frightened me most was Lina's expression—I had never seen her look like that before.\n[1954-06-11 13:05:00] Main Road | I saw her mouth open, her eyes wide with anxiety, looking left and right, forward and back. She was holding my hand tighter and tighter.\n[1954-06-11 13:10:00] Main Road | I thought to myself, could it be that she was also afraid? What had happened?\n[1954-06-11 13:15:00] Main Road | I saw the sky begin to rain, the droplets falling on the dust of the main road, leaving behind dark brown spots.\n[1954-06-11 13:20:00] Main Road | \"I heard 'Let's go back.' \" Lina said. \"What about the sea?\" \"It's too far.\" \"What about home?\" \"It's also far.\"\n[1954-06-11 13:25:00] Main Road | I heard, \"Then let's go see the sea.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\"\n[1954-06-11 13:30:00] Main Road | I saw something that made her hesitate to speak, unable to decide whether to tell me. She pulled me home. I thought to myself that I had never seen her so anxious before.\n[1954-06-11 13:35:00] Main Road | I thought to myself: I don't understand—why don't we keep going? We still have time, the sea should already be near.\n[1954-06-11 13:40:00] Main Road | I thought that if it were to rain, whether we went forward or went home, we would both get wet anyway.\n[1954-06-11 13:45:00] Main Road | I thought of this way of analyzing problems, which I had learned from her, and I was surprised she didn't think that way.\n[1954-06-11 13:50:00] Main Road | I saw a purple flash split the black sky, and the thunder grew louder. Lina pulled me, and I ran uncertainly toward our Mergellina.\n[1954-06-11 13:55:00] Main Road | I saw the wind rising, and the raindrops grew denser and denser, turning into a downpour within seconds.\n[1954-06-11 14:00:00] Main Road | I saw that neither of us had thought to find a place to take shelter from the rain, but instead we ran aimlessly in the downpour, our clothes already soaked through.\n[1954-06-11 14:05:00] Main Road | I saw us running so hard that we couldn't catch our breath. I saw us barefoot, wearing old shoes, our feet already muddy and slippery.\n[1954-06-11 14:15:00] Main Road | I saw that later, when we could no longer run, we slowed down. I saw lightning flashing and thunder roaring, with rain flowing along both sides of the road.\n[1954-06-11 14:20:00] Main Road | I saw the truck speeding by, making a loud noise and kicking up splashes of mud.\n[1954-06-11 14:25:00] Main Road | I saw that we were moving quickly. I thought about how restless our hearts were.\n[1954-06-11 14:40:00] Main Road | I saw that day, first a downpour, then light rain, and then the rain stopped, leaving the sky gray.\n[1954-06-11 14:50:00] Main Road | I saw us, drenched from head to toe, our hair clinging to our foreheads, our lips blue with cold, our eyes filled with terror.\n[1954-06-11 15:00:00] Shrubbery | I saw us passing by Mercato again, climbing the hill. I saw the rain-soaked bushes brush against our bodies, making us shiver all over.\n[1954-06-11 15:10:00] Shrubbery | I saw that we had found the backpack, and we put the dry apron over our wet clothes as we walked home.\n[1954-06-11 15:20:00] The Road Home | I saw that our eyes were fixed on the ground, and Lina didn't take my hand. I saw that the atmosphere had become tense.",

    "text": "[1954-06-11 15:30:00] Near my home | I thought about how we quickly realized everything had gone beyond our plans.\n[1954-06-11 15:35:00] School | I saw my mother coming to the school with an umbrella, wanting to take me to the teacher's party. I saw that when school was dismissed, the clouds were dense.\n[1954-06-11 15:40:00] School | I saw her realize I wasn't at school and there was no party, and she spent several hours looking for me.\n[1954-06-11 15:45:00] Near my home | I saw her distant, limping figure and immediately ran away from Lina, heading toward my mother. I thought to myself that I hoped my mother wouldn't blame Lina.\n[1954-06-11 15:50:00] Near my home | I didn't even have a chance to speak before I was slapped across the face, and my mother also hit me with her umbrella.\n[1954-06-11 15:55:00] Near my home | I saw her shouting loudly. I heard that if something like this happens again, she'll definitely kill me.\n[1954-06-11 16:00:00] Near my home | I knew Lina didn't care, because no one in her family had found out.\n[1954-06-11 20:00:00] Home | I saw that at night, my mother told my father what had happened and asked him to discipline me.\n[1954-06-11 20:30:00] Home | I saw them arguing in the end. First, my father slapped my mother, then he got angry with himself and beat me up. I thought my father was annoyed, but he didn't want to hit me.\n[1954-06-11 23:00:00] Home | I thought about the whole night, trying to figure out exactly what had happened: we had intended to go to the sea, but we didn't make it, and I ended up getting beaten for no reason.\n[1954-06-11 23:10:00] Home | I thought about how our attitude later underwent a miraculous change: even though it had started to rain, I still wanted to keep walking, feeling as if I had left everyone and everything behind, heading for a distant place.\n[1954-06-11 23:20:00] Home | I thought this was the first thing I had ever discovered, and it made me forget all my worries.\n[1954-06-11 23:30:00] Home | I thought she would go through with it, but Lina changed her mind. That was her plan—after the rain, she gave up on the sea and decided to return to the Mergellina where we lived. I found it hard to understand.\n[1954-06-12 08:00:00] School | I saw that the next day, I didn't wait for her at the community entrance, but went to school alone.\n[1954-06-12 08:30:00] Small Garden | I saw us meeting in the small garden. She saw the bruise on my arm and asked me what had happened. I heard myself shrug and say, \"They hit you?\" \"What else could they do?\" I thought it was pointless to say anything now.\n[1954-06-12 08:35:00] Small Garden | I saw her, and I looked at her with great unease. I heard, \"They still make you take Latin class?\"\n[1954-06-12 08:40:00] Small Garden | What if she wanted me to be punished by my parents, not allowed to go to high school, even though I was secretly hoping for that?\n[1954-06-12 08:45:00] Small Garden | I thought, or rather, she hurriedly brought me back in order to prevent me from being punished?\n[1954-06-12 08:50:00] Small Garden | I thought, or rather—today I'm thinking—maybe she considered both outcomes at different times?\n[1954-06-20 09:00:00] School | I saw us taking the primary school graduation exam together.\n[1954-06-20 09:30:00] School | I thought about how Lina would immediately lose her enthusiasm when she found out I was still taking the middle school entrance exam.\n[1954-06-30 09:00:00] School | I knew that at this moment, something astonishing happened to everyone: in these two exams, I got a perfect score of ten in all my subjects; while Lina's primary school graduation exam, other subjects were all nine, and she got eight in arithmetic.\n[1954-07-01 10:00:00] Street | I saw that she didn't say anything to me about her dissatisfaction or anger, but she started spending a lot of time with Camilla Peluso. I thought, as if for her, having me as a friend wasn't enough.\n[1954-07-01 10:30:00] Street | I saw us quickly forming a three-person group. I know that in this group, I was first in school exams; but when the three of us were together, my position was at the back, almost always third.\n[1954-07-01 10:45:00] Street | I saw the two of them talking, joking around. To be precise, it was Lina doing the talking and joking, while Carmela listened with great interest.\n[1954-07-01 11:00:00] Street | When we walked between the church and the main road, Lina always walked in the middle, with us on either side.\n[1954-07-01 11:15:00] Street | I thought that if I noticed Lina getting closer to Carmela, I would feel terrible and want to go home right away.\n[1954-07-10 14:00:00] By the Fountain | In the final stage, Lina looked bewildered, as if she had a heatstroke, and we occasionally sprayed water from the fountain to wet our hair. I saw that the weather was hot.\n[1954-07-10 14:15:00] By the Fountain | I saw her continuously talking about the fact that we would go to high school together the next year. I saw that I remembered her hair was wet, and her face was all wet.\n[1954-07-10 14:20:00] By the Fountain | I thought that was her favorite topic to talk about; when she spoke of it, she seemed to be talking about writing a book and making money.\n[1954-07-10 14:25:00] By the Fountain | I noticed that when she talked about middle school, she was usually speaking to Camilla Peluso. I know that Camilla got seven in all her subjects at the primary school graduation exam, and she didn't take the entrance exam for middle school.\n[1954-07-10 14:30:00] By the fountain | I thought about Lina, who was especially good at speaking, as if everything was real: our future school and teachers.\n[1954-07-10 14:35:00] By the Fountain | I found it amusing, but it also made me very worried.\n[1954-07-10 14:40:00] By the Fountain | I saw one morning that I interrupted her. I heard, \"Lina, you can't go to middle school, you didn't take the exam. Neither you nor Peluso will be going to middle school.\"\n[1954-07-10 14:45:00] By the Fountain | I saw she was angry, and she said she would go regardless of whether she took the exam or not. I heard, \"Is Camilla going too?\" \"She is.\" \"Impossible.\" \"Just wait and see!\"\n[1954-07-10 15:00:00] Home | I saw that from then on, she stopped talking about us going to school together, and became silent. I thought my words might have shocked her.\n[1954-07-15 10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that in the end she suddenly made up her mind again, and began to hassle her family, saying she wanted to learn Latin, just like me and Giggia Spagnuolo.\n[1954-07-15 10:15:00] Lina's house | I thought about how angry I was at her, especially for being angry with Rino, because he had promised to help her but hadn't.\n[1954-07-15 10:30:00] Lina's house | I knew it was useless to say anything to her; she had become unreasonable and stubborn.\n[1954-07-20 10:00:00] Street | I saw that summer had come, and she began to treat me with a very hard-to-define attitude. I thought I could see how anxious she was, as aggressive as ever, and I was glad because I understood her.\n[1954-07-20 10:05:00] Street | I thought, and I also felt, that behind her usual way of doing things lay a pain that troubled me deeply.\n[1954-07-20 10:10:00] Street | I thought about how she was suffering, and I didn't like to see her suffer.\n[1954-07-20 10:15:00] Street | I thought about how I preferred that other her, the one who wouldn't have anxiety, the Lina who was different from me.\n[1954-07-20 10:20:00] Street | I thought about how I had discovered her weakness, and it made me feel uncomfortable. This discomfort secretly turned into a sense of superiority.\n[1954-07-20 10:25:00] Street | I would carefully remind her whenever there was an opportunity, especially when Camilla Peluso wasn't with us, that my grades were better than hers and that I was going to middle school while she wasn't.\n[1954-07-20 10:30:00] Street | I saw that I was no longer following her, but had overtaken her. I thought to myself that this was my first real success in life.\n[1954-07-20 10:35:00] Street | I realized I could sense that she had become even more harsh, not just with me, but with her own family as well.",

    "text": "[1954-07-25 18:00:00] Courtyard | I sometimes wait in the courtyard for her, and hear her cries coming from the window.\n[1954-07-25 18:05:00] Courtyard | I saw her cursing, more offensive and hurtful than street insults. I heard her cursing like that, and I thought about rules and respect. I felt she shouldn't have spoken to adults that way, including her brother.\n[1954-07-25 18:10:00] Lina's house | I knew her father Fernando had only five minutes of patience, after which he would lose his temper, just like other fathers.\n[1954-07-25 18:15:00] Lina's house | I know that if Lina doesn't provoke him, he's a warm and polite man, a remarkable shoemaker.\n[1954-07-25 18:20:00] Lina's house | I know he looked like an American actor named Randolph Scott, but he wasn't refined at all, much rougher than that actor, and he wouldn't wear light-colored clothes.\n[1954-07-25 18:25:00] Lina's house | I know he had a thick beard, black hair that grew down to below his eyes; his hands were large and wide, and his fingernails were full of black dirt.\n[1954-07-25 18:30:00] Lina's house | I know he loves to joke around. Sometimes when I went to Lina's house, he would pinch my nose with his index and middle finger, pretending to pull it off. I thought about how he wanted me to believe he had stolen my nose, which was struggling in his hand, trying to get back onto my face. I found it very amusing.\n[1954-07-25 18:35:00] Lina's House | I know, but if Rino, Lina, or another child made him angry, you could hear his roar from the street. I thought about it, and it also made me very afraid.\n[1954-07-30 18:00:00] Under Lina's window | I saw one afternoon, something happened, and Lina didn't show up that time. I called her from the window, since their family lived on the first floor. I know that in the hot season, we would stay outside until dinner time.\n[1954-07-30 18:05:00] Under Lina's window | I saw myself shouting, \"Lina! Li! Li!\" I heard my voice merge with Fernando's and his wife's screams, interwoven with my friend Lina's stubborn cries.\n[1954-07-30 18:10:00] Under Lina's window | I heard the heart-wrenching Mask Loc 001 dialect coming from the window, along with the sound of something breaking. I thought I heard it very clearly—I was experiencing something I was terribly afraid of.\n[1954-07-30 18:15:00] Under Lina's window | It occurred to me that, on the surface, this was no different from the arguments that happened in our family. My mother was angry because there wasn't enough money, and my father was furious because my mother had already spent most of his salary.\n[1954-07-30 18:20:00] Under Lina's window | I know that when my father gets angry, he controls himself. It's a silent fury; he suppresses his voice, even though his neck veins bulge and his eyes turn red.\n[1954-07-30 18:25:00] Under Lina's window | I know Fernando would shout loudly, throw things, and his anger would keep getting worse, never stopping. If his wife tried to stop him, it would only make him angrier, and he might even hit her, even though she had nothing to do with it.\n[1954-07-30 18:30:00] Under Lina's window | I thought that, in reality, their arguments were essentially no different from ours.\n[1954-07-30 18:35:00] Under Lina's window | I saw that I was still calling her Lina. I thought of wanting to pull her out of that storm of shouting, cursing, and destruction.\n[1954-07-30 18:40:00] Under Lina's window | I shouted: Lina! Lina! But she didn't hear me, still arguing with her father.\n[1954-07-30 18:45:00] Under Lina's window | I know we were ten years old then, almost turning eleven. I was getting steadily rounder, while Lina remained small, very thin and delicate.\n[1954-07-30 18:50:00] Under Lina's window | I saw that suddenly, the shouting stopped. A few seconds later, I saw my friend fly out of the window.\n[1954-07-30 18:55:00] Under Lina's window | I saw her pass over my head and land on the ground behind me.\n[1954-07-30 19:00:00] Under Lina's window | I saw it and was instantly stunned.\n[1954-07-30 19:05:00] Under Lina's window | I saw Fernando stick his head out the window and continue to curse his daughter, how he had thrown Lina out like a piece of trash.\n[1954-07-30 19:10:00] Under Lina's window | I saw myself looking at her with fear, and she tried to stand up.\n[1954-07-30 19:15:00] Under Lina's window | I saw her make a near-laughing face. I heard, \"I'm fine.\"\n[1954-07-30 19:20:00] Under Lina's window | I saw her bleeding, her arm had broken.\n[1954-08-05 10:00:00] Street | I know that a father can punish his disobedient daughter any way he wants.\n[1954-08-05 10:30:00] At the shoe shop door | I knew that after that incident, Fernando became more gloomy, working even harder than usual.\n[1954-08-05 11:00:00] Shoe shop door | I saw that throughout the summer, sometimes I, Carmela, and Lina would pass by his shop, and whenever Rino saw us, he would always greet us warmly.\n[1954-08-05 11:15:00] Shoe shop door | I saw but the cobbler Fernando—his daughter's arm was still in a cast—didn't even lift his eyes. I thought he was actually quite sad, but compared to the violent incident that had happened to Mergellina, the violence he had inflicted as a father didn't amount to much.\n[1954-08-10 12:00:00] Bar | I know that in the bars of Sorrento, on hot days, men who have lost money and had too much to drink sometimes reach a desperate point and start fighting.\n[1954-08-10 12:15:00] Bar | I know that Silvio Solara is the owner of this bar. He's strong, with a big belly, blue eyes, and a high forehead.\n[1954-08-10 12:20:00] Bar | I know he has a thick black stick behind the counter, and if someone doesn't pay, or refuses to settle their debt on time, or breaks their promise, that stick will hit them without hesitation.\n[1954-08-10 12:25:00] Bar | I know that usually, his two sons—Marcello and Michele—would also come out to help him. They were about the same age as Lina's brother, but they were even harsher than their father.\n[1954-08-10 12:30:00] Community | I know that some people hit others, and some get beaten. Some men come home full of rage because they've lost money, gotten drunk, accumulated debts, couldn't pay back, got beaten, and then when their family members say something wrong, they start hitting them. It's a vicious cycle.\n[1954-08-20 14:00:00] Community | I know that during this long season, something happened that unsettled everyone, especially Lina.\n[1954-08-20 14:05:00] At Don Achille's house | I know Don Achille, the terrible Don Achille, who was killed in his own home on an unexpected rainy afternoon in August.\n[1954-08-20 14:10:00] At Don Achille's house | I knew he was in the kitchen at that moment, just having opened the window to let in the cool air after the rain. To do this, he had interrupted his afternoon nap and gotten up from the bed.\n[1954-08-20 14:15:00] At Don Achille's house | I know he was wearing a very old sky-blue pajama top, and his feet were only in yellowed socks, which had turned dark at the heels.\n[1954-08-20 14:20:00] At Don Achille's house | I knew he had just opened the window when a raindrop hit his face. At that moment, he was slashed between his neck, jaw, and collarbone.\n[1954-08-20 14:25:00] At Don Achille's house | I knew blood was spurting from his neck and splashing onto a copper pot hanging on the wall.\n[1954-08-20 14:30:00] At Don Achille's house | I knew the pot was very shiny, the blood splashed on it like ink—Lina told us—those drops of blood ran down, forming irregular black lines.\n[1954-08-20 14:35:00] At Don Achille's house | I thought Lina believed the killer was a woman, slipping silently into the house.\n[1954-08-20 14:40:00] At Don Achille's house | I thought about how the killer had used the lunchtime: the children were all outside, and the adults were either at work or resting.\n[1954-08-20 14:45:00] At Don Achille's house | I thought she must have used a fake key to open the door, intending to stab him in the heart while he was napping. But when the killer saw him wake up, she just slashed his neck.\n[1954-08-20 14:50:00] At Don Achille's house | I knew Don Achille turned away, the entire blade sinking into his neck. His eyes widened, and blood flowed from the wound, like a small stream running down his pajamas.\n[1954-08-20 14:55:00] At Don Achille's house | I knew he was kneeling on the ground, face down.",

    "text": "[1954-08-20 15:00:00] Community | I saw the murder deeply shaken Lina, and almost every day she would seriously add new details. I thought as if she had been there at that moment.\n[1954-08-20 15:05:00] Community | I saw her telling us about the murder, and both me and Camilla Peluso were terrified. I thought that even Camilla couldn't sleep at night.\n[1954-08-20 15:10:00] Community | When we reached the scariest part of the story—the blood flowing down from the copper pot—Lina's eyes would narrow into a slit, looking very fierce.\n[1954-08-20 15:15:00] Community | I thought about how she imagined the killer was a woman, which made it easier for her to get into character.\n[1954-08-25 10:00:00] The Perusso House | I remember that during that time, we often went to the Perussi house to play three-player checkers together—and Lina suddenly developed a passion for it.\n[1954-08-25 10:15:00] The Perusso family's home | I knew that Camilla's mother had brought us to the restaurant, where all the furniture had been made by her husband before Don Achille took over the carpenter's shop.\n[1954-08-25 10:30:00] The Perusso Family's Home | I saw us sitting at the table, playing checkers there. I saw the table placed between two mirror-lined cabinets.\n[1954-08-25 10:45:00] The Perusso House | I thought I was growing more and more to dislike Camilla, but I pretended to be her friend, at least when Lina was around. Sometimes I even pretended to care more about Camilla.\n[1954-08-25 11:00:00] The Perusso House | I know that as compensation, I really liked Mrs. Peluso, who worked at the cigarette factory, but during those months she was unemployed, so she was always at home.\n[1954-08-25 11:15:00] The Perusso Family's Home | I know that no matter how good or bad the days were, she was a happy woman. She was fat, with large breasts and two red patches on her cheeks that gave her a warm, lively appearance. Although our home was poor, she always managed to get us something good to eat.\n[1954-08-25 11:30:00] The Perusso House | I knew her husband was a quiet man, and at that time he worked as a waiter in a pizzeria.\n[1954-08-25 11:45:00] The Perusso family's home | I know he forced himself not to go to Capodimonte, not wanting to lose the few coins he'd worked so hard to earn.\n[1954-08-28 10:00:00] The Perusso House | I remember one morning, we were playing checkers in the Perussi family's dining room, and I was teaming up with Carmela against Lina.\n[1954-08-28 10:15:00] The Perusso House | I saw us both sitting at the table, the two of us on one side, Carmela on the other. I saw a cabinet with a mirror behind Lina, and there was an identical cabinet behind me and Carmela as well. All the cabinets were made of dark wood and had ornate edges.\n[1954-08-28 10:20:00] The Perusso Family's Home | I saw the three of us forming countless reflections in the mirror, my mind unable to focus. I thought about how I didn't like seeing so many of us in the mirror.\n[1954-08-28 10:25:00] The Perusso House | I saw that, on that day, Alfredo Peruzzo was very irritable, constantly taking his anger out on his wife.\n[1954-08-28 10:30:00] The Perusso House | I saw later someone knocking on the door, and Mrs. Peluso went to open it. I saw that followed by a burst of exclamation and shouting.\n[1954-08-28 10:35:00] The Perusso House | I saw the three of us peeking out from the restaurant, and we saw the soldiers—they were figures we all feared.\n[1954-08-28 10:40:00] The Perusso House | I saw the carabinieri seizing Alfredo and taking him away.\n[1954-08-28 10:45:00] The Perusso House | I saw him flailing his arms, shouting desperately, calling out the names of several children: Pasquale, Carmela, Ciro, and Irmacola.\n[1954-08-28 10:50:00] The Perusso House | I saw him gripping the furniture he had made himself, and the chair, and he swore to Giuseppina that he hadn't killed Don Achille, that he was innocent.\n[1954-08-28 10:55:00] The Perusso Family's Home | I saw Carmela crying desperately, everyone was crying, and I started crying too.\n[1954-08-28 11:00:00] The Perusso Family's Home | I saw that Lina wasn't crying. Her gaze was the same as the one she had given Melina years ago, but now it was more indifferent.\n[1954-08-28 11:05:00] The Perusso House | I saw her standing motionless then, as if her eyes were following Alfredo.\n[1954-08-28 11:10:00] The Perusso House | I saw Alfredo let out a hoarse cry: \"Ah! Ah!\" I saw something very frightening.\n[1954-08-28 11:15:00] The Perusso House | I thought this was the most terrifying scene we had ever seen during our childhood, and it deeply shocked me.\n[1954-08-28 11:20:00] The Perusso House | I saw Lina worrying about Carmela, and she comforted her. I heard her say to Carmela that if it was really her father who killed Don Achille, then he had done a very good job.\n[1954-08-28 11:25:00] The Perusso family's home | I heard her say she didn't think it was Peluso, he was innocent and would be released soon.\n[1954-08-28 11:30:00] The Perusso House | I saw them whispering there all along, and if I got close, they would move a bit away, not letting me hear what they were saying.\n[1954-10-20 16:00:00] via Toledo | I saw myself and Lina laughing. I watched her hang the rowan berries on the nail by the window. I heard Enzo give Lina a rowan blossom wreath. I said, \"Rowan blossoms, I like them...\" I knew that Enzo never sent gifts again after that, he went after Geyao La. I realized I was lying; I didn't like rowan berries, they made me think of dead mice. I just wanted to test whether Lina would give me the gift. She didn't, and I felt betrayed.\n[1955-06-15 18:00:00] Mergellina | I saw my mother go to the school for a meeting and return with a gloomy expression. After discussing it, my parents decided I should take the entrance exam. I heard my mother say, \"The teacher wants money... to let her study Latin.\" My father asked, \"Why take a paid class?\" I knew that by the end of fifth grade, the teacher suggested we continue studying. I thought about wanting my father to talk to her, because my mother was always angry, but my plan backfired.\n[1955-06-16 10:00:00] Chiaia | I saw Lina's parents refusing to let her continue school. I heard that Rino was physically assaulted, and Nunzia was dragged in front of the principal. I saw the teacher show Lina's essay and drawings, but Nunzia kept saying \"No.\" I know that Lina imitated Giotto's style, and the princess she painted was very realistic.\n[1955-06-17 08:00:00] Chiaia | I heard Lina say, \"No matter what, I'm going to take the exam.\" I thought about believing what she said. I felt she was stronger than everyone else, and any ban would lose its power before her; in the end, people would have to admire her.\n[1958-10-01 08:00:00] Middle School | I know that when I was in the first year of junior high school, things weren't very good either. I thought back to the beginning, when I was full of hope. Although I didn't say it out loud, I was happy to be going to middle school with Giggia instead of with Lina.\n[1958-10-01 08:05:00] Middle School | I thought of a very secret corner deep inside my heart, where I had already sensed a joy: without Lina in this school, I might become the best student, and I could show off in front of her.\n[1958-11-01 09:00:00] Middle School | I thought that once I started junior high, I would find it very difficult, because many people were better at studying than me.\n[1958-12-31 23:30:00] Roof top | I know that on December 31, 1958, she first experienced the \"loss of boundaries.\" I thought this wasn't my own wording, because Lina had always used \"the disappearance of boundaries\" to describe her feelings.\n[1958-12-31 23:30:05] Roof top | I heard her say that in such a situation, the boundary between people and things suddenly disappeared. I knew this had become her special term.\n[1958-12-31 23:45:00] Roof top | I saw that night, we were on the roof of a building, celebrating the arrival of 1959. I thought about how I realized she had suddenly experienced this feeling for the first time.\n[1958-12-31 23:45:10] Roof top | I buried the matter in my heart as soon as I saw her. I thought I saw that she was very afraid, because at that moment she didn't yet know how to describe it.",

I saw that, even though the weather was cold, what caught my eye was how we dressed lightly for beauty, our shoulders exposed.\n[1958-12-31 23:50:15] Roof of the residential area | I saw us watching those men, all of them so cheerful and strong. I thought about how, because of the holiday, they were eating delicious food, drinking sparkling wine, and acting a bit reckless.\n[1958-12-31 23:55:00] Roof of the residential area | I saw them light the firecracker fuses to celebrate the new year. I know that Lina later said she went to great lengths for this ceremony.\n[1958-12-31 23:55:10] Roof of the residential area | I saw her looking up at the fireworks shooting into the sky. I thought she was very happy.\n[1958-12-31 23:58:00] Roof of the residential area | I saw her suddenly—she later told me—start to sweat. I saw and felt that the weather was very cold.\n[1958-12-31 23:58:10] Roof of the residential area | I saw and felt that everyone's shouts were too loud, and everyone was moving too fast. I thought of it and felt a wave of nausea.\n[1958-12-31 23:58:20] Roof of the residential community | I thought of her feeling something, a very specific presence that surrounded her and others, as well as everything else, something she had never felt before.\n[1958-12-31 23:58:30] Roof of the residential community | I thought that this existence of hers was now breaking through the people and things around her, revealing its true face.\n[1958-12-31 23:58:40] Roof of the residential area | I saw her heart start to beat wildly, completely uncontrollable. I thought about how she felt completely out of control.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:00] Roof of the residential area | I saw the people moving around on the rooftop. I saw their shouts, the sound of fireworks and firecrackers, as if they came from another world, following some new and unfamiliar rules.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:10] Roof of the residential area | I thought that would make her feel afraid, feel extremely nauseated.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:20] Roof of the residential area | I thought about how our dialect made her feel alienated, how our moist throats and words soaked in saliva made her feel unbearable.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:30] Roof of the residential area | I thought of her extreme revulsion toward the moving bodies around her, their skeletons, their madness.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:40] Roof of the residential area | I thought, we developed terribly, so imperfectly: broad shoulders, arms, legs, ears, nose, and eyes—everything looked like a monster in her eyes.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:45] Roof of the residential area | I thought that they seemed to have fallen from some place in the dark sky.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:50] Roof of the residential area | I thought, God knows, that feeling of revulsion and disdain, especially directed at her brother Rino, the person she knew best and loved the most.\n[1958-12-31 23:59:55] Roof of the residential area | I saw her as if she was seeing him for the first time. I thought of him as a small, stocky animal, the loudest, most cruel, most greedy, and most foolish.\n[1959-01-01 00:00:00] Roof of the residential area | I saw her heart pounding wildly, completely uncontrollable. I thought she was going to suffocate.\n[1959-01-01 00:00:10] Roof of the residential area | I saw too many fireworks flashing in the cold night sky, with thick smoke spreading everywhere and an awful smell.\n[1959-01-01 00:00:20] Roof of the residential area | I thought of Lina trying to calm herself, saying to herself: I must control this thing that is attacking me, I have to get rid of it.\n[1959-01-01 00:00:30] Roof of the residential area | I saw it, but at that moment, amid the cheers of everyone, she felt something fly past her ear. I heard a sound like firecrackers exploding, then I heard a gunshot.\n[1959-01-01 00:00:40] Roof of the residential area | I saw that they were no longer setting off firecrackers and fireworks, but shooting guns.\n[1959-01-01 00:00:50] Roof of the residential community | I saw Rino cursing violently towards the place where yellow flames were burning. I thought of all kinds of filthy words, unbearable ones.\n[1959-01-01 00:05:00] Roof of the residential area | I thought about it, but on the night of the New Year's celebration, she felt for the first time that everything around her had become unfamiliar, that the whole world had broken through its boundaries and revealed its terrifying nature, which made her very uneasy.\n[1959-02-01 10:00:00] Home | I saw that Lina's cast had been removed from her arm. I saw a pale, thin arm sticking out; she was back to normal.\n[1959-02-01 12:00:00] Home | I saw her father Fernando come up with a way to make amends. I know, but he never told Lina directly. Instead, he conveyed it through Rino and his wife Nunzia, saying that Lina could go to school.\n[1959-02-01 12:00:10] Home | I thought about what I had forgotten to study, maybe shorthand, bookkeeping, home economics, or all three.\n[1959-02-15 09:00:00] School | I saw that she didn't want to go to school. I knew my mother Nunzia was often called to the school because Lina was frequently absent without reason.\n[1959-02-15 09:30:00] School | I saw and disrupted the class during lessons, refusing to answer questions.\n[1959-02-15 09:40:00] School | After she spent five minutes doing the necessary exercises, she would bother the other girls.\n[1959-03-01 10:00:00] Home | I saw that once, she got a bad cold. I thought she had never been sick before, and that time seemed almost careless, the virus left her listless.\n[1959-03-15 10:00:00] On the street | I watched for a long time, but she didn't get better. When she went out again, she was even paler than before. I know she had a fever again later.\n[1959-03-20 15:00:00] On the way | I saw that one day I would meet her on the road. I saw her looking like a ghost, just like the ghost of a girl who had eaten a poisoned apple, as I had seen in the fairy tale book Oliviero gave us.\n[1959-03-20 15:00:10] On the way | I know I heard that she might die soon. I thought about it, and it was really unbearable.\n[1959-04-01 10:00:00] Home | I saw it, but later she gradually got better. I thought that she almost didn't want to get better.\n[1959-05-01 10:00:00] Middle School | By the end, both I and Jiyao were trapped in a swamp-like situation, like frightened little animals. I knew my grades were very average, and throughout the whole year we struggled hard just to avoid being in the last few. It hurts me so much to even think about it.\n[1959-05-01 10:05:00] Middle School | I thought of the idea that arose from deep within my heart: without Lina, we would never make it into the top ranks.\n[1959-05-05 16:00:00] At the school gate | I sometimes meet Alfonso Carracci at the school gate. I knew he was Don Achille's son, but we pretended not to know each other.\n[1959-05-05 16:01:00] At the school gate | I thought I didn't know what to say to him. Alfredo Peluso had killed his father, and I thought that was for the best. I couldn't find any words to comfort him.\n[1959-05-05 16:02:00] At the school gate | I couldn't feel any sympathy for his orphaned situation, just like Don Achille had made me live in fear for so many years— he was also responsible.\n[1959-05-05 16:03:00] At the school gate | I saw a black mourning ribbon on his sleeve. He never smiled, always busy with his own affairs. I know he's not in my class, but I've heard he studies very well.\n[1959-05-05 16:04:00] At the school gate | I know that in our final year of elementary school, we all knew that his middle school entrance exam score was eight points. I thought I felt a lot of pressure.",

    "text": "[1959-06-01 10:00:00] School | I saw that at school, she made up excuses about not having the energy to study, and later she went there very rarely. I knew that at the end of the year, she didn't pass her exam.\n[1959-06-15 10:00:00] School | I knew that by the end of seventh grade, Geyao La had failed Latin and math, and I got six points, barely passing.\n[1959-06-20 10:00:00] School | When I saw the results posted, the teacher called my mother to the school. I heard her say to my mother, in front of me, that I passed Latin because she was kind to me, but that I wouldn't have passed second grade if I didn't take private lessons.\n[1959-06-20 10:05:00] School | I felt a double humiliation: first, because my grades were not as good as when I was in elementary school, and second, because of the shame caused by the gap between the teacher and my mother standing together.\n[1959-06-20 10:06:00] School | I saw the teacher, who looked so respectable, dressed appropriately, and her Italian was as grand as the language of the epic *Iliad*.\n[1959-06-20 10:06:10] School | I saw my mother's deformed legs, her worn-out shoes, her dull and lifeless hair, and her Italian filled with regional dialects and full of errors. I thought that must have made her feel humiliated.\n[1959-06-20 12:00:00] Home | I saw her return home, clearly angry. I heard that my father's teacher told him she was not satisfied with me, and that the family needed help, so I should drop out of school.\n[1959-06-20 12:30:00] Home | I saw them discussing for a long time, and then they started arguing. I knew that in the end, my father decided that since I had finally passed all the exams, but Giggia had failed two, I could continue going to school.\n[1959-07-15 14:00:00] Courtyard | I saw that I had spent a lazy summer. I saw her lingering in the courtyard, by the pond, usually with Giggio.\n[1959-07-15 14:10:00] Courtyard | I heard her say that a young college student had come to the house to give her lessons, and she thought the man had fallen in love with her. I felt annoyed listening to her talk endlessly about these things.\n[1959-07-20 17:00:00] On the street | I sometimes see Lina and Carmela Peluso walking outside. I know that Camilla also went to a school later, I don't know which one, and she didn't pass the exams.\n[1959-07-20 17:05:00] On the street | I thought about how I felt that Lina no longer wanted to be my friend, and this feeling made me exhausted, as if I were trapped in a deep sleep.\n[1959-07-20 17:06:00] Home | Sometimes I wish my mother couldn't see me, and I'd lie in bed dozing off.\n[1959-07-25 15:00:00] Home | I saw that one afternoon, I really fell asleep. I woke up and felt that my underwear was wet.\n[1959-07-25 15:05:00] Bathroom | I went to the bathroom to see what was happening. I saw blood all over the underwear.\n[1959-07-25 15:06:00] Bathroom | I thought, for some reason, I was terrified, afraid my mother would scold me because I had hurt myself between my legs.\n[1959-07-25 15:10:00] Bathroom | I saw myself carefully washing the underwear, wringing it out, and then putting it back on.\n[1959-07-25 15:15:00] Courtyard | I saw myself go out and arrive in the scorching courtyard. I thought about how, out of fear, my heart was pounding.\n[1959-07-25 15:20:00] Church | I saw that I had met Lina and Carmela, and I walked with them to the church.\n[1959-07-25 15:25:00] Church | I saw that I felt wet again below. I tried to comfort myself by thinking that it was because my underwear was wet.\n[1959-07-25 15:26:00] Church | I couldn't take it anymore, so I whispered in Lina's ear. I heard, \"I have something to tell you.\"\n[1959-07-25 15:26:10] Church | \"I heard 'What?' 'I just wanted to tell someone.'\"\n[1959-07-25 15:26:20] Church | I saw myself grabbing her arm and pulling her away from Carmela, but Carmela followed us.\n[1959-07-25 15:26:30] Church | I was very worried at the time, so I told both of them, my eyes on Lina.\n[1959-07-25 15:26:40] Church | \"I wondered, what could be the reason?\" I asked. I know Camilla is very familiar with it, because she's been bleeding for a year now, once a month.\n[1959-07-25 15:27:00] Church | \"I hear,\" she said, \"women are like that by nature. They bleed for a few days each month, their stomachs and lower backs hurt, but it'll pass.\"\n[1959-07-25 15:27:10] Church | I heard, \"Are you sure?\" \"Sure.\"\n[1959-07-25 15:28:00] Church | I saw Lina's silence pushing me toward Carmela. I realized I had started to like her.\n[1959-07-25 15:30:00] Church | I saw Camilla naturally tell me what she knew, and she put my mind at ease.\n[1959-07-25 18:00:00] Church | I spoke to her all afternoon, until dinner time. I thought about how I had confirmed that the wound wouldn't kill anyone.\n[1959-07-25 18:05:00] Church | I know it means more than that, it also means you've grown up and are ready to [childbearing state], provided a man puts his thing inside your belly.\n[1959-07-25 18:10:00] Church | I saw Lina listening quietly to our conversation, hardly saying a word.\n[1959-07-25 18:11:00] Church | I asked her if she was bleeding like us, and I noticed she hesitated. I heard her say, \"No,\" very unwillingly.\n[1959-07-25 18:12:00] Church | I suddenly thought, and I felt that Lina was very small, even smaller than the Lina I had always seen.\n[1959-07-25 18:12:10] Church | I saw that she was six or seven centimeters shorter than us, so thin that her bones seemed to poke through her skin. Although she spent a lot of time outdoors, she still looked very pale.\n[1959-07-25 18:12:20] Church | I knew she had failed the exam, she didn't know what it meant to bleed, and no boy had ever confessed his love to her.\n[1959-07-25 18:13:00] Church | I heard \"You'll come too.\" We both comforted her with a feigned tone.\n[1959-07-25 18:13:10] Church | \"I don't care at all,\" she said, \"I don't have it because I don't want to, it's really disgusting, and people who do that also make me sick.\"\n[1959-07-25 18:13:20] Church | I saw her turn to leave, but then she stopped and asked me. I heard, \"How about Latin?\"\n[1959-07-25 18:13:30] Church | I heard, \"It's very beautiful.\" \"Did you study well?\" \"Very well.\"\n[1959-07-25 18:14:00] Church | I saw her hesitate for a moment and mutter something. I heard, \"I failed on purpose. I don't want to go to school anymore.\"\n[1959-07-25 18:14:10] Church | \"I heard, 'What do you want to do?' 'Do what I like to do.'\"\n[1959-07-25 18:15:00] Church | I saw her finally leave us both in the courtyard and walk away.\n[1959-09-01 08:00:00] Mergellina | I know that during the years I was in high school, we watched many things change right before our eyes. I thought about it, but I felt that we were gradually caught up in it without realizing it was a real change.\n[1959-09-01 08:00:10] Sorara Capodimonte | I saw the Solara bar had expanded into a place that served all kinds of pastries. I saw that the pastry chef was the father of Giggia Spagnuolo.\n[1959-09-06 10:00:00] Sorara Capodimonte | I saw that on Sundays, Capodimonte was crowded with men of all ages, buying desserts for their families.\n[1959-09-06 10:05:00] Street | I saw the two sons of Silvio Solara—Marcello, about twenty years old, and Michele, a bit younger. They had bought a blue-and-white Fiat 1100 car.\n[1959-09-06 10:06:00] Street | I saw them driving around the streets of Mergellina on Sunday. I thought to myself that I felt they were showing off extravagantly.\n[1959-10-01 09:00:00] Karachi Capodimonte | After I saw that the shop of the former carpenter Peluso had fallen into Don Achille's hands, it had become a Capodimonte. I saw that inside was filled with delicious things, and sometimes they would even be placed on the sidewalk.\n[1959-10-01 09:05:00] Karachi Capodimonte | I saw someone passing by the door of Capodimonte. I see and I smell the spices, olives, sausages, fresh bread, and olive oil, all of which make my appetite grow.\n[1959-10-01 09:10:00] Karachi Capodimonte | I knew that after Don Achille's death, his terrible shadow gradually faded away, moving away from this place, away from his family.\n[1959-10-01 09:15:00] Karachi Capodimonte | I saw Madame Maria the widow running the Capodimonte herself, and she spoke very politely. I saw her daughter Pinocchia, who was fifteen years old, working in the store.\n[1959-10-01 09:20:00] Karachi Capodimonte | I saw my son Stefano, who was no longer that angry boy wanting to rip Lina's tongue out of her mouth. I saw her, and she became very composed, her gaze sincere, with a gentle smile.\n[1959-10-01 09:25:00] Karachi Capodimonte | I saw that their customers were increasing, and my mother often sent me to their house to buy things. I knew my father didn't object for another reason: when we had no money, Stefano would write down the debts in a small notebook, and we could settle the accounts at the end of the month.",

    "text": "[1959-11-01 08:00:00] Street | I know the woman, Assunta, who sells vegetables and fruits with her husband on the street. She has a problem with her back and has to stay at home.\n[1960-01-01T13:00:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about how Stefano seemed so kind, so deeply in love with Lina, and I couldn't believe he had given Marcello that pair of shoes Lina had painstakingly made as a child, the shoes covered in Lina's fingerprints, the ones that held all her heart and soul.\n[1960-01-01T13:05:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw that at the wedding, I had forgotten about Alfonso Carracci and Pinochia. Their eyes were shining, their faces full of life as they sat at the table talking. I didn't notice my mother's drunken laughter; the music, the singing, the dancing people—all faded into the background.\n[1960-01-01T13:06:00] Wedding ceremony site | I saw Antonio appear on the balcony, his jealousy boiling over, standing by the glass window staring at the purple city and the sea; the image of Nino, like a great angel, silently leaving the hall without a word, also gradually faded.\n[1960-01-01T13:07:00] Wedding Ceremony Site | I saw only Lina, very excited, whispering to Stefano. I saw her in her wedding dress, her face very pale. Stefano had no smile on his face; he looked extremely embarrassed. His forehead and the area above his eyes were slightly white, as if a mask had been placed over the redness of his face.\n[1960-01-01T13:08:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw my friend pull her husband's arm toward her with both hands, using a lot of strength. What happened? What else is going to happen?\n[1960-01-01T13:09:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I thought I knew her well. I felt that if she could, she would tear off his arm, raise it over her head, and run through the hall with the bleeding arm, using it like a stick or a donkey's jawbone to smash violently into Marcello's face, aiming straight for him.\n[1960-01-01T13:10:00] Wedding ceremony scene | You're right! She should have done that. The moment I think of this scene, my heart races and my throat goes dry. She should have pulled out both men's eyes, bitten them, and torn the flesh from their bones.\n[1960-01-01T13:11:00] Wedding ceremony scene | Yes, yes, I thought of that, I want to see such a scene, I hope such a thing will happen. Let their love come to an end, let this unbearable wedding be interrupted.\n[1960-01-01T13:12:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I thought of the honeymoon bed on the Amalfi beach, where there would be no more embraces, and suddenly everything in Mergellina, every event, every person, shattered. Let everything be destroyed!\n[1960-01-01T13:13:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about how I would run away with Lina to live far away, just the two of us, carrying that destructive joy, sinking deeper and deeper into those unfamiliar cities. I thought it was most appropriate for that day to end like that.\n[1960-01-01T13:14:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I thought, if nothing could save us—money couldn't, men couldn't, studies couldn't—then it would be better to destroy everything right away. Her anger burned inside me, a power that was either mine or not mine, and the pleasure of losing myself completely overwhelmed me.\n[1960-01-01T13:15:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I thought about how I wished this power could spread, but I also realized my fear of it. Later, I gradually understood that I could only silently endure my misfortune, because I lacked the ability to let my anger erupt. I was afraid of violence, frightened by those violent reactions. I preferred to remain still, letting hatred continue to grow.\n[1960-01-01T13:16:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I saw it, but Lina was not like that; when she left her seat, her movements were very decisive. She stood up. I saw the table shaking, the dishes in the dirty plate were shaking too, and a glass cup was knocked over.\n[1960-01-01T13:17:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw Stefano move somewhat mechanically; he quickly reached out to steady the glass, preventing the wine from spilling onto Signora Solara's dress.\n[1960-01-01T13:18:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw Lina hurry out through the side door, and every time her wedding dress got caught on something, she struggled to free it.\n[1960-01-01T13:19:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about chasing after her, grabbing her hand, and whispering to her: \"Leave, let's get out of here!\" But I didn't move.\n[1960-01-01T13:20:00] Wedding Ceremony Site | I saw Stefano hesitate for a moment, then push through the dancers to chase after Lina.\n[1960-01-01T13:21:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I saw myself looking around. I saw that people also realized the bride was protesting about something.\n[1960-01-01T13:22:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I saw Marcello still completely at ease, chatting with Rino as if wearing those shoes was perfectly normal. I kept thinking about the antique dealer's toast, which was getting more and more ridiculous. The guests of the lowest rank could only force smiles.\n[1960-01-01T13:23:00] Wedding Ceremony Site | I thought that no one except me had realized that the wedding just held had already ended.\n[1960-01-01T13:24:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I thought this marriage was supposed to last until the couple died, until they had grandchildren, through all their joys and sorrows, their silver and golden anniversaries. But for Lina, no matter how her husband begged for her forgiveness, it was over now!\n[1960-01-01T13:30:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I knew the events of that time disappointed me. I sat next to Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia, but I wasn't listening to what they were saying. I thought I was waiting for Lina's resistance, but nothing happened. As usual, I couldn't guess what was going through Lina's mind. I didn't hear her scream, didn't hear her say anything threatening.\n[1960-01-01T14:00:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw him half an hour later, and Stefano appeared again, looking calm, having changed his clothes, and the layer of grayish white around his eyes and forehead had disappeared. I saw him moving among relatives and friends, maneuvering as he waited for the bride to arrive.\n[1960-01-01T14:05:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | When I saw Lina return to the hall again, she was no longer wearing her wedding dress but a light blue travel suit, with a blue hat on her head.\n[1960-01-01T14:10:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I saw her using a silver spoon to scoop candies from a crystal jar, handing them out to the children, then going from table to table distributing wedding candies.\n[1960-01-01T14:15:00] Wedding Venue | I saw her first give wedding candies to her parents, then to Stefano's. I saw her ignore the Solara family, even her own brother Rino.\n[1960-01-01T14:16:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I heard my brother speak with a bitter smile and ask, \"Did I offend you?\"\n[1960-01-01T14:17:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw she didn't answer, and I handed the wedding candy package to Pinocchia, who was sitting next to her brother. I saw Lina's eyes vacant, her cheeks flushed.\n[1960-01-01T14:18:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I saw it was my turn, and she absentmindedly handed me a ceramic basket filled with candies wrapped in white gauze. When I took the candy, she didn't give me a knowing smile.\n[1960-01-01T14:20:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw the Solara brothers embarrassed because of Lina's rudeness. Stefano hugged each of them one by one as compensation. His expression was calm, and he muttered something under his breath. I heard, \"She's tired, please be patient with her.\"\n[1960-01-01T14:21:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I saw him kiss Rino's cheek, and my brother-in-law looked very unhappy. I heard, \"She's not tired, Strega! I'm sorry, that's just her nature.\"\n[1960-01-01T14:22:00] Wedding ceremony site | I saw Stefano answer seriously. I heard, \"All problems will be solved.\"",

    "text": "[1960-01-01T14:23:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | At that moment, I saw Lina already at the door, and I saw Stefano run over to catch up with his wife. I heard the band playing chaotic music and saw many people crowded together, saying their goodbyes.\n[1960-01-01T14:25:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I knew their relationship had not broken down, so Lina and I wouldn't run away from here, we wouldn't wander the world. I thought, imagining that the bride and groom would get into an open car, beautiful and elegant, and before long they would reach the Amalfi Coast, in a luxurious hotel, where all the previous cruel insults would turn into a fleeting annoyance.\n[1960-01-01T14:26:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about Lina completely leaving me, without any regret. I suddenly felt that the distance between her and me was even greater than I had imagined—not just because she was married, nor just because every night she faithfully followed the rules of marriage and slept with a man.\n[1960-01-01T14:27:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought at the time, and suddenly something that had previously been unclear became clear: the shoes Lina had painstakingly made as a child were taken by her husband and traded with Marcello.\n[1960-01-01T14:28:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about how Lina would have to accept this reality, how she would have to admit that, for her, her husband was more important than anyone, anything else.\n[1960-01-01T14:29:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about how Lina had already made concessions, how she had forgiven that insult, which meant her relationship with Stefano had been very strong. She loved him, just like the girl in the photo novel, and she would have sacrificed her entire life for Stefano. But he didn't care at all about that sacrifice. He would take advantage of her rich emotions, her intelligence, and her imagination, without knowing how to respond. He would waste them away without realizing it.\n[1960-01-01T14:30:00] Wedding ceremony scene | I thought I would never be able to love anyone the way she did, not even Nino; I only knew how to pass the time by reading books.\n[1960-01-01T14:31:00] Wedding Ceremony Site | I thought, in that moment, I felt like a bowl with a crack—the bowl my sister Elena used to feed the cat, which never came back, leaving the empty bowl covered in dust, forgotten in the stairwell.\n[1960-01-01T14:32:00] Wedding Ceremony Scene | I thought about how I felt a strong anxiety, and I realized I was being overly dramatic, that I had gone too far. I told myself I should step back, that I should act like Camilla, Pinocchia, Giggia, or Lina, erase my pride, punish my arrogance, and no longer humiliate the person who loved me.\n[1960-01-01T14:40:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia leave, meeting Nino at the agreed-upon place. I avoided my mother's gaze and took a long detour to reach the terrace where I met my boyfriend.\n[1960-01-01T14:41:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw that the sun had already set, I was dressed very lightly, and I felt very cold.\n[1960-01-01T14:42:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw Antonio seeing me, he lit a cigarette and pretended to look at the sea.\n[1960-01-01T14:42:05] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | \"I heard 'Let's go.' I said.\"  \n\"You go with Nino's son!\"  \n\"I want to go with you.\"  \n\"Don't lie.\"  \n\"Why?\"  \n\"Because if that guy wants you, you'll leave me here without even saying goodbye.\"\n[1960-01-01T14:43:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I heard myself angrily say to him, \"My mother could come at any moment. For you, I might get a slap from her. If you don't understand the risk I'm taking by coming here, that means you're only thinking about yourself and don't care about me at all.\" I was really angry at how he spoke to me without the slightest restraint or hesitation.\n[1960-01-01T14:44:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw him throw away his cigarette and grab my wrist, without any restraint in the force he used. I thought about how, when he heard me speaking in long sentences, without using dialect and even using the subjunctive, it made him lose patience.\n[1960-01-01T14:44:10] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw him shouting at me—the kind of shout that came from deep in his throat. I heard him there, just for me, because I told him to stay with me all the time, in the church, at the place where we ate. Yes, it was me. \"You made me swear,\" he sighed, \"you said, you must swear you'll never leave me alone.\"\n[1960-01-01T14:44:20] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I heard, \"I made the dress and owed a lot of money to Signora Solara. I did it just to make you happy, to do what you said, not even spending a single minute with my mother, brothers, or sisters. But what did I get in return? I got treated like an idiot!\"\n[1960-01-01T14:44:30] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I heard, \"You've been talking all along with the son of that poet. You embarrassed me in front of all our friends, you made me look bad. Because to you, I'm nothing. You're educated, and I'm not. I can't understand what you're saying. It's true, I really don't understand! But damn it! Elena! Look at me, look into my eyes.\"\n[1960-01-01T14:44:40] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I heard, \"You think you can play with me, that I won't say 'no'! You're wrong. You know everything, but you don't know that if we walk out of this door now, if I say 'yes,' if we go together, but if I find out you're meeting that bastard Nino at school or somewhere else, I'll kill you! Elena, I'll kill you!\"\n[1960-01-01T14:44:50] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I heard him say, \"So you should think carefully, right here and now, leave me—this is the best choice for you.\" There was some desperation in his voice. I saw him with red eyes, his eyes wide open, staring at me. He spoke many words, not shouting, but as if he were shouting. His nostrils were flared wide, and his nose holes looked dark and hollow.\n[1960-01-01T14:45:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw the look on his face, and it was very painful. I thought about how I must have felt his inner pain even more. What he said came from deep within him, through his throat. Those words exploded in the air like a piece of iron slicing into his throat and lungs.\n[1960-01-01T14:45:10] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I thought, in the chaos, I felt I needed his intrusion, I needed him to grip my hand, I needed the feeling of being afraid he would hit me. Those endless, painful words even brought me comfort. I knew, he at least cared about me.\n[1960-01-01T14:45:20] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | \"I hurt you!\" I said. He slowly let go, but still had his mouth open, staring at me.\n[1960-01-01T14:45:30] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I thought about how I had decided to care about him, to submit to him, to rely on him—I already had a purple bruise on my wrist.\n[1960-01-01T14:45:40] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | \"I what's your decision?\" he asked me.  \n\"I want to be with you,\" I replied, pouting.\n[1960-01-01T14:46:00] Wedding Ceremony Terrace | I saw him close his mouth, then he looked out to the sea, trying hard to swallow back his tears. I saw tears in his eyes.\n[1960-01-01T15:00:00] On the way | I saw later, the two of us were walking alone on the road, we didn't wait for Pasquale, Enzo, and the other girls, and we didn't greet anyone. I knew the most important thing was to keep it from my mother, so we left on foot.\n[1960-01-01T15:01:00] Convertible car | I saw him, as usual, enduring her insults, forcing a smile, and saying nothing. In the end, Lina also fell silent.\n[1960-01-01T15:02:00] Convertible car | I saw it, but the silence didn't last long. Lina attacked him again, this time slowly, calmly, without urgency. I heard her say she didn't want to stay in the car anymore, not for a single minute. She hated breathing in the air he exhaled, and she wanted to get off right away.\n[1960-01-01T15:03:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina raise her voice and tell him to stop. I saw the disgust on Stefano's face, but he continued driving without saying a word.\n[1960-01-01T15:04:00] Convertible car | I saw that at this moment Stefano stopped the car, and when Lina actually tried to open the door, Stefano tightly grabbed her arm. I heard him say, \"Now, listen to me.\" He spoke slowly. \"There's a very serious reason for everything that's happened.\"\n[1960-01-01T15:05:00] Convertible car | I saw him calmly explain to Lina how it had happened. I knew that in order to prevent the shoe factory from closing down before its official opening, Silvio Solara and his two sons needed to invest.\n[1960-01-01T15:06:00] Convertible car | I know only they can ensure the shoes are sold in the best shoe stores in the city, and even let them open a store on Martiri Square. By autumn, there will be a shop specializing in \"Lina\" shoes.\n[1960-01-01T15:07:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina break in, trying to pull free from his hand. I heard, \"What's my problem?\"  \n\"My needs are your needs, you're my wife!\"  \n\"Me? To you, I'm nothing. And to me, you're the same. Let go of me!\"\n[1960-01-01T15:08:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano let her go. \"I heard you say, 'So your father and brother are nothing at all?'\"  \n\"Whenever you mention them, you'd better rinse your mouth first—you don't even deserve to talk about them.\"\n[1960-01-01T15:09:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano mentioning them by name, and he said that the matter of negotiating with Silvio Solara was brought up personally by Fernando. I heard him say that the biggest obstacle was Marcello, who was very angry with Lina.\n[1960-01-01T15:10:00] On the way | I saw that at first, we didn't touch each other physically. Later, he hesitated for a moment and put one arm over my shoulder. I saw that it was already dark outside.\n[1960-01-01T15:11:00] On the way | I realized he wanted me to understand that he was asking for my forgiveness, as if the one who had made a mistake was him. Because he loved me, he had decided to treat those scenes he had seen with his own eyes just a few hours before—my betrayal with Nino—as a hallucination.\n[1960-01-01T15:12:00] Convertible car | \"I heard you say, 'Then you gave him the shoes?' \" she still shouted. I thought it was a terrible moment, and Lina felt a sharp pain in her chest.\n[1960-01-01T15:13:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano look momentarily embarrassed. \"I heard, 'What can I do? Fight with your brother? Destroy your family? Let Marcello take revenge on your friends? Make me lose all the money I've invested?'\"\n[1960-01-01T15:14:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina didn't let him finish, she pounded Stefano's shoulder with her fists. I thought that for Lina, every word he said and his tone were a hypocritical disguise.",

I didn't answer.\n[1960-01-01T15:16:00] On the way | I saw him grasp my shoulder with his big hand, and I made a movement to push him away, which made him slow down.\n[1960-01-01T15:17:00] On the way | I saw him waiting, and I waited too. When he made another gesture of compromise, I reached out with one arm and wrapped it around his waist.\n[1960-01-01T15:18:00] Convertible car | I saw the moment she said \"dogshit man\" in her dialect, and Stefano's slap instantly landed heavily on Lina's face, so loud. I knew she realized she had crossed her husband's limit, and he could no longer remain calm. I thought of it as the revelation of a truth.\n[1960-01-01T15:19:00] Convertible car | I saw her looking at Stefano in disbelief, and he re-started the car, for the first time losing his calm tone. I felt my face burning painfully. I knew this was the first time he had lost control since he had started pursuing Lina.\n[1960-01-01T15:20:00] Convertible car | I heard him speak with a slightly trembling voice: \"You see, it's you who forced me to do this. Have you realized how far you've gone?\"  \n\"We were both wrong,\" she muttered.\n[1960-01-01T15:21:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano firmly reject her, as he always did with certainty. He said a long string of words, somewhat threatening, yet also instructive. I saw that they also used a tone filled with pain and lamentation.\n[1960-01-01T15:22:00] Convertible car | I heard, \"We're absolutely right, Lina. We just need to clarify some facts. You're no longer part of the Lina family. Now you're Mrs.Carracci, and you should do exactly what I told you. I know you're not a worldly person. You don't understand business. You think money just falls from the sky, but it's not like that. You have to work for it every day, and put it where it can make more money.\"\n[1960-01-01T15:23:00] Convertible car | I heard her say, \"You designed the shoes, your father and brother worked really hard, but even the three of you couldn't make any money. The Solara family could—okay, now listen to me, I don't care if you like that guy or not. I hate Marcello too, especially when he looks at you, when I think about what he said about you, I want to stab a knife into his stomach. But when it comes to making money, he's my best friend.\"\n[1960-01-01T15:24:00] Convertible car | I heard, \"Do you know why? Because if we don't make money, this car won't be ours anymore, I won't be able to buy you this dress, and we might even lose our house and everything in it. You won't be a rich lady anymore, and our children will grow up like beggars. So, if you talk to me like this again in the future, I'll beat your pretty face so badly you won't be able to show it in public. Do you understand? Answer me.\"\n[1960-01-01T15:25:00] Convertible car | I saw that she didn't answer him. I saw Lina's eyes squinting, her cheeks already purple, while the rest of her face was very pale.\n[1960-01-01T15:30:00] Dark Street | I saw us, constantly [intimate acts], behind the tree, under the building's gatehouse, on the dark street.\n[1960-01-01T16:30:00] Next to the railway | I saw that later we took the bus, changed once in the middle, arrived at the train station, and then walked along the rarely used path beside the railway toward the pond, all the while continuing our [intimate behavior].\n[1960-01-01T16:40:00] By the railway | I knew that despite my light dress, the cold night wind made me shiver. I thought about it, but I felt myself running a fever.\n[1960-01-01T16:45:00] Next to the railway | I saw that in the dark, Antonio sometimes pressed against me, and his fierce embrace hurt me. I thought about how I felt his lips burning, that heat igniting my fantasies.\n[1960-01-01T16:46:00] By the railway | I thought, maybe Lina and Stefano are already at the hotel, perhaps they're getting ready to eat, or preparing for the night. Ah, to fall asleep in the arms of a man, one wouldn't feel cold.\n[1960-01-01T16:50:00] By the railway | I saw myself touching his crotch through his pants pocket. I saw and felt Antonio's tongue moving in my mouth, his hands feeling my chest through my clothes.\n[1960-01-01T17:00:00] By the pond | I saw a black sky dotted with dim stars. I smelled the rotten mud of the pond and the musty scent of moss, which was overpowered by the sweet, syrupy fragrance of spring, and the grass was damp and wet.\n[1960-01-01T17:01:00] By the pond | I saw the water suddenly ripple, as if a acorn, a stone, or a frog had fallen into it.\n[1960-01-01T17:02:00] By the pond | I saw us walking slowly along a familiar road, a path that led to a row of withered trees. I saw that the trunk was thin, and the branches had been cut in a messy way.\n[1960-01-01T17:03:00] By the pond | I saw a dilapidated canning factory a few meters away, a house with a collapsed roof, leaving only the ridge and some rusted metal sheets.\n[1960-01-01T17:04:00] By the pond | I thought of how it was like a piece of fluff thread tugging at me from inside my body, my desires surging, my urgent longing for their fulfillment to shatter everything that day. A sensation of pleasure stirred beneath my abdomen, stronger than ever before.\n[1960-01-01T17:05:00] By the pond | I saw him, his mouth against mine, his neck against mine, speaking sweet nothings to me in his dialect, his voice passionate and urgent. I said nothing, as I always did during our secret meetings—I just breathed heavily. I heard him say, \"Tell me, do you love me?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Tell me.\"  \n\"Yes.\"\n[1960-01-01T17:06:00] By the pond | I didn't say anything else, I held him, I held him tightly with all my strength. I thought about how I longed for him to kiss me and caress every part of my body. I needed to be bitten, crushed, I longed for the feeling of not being able to catch my breath.\n[1960-01-01T17:07:00] By the pond | I saw him push me aside a bit, still engaging in [intimate act] with me, one hand reaching into my bra, but I still felt it wasn't enough. I thought of that night, and for me, it was still far from enough.\n[1960-01-01T17:08:00] By the pond | I knew that all our previous interactions had been carefully proposed by him, and I had also cautiously accepted them. I thought about it, but that time I felt it wasn't enough, and an uncomfortable feeling quickly took over my body. Yet I didn't know how to tell him I wanted more, I didn't know how to say it.\n[1960-01-01T17:09:00] By the pond | I know that every time we meet in secret, it's a silent ritual, one after another. He touches my breasts, lifts my skirt, and strokes the skin between my legs, and at that moment, he signals me to touch him there, where his skin is soft and sensitive.\n[1960-01-01T17:10:00] Edge of the pond | I saw it, but that time I hesitated and didn't touch his lower body. I know that if I do that, he will ignore me, stop paying attention to my feelings, stop touching me, let go of my chest, waist, and lower body, and focus only on my hands. Soon he will take my hand and guide it to move in the correct rhythm.\n[1960-01-01T17:11:00] By the pond | I know that then he would take out his handkerchief, preparing for that moment. He would let out a soft moan, and a dangerous liquid would flow from his lower body. He might feel a bit dizzy. Maybe because of embarrassment, and then we would go home.\n[1960-01-01T17:12:00] By the pond | I thought of my urgent need to change this usual ending: I don't care about getting pregnant before marriage! Heaven has eyes, but I don't care about committing a sin right under the gods' watchful gaze. I don't care about the Holy Spirit or any other gods.\n[1960-01-01T17:13:00] By the pond | I saw Antonio sense my desire, and he became a little flustered. As he [intimate act], he grew more and more excited, pushing my hand down again and again. I thought about it, but I kept pulling my hand back.\n[1960-01-01T17:14:00] By the pond | I saw my pubic bone facing him as he ran his fingers over me, and I pressed myself against him again and again, letting out long, drawn-out sighs. At that moment, he pulled one hand away, trying to undo his pants.",

    "text": "[1960-01-01T17:15:00] Canning Factory | I saw myself leading him to the dilapidated and abandoned canning factory. \"I'll be right there,\" I said.\n[1960-01-01T17:16:00] Cannery | I saw that it was darker and more secluded, but there were rats everywhere, and I could hear the sound of them scurrying back and forth.\n[1960-01-01T17:17:00] Canning Factory | I thought of my heart starting to beat wildly, I was afraid of that place, afraid of myself, afraid of my own fervor.\n[1960-01-01T17:18:00] Canning Plant | I was thinking—just a few hours ago, I had realized my sense of detachment from this Mergellina. Now I want to erase that feeling, that way, that sound. I want to go back into my Mergellina, sink deep into it, just like always.\n[1960-01-01T17:19:00] Cannery | I thought about giving up my studies, throwing away the notebook filled with my homework. Doing homework? Why do homework? Everything I did outside the shadow and influence of Lina didn't matter at all.\n[1960-01-01T17:20:00] Cannery | I thought about her in a wedding dress, in an open-top car, wearing a blue hat, dressed in a light blue suit. What was I compared to her?\n[1960-01-01T17:21:00] Cannery | I saw myself secretly meeting Antonio among the rusted scrap iron, listening to the rustling of mice, lifting my skirt above my waist, filled with urgent, painful, and guilty feelings. I imagine Lina and Stefano lying on the linen sheets, naked and relaxed in a room facing the sea. Stefano would take her, entering deep into her body, planting a seed within her. They are legal, without any fear. But what am I?\n[1960-01-01T17:22:00] Cannery | I saw Antonio adjusting his pants. I was between his legs, his massive male body rubbing against my lower body, he moved while panting.\n[1960-01-01T17:23:00] Cannery | I thought about how, at that time, I didn't know what to do. All I knew was that it wasn't what I wanted. He was just brushing against me, but that wasn't enough. I wanted to be pierced, I wanted to tell Lina when she came back: I'm no longer a virgin. Whatever you do, I'll do too. I won't fall behind you.\n[1960-01-01T17:24:00] Cannery | I saw it, so I wrapped my arms around Antonio's neck, [intimate gesture], pressing myself against him. I stood on my toes, letting my body respond to his body, but I said nothing, just trying.\n[1960-01-01T17:25:00] Cannery | I saw that he also realized it, and he reached out to support me with his hand. I saw and felt his body go in a little bit, filled with curiosity and fear.\n[1960-01-01T17:26:00] Cannery | I thought about how I felt him struggling to hold back, preventing himself from pushing forward with all his strength. That was the power he had built up throughout the entire afternoon, and at that moment, that drive had not yet faded.\n[1960-01-01T17:27:00] Cannery | I saw that I had realized it, so I pressed close to him, wanting him to continue. I know he's about to give up.\n[1960-01-01T17:28:00] Cannery | I saw Antonio let out a breath, then pushed me away, speaking in dialect. I heard, \"No, Elena, we have to be married to do this, it won't work like this.\"\n[1960-01-01T17:29:00] Cannery | I saw him with a heavy, stifled breath, and he took my right hand and placed it on him. I comforted him with my hand.\n[1960-01-01T18:00:00] By the pond | I saw it all the way to the end, when we came out from the pond, and he said awkwardly that he respected me. I knew he didn't want to do something that would make me regret it, in that dirty place, in such an unseemly, careless way.\n[1960-01-01T18:10:00] By the pond | I thought that when he said those words, it was as if he was about to cross a boundary, maybe he really believed that was how things were.\n[1960-01-01T18:30:00] At the entrance of Posillipo | I said nothing all the way. It wasn't until I said goodbye that I felt a sense of relief.\n[1960-01-01T18:35:00] Posillipo | I saw myself knocking on the door, and it was my mother who opened it. She didn't shout, nor did she say a word of reproach. I saw that even though my brother was holding her back, I still felt the slap she gave me straight across the face.\n[1960-01-01T18:36:00] Posillipo | I saw my glasses fly straight to the ground, and I immediately shouted in a mocking tone, without the slightest trace of dialect, I shouted in pure Italian. I heard, \"Look what you've done! You broke my glasses. Because of you, I can't study anymore. I'm never going to school again.\"\n[1960-01-01T18:37:00] Posillipo | I saw my mother freeze instantly; she had been hitting my hand, and her arm, like an axe, stopped midair. My little sister Elisa picked up the glasses and said softly. \"I heard, 'Take it, Elena, your glasses aren't broken.'\"\n[1960-01-01T20:00:00] Amalfi Hotel | That night, they arrived in Amalfi, and since the two of them had never stayed in a hotel before, they felt very uncomfortable. I saw the receptionist speaking to Stefano with a mocking tone, making him feel particularly embarrassed; he couldn't help but act somewhat servile.\n[1960-01-01T20:10:00] Amalfi Hotel | I saw him immediately try to cover up his embarrassment in a stiff way. The receptionist asked him to show his ID, and his ears turned red. I saw that at the same time, a porter appeared, a man with a short mustache, probably around fifty years old, but Stefano pushed him aside as if he were a thief. Yet, after thinking about it, he gave him a generous tip even though he hadn't used the service.\n[1960-01-01T20:15:00] Amarphi Hotel Stairs | I saw him carrying his luggage up the stairs in front of Lina. I thought of Lina telling me that each step made her feel that, on the way, she had already lost the man she had married that morning, and now the one with her was a stranger.\n[1960-01-01T20:20:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | As soon as I entered the room, he tried to make himself gentle, but he was also exhausted. After slapping Lina, he felt very uneasy inside.\n[1960-01-01T20:21:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw him praise the room's spaciousness in a hypocritical tone, then open the sliding window and step onto the balcony, calling her over to feel the fragrance of the air and admire the shimmering sea. Stefano immediately closed the window and suggested going for a walk, adding that they should eat outside and dress warmly. I heard him say, \"Why don't you bring me a suit vest?\"\n[1960-01-01T20:22:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw Lina acting obediently, but in reality, she hadn't opened her suitcase—not taking out the sweater, nor the dress shirt. I thought she was already on the corridor, she didn't want to stay in the room for another minute.\n[1960-01-01T21:00:00] Amalfi Street | I saw them wandering around Amalfi, walking all the way to the cathedral, up the steps, and in front of the fountain. Stefano tried to cheer her up, but making people laugh had never been his strength.\n[1960-01-01T21:10:00] Amalfi Street | I saw Lina start to tremble quickly, not because it was especially cold, but because she was extremely nervous and anxious. He noticed this and suggested she go back to the hotel. I heard him boldly say, \"If we hold each other, we'll be warm.\"\n[1960-01-01T21:30:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw that they ordered a lot of food, but hardly ate anything, just drank a lot of wine. For a moment, he couldn't help asking her if she was still angry. Hearing the question, Lina shook her head. She really wasn't angry. I thought it was surprising that toward the Solara brothers, her father and brother, and Stefano, there was not the slightest hatred in my heart, and everything had vanished like smoke.\n[1960-01-01T21:35:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I was afraid when I saw her wearing the heavy, shiny wedding ring on her index finger. I thought about how she had once again gone over everything that happened that day, and everything seemed unbelievable: the church, the religious wedding ceremony, and the banquet.\n[1960-01-01T21:36:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw that Stefano also had one, shining brightly among the dark hairs on his hairy fingers. What have I done? What is this gold ring? What exactly is this shining circle that I'm wearing on my hand?\n[1960-01-01T21:37:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought about how she remembered him in his swimsuit, just as if she had seen him by the sea: a broad chest, a huge head like an overturned bowl. When she looked back, none of his details had ever been attractive to her.\n[1960-01-01T21:38:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw how the strange creature before me—Stefano—lit up, thinking the storm had passed, thinking she had finally understood why he had done what he did and accepted his explanation, and now he could finally tell her about his great plans. I thought of Lina, imagining her secretly taking a knife from the table, thinking that if Stefano dared to touch her when she returned to the room, she would stab him in the throat with the knife.\n[1960-01-01T21:39:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought in the end, Lina didn't do it, because in that restaurant, at that table, she was so drunk she was out of her mind. Throughout the whole wedding, from the wedding dress to the wedding ring, everything seemed meaningless to her. She found Stefano's sexual demands meaningless too, which were absurd even for him.\n[1960-01-01T22:00:00] Amalfi Street | I saw that on the way, Stefano started talking about the advantages of the Solara family. He spoke about them, pretending to be knowledgeable, and emphasized, \"Politics is ugly, but it's important for making money.\" I thought about Lina and the analysis she had done with Pasquale, about the things they talked about after their engagement, their plans. She said \"yes\" aloud, but in reality, she was distracted.\n[1960-01-01T22:10:00] Amalfi Street | I saw Stefano holding Lina's hand and telling her he loved her, and she didn't step back. I thought she would say that it's the same whether it's with the hotel porter or with you—intimate acts. Both of your fingers are yellow from smoking, and it makes me sick.\n[1960-01-01T22:30:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw them just enter the room, and Stefano immediately tried to [intimate] her, but she pulled away. She looked serious, opened her suitcase, took out her nightgown, and then handed it to her husband.\n[1960-01-01T22:35:00] Hotel Bathroom | I saw Lina alone in the bathroom, trying to sober up and get rid of that lingering sense of fragmentation. I thought about how she regretted not taking the dinner knife. For a moment, she thought she had taken it, but in the end, she had to admit she hadn't.\n[1960-01-01T22:40:00] Hotel Bathroom | I saw her sitting on the edge of the bathtub, comparing the hotel's bathtub with the one in our new home. I thought about how all these new and beautiful things belonged to the man outside waiting for her, and she felt annoyed because only by taking his name could she possess them. Those good things all belonged to the Caracci family, including herself.\n[1960-01-01T22:45:00] Bathroom of the hotel | I saw Stefano wait a little longer, knock again, but still there was no response. He nervously pulled the door handle and said in a deliberately joking tone. I heard, \"I'm breaking in, okay!\"\n[1960-01-01T22:46:00] Hotel Bathroom | I saw her take off her clothes, brush her teeth, and put on her nightgown. I thought that Lina had no doubt he would do it, this stranger waiting for her outside was capable of anything. She thought, me too, I'm capable of anything too.\n[1960-01-01T22:50:00] Hotel room | \"I've been washing for a long time,\" I said. \"It does take some time.\" \"You're so beautiful!\" \"I'm tired, I want to sleep.\" \"We'll sleep together later.\" \"You sleep on your side now, I'll sleep on mine.\" \"Okay, come on.\" \"I wasn't joking.\" \"I wasn't either.\"\n[1960-01-01T22:51:00] Room in a hotel | I saw Stefano smile slightly and try to take her hand. She pulled away, and he frowned. Lina hesitated. She wanted to find the right words, speaking slowly and deliberately. I heard, \"I don't want you.\"\n[1960-01-01T22:52:00] Hotel Room | I saw him whisper that he had been waiting for this moment for a long time, longing for it all along. He pointed to his scarlet pajamas and gave a crooked smile. I heard \"Please.\" He pleaded, \"Look! Just seeing you here is going to cause something.\"\n[1960-01-01T22:53:00] Hotel Room | I saw it happen and Stefano realized: she was trying to lock herself in the bathroom again. Like an animal, he lunged forward and grabbed her waist, lifting her and throwing her onto the bed. I wondered what was happening? It was obvious he didn't want to know. He thought that in the restaurant they had already made up, and he didn't understand why Lina was acting like this now—too childish.\n[1960-01-01T22:54:00] Hotel Room | \"I heard, 'That's a beautiful thing.' He said, 'You don't have to be afraid, I love you more than I love my mother and sister.'\"\n[1960-01-01T22:55:00] Hotel Room | I saw it but didn't act, she stood up and avoided him. I thought to myself, how hard it is to figure out this girl's mind! She says \"yes\" but means \"no,\" and says \"no\" but actually means \"yes.\"\n[1960-01-01T22:56:00] Hotel Room | I saw Stefano whisper, \"Stop acting like a child.\" He grabbed her again, straddling her and pressing her hands onto the bedsheet. He leaned down to kiss her, but she turned away, shaking her head from side to side, struggling constantly, twisting her body, and firmly repeating. I heard, \"Let me go! I don't want you! I don't want you! I don't want you!\"\n[1960-01-01T22:57:00] Hotel Room | I heard him say, \"Lina, I can't fucking stand it!\" He repeated it two or three times, his voice getting louder each time, as if he were trying to mimic an ancient spell. I saw him lying on her slender waist, his broad and clumsy body pressing down, his genitals lifting her pajamas like a tent.\n[1960-01-01T22:58:00] Hotel Room | I know she remembers how, a few years ago, he pinched her tongue with his hand, trying to poke it with a needle, because she had beaten his brother Alfonso Carracci in a school competition, humiliating him. I thought, and suddenly I realized: he had always been Don Achille's eldest son!\n[1960-01-01T22:59:00] Hotel Room | I saw that idea make her husband's youthful face suddenly show some features, which had been quietly hidden out of caution, but they had always remained in Stefano's blood. I thought I saw Don Achille rising from the mire of this Mergellina, taking possession of his son. Don Achille was emerging from Stefano's skin, changing his gaze, bursting out from his body.",

    "text": "[1960-01-02T08:00:00] Posillipo | I feel completely exhausted, no matter how much I rest, I never seem to recover.\n[1960-01-02T09:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that I had skipped school for the first time, and I didn't go to school. I know I remember that I didn't go to school for fifteen days, not even with Antonio. I didn't tell him I couldn't continue reading my books, and I wanted to drop out.\n[1960-01-05T09:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself going out as usual, wandering around the city all morning. During this time, I became even more familiar with San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1960-01-05T09:30:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself browsing old books at the used book stall in the dawn port, and I couldn't help but remember the titles and the names of the authors.\n[1960-01-05T10:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself continuing forward, arriving at Toledo, reaching the sea, walking along Salvador Rosa Street, getting on Piazza del Plebiscito, going to San Martino, and then returning through Petraio.\n[1960-01-05T11:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself stumbling along Via D'Annunzio, walking all the way to the cemetery, silently walking along the shady path, reading the names of the dead on the tombstones.\n[1960-01-05T12:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | Sometimes I encounter idle young men, slow-moving elderly people, or even seemingly refined middle-aged gentlemen, who flirt with me using vulgar language.\n[1960-01-05T12:01:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself looking down, quickening my steps, rushing away in a hurry. I saw that danger was approaching.\n[1960-01-05T13:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about it, but I didn't stop there—I went even further. Those mornings spent loitering around made me increasingly indifferent to the school's rules, the regulations that had been imprisoning me since I was six years old.\n[1960-01-05T17:00:00] Posillipo | I saw myself coming home on time, no one suspected me — suspecting that I hadn't gone to school.\n[1960-01-05T18:00:00] By the pond | I spent the afternoon reading a novel, and later I went to the pond to meet Antonio, because I always had time to see him. I saw that Antonio was very happy now.\n[1960-01-05T18:05:00] By the pond | I thought about how he had wanted to ask me if I'd seen Nino's son. I saw the question in his eyes, but he didn't dare to ask me, afraid of starting an argument, afraid I would get angry, and also afraid of losing that brief moment of pleasure.\n[1960-01-05T18:10:00] By the pond | I saw him embracing me, my body yielded to him, and his doubts disappeared. I thought that at those moments, he had also ruled out the possibility of me seeing that boy and cheating on him.\n[1960-01-05T20:00:00] My room | I realized he was wrong! Actually, despite the guilt I felt, I had been thinking about Nino all along, I longed to meet him and talk to him.\n[1960-01-05T20:05:00] Lina's New House | I saw Rino put on an air of worldly sophistication, speaking earnestly and indignantly. I heard, \"In many cases, we have to make some sacrifices.\"\n[1960-01-05T20:06:00] Lina's New Home | \"I heard him say, 'Do you know who's at greater risk? It's them—their friends. Marcello recognized them, and he's certain it was you who sent them. What should I do with Stefano? They beat someone, and they'll have to pay double. Do you want to ruin them? Marcello really cared about those shoes. To stop him from pursuing the matter, we gave them to him.'\"\n[1960-01-05T20:07:00] Lina's new house | I had always seen Lina as someone who was very good at talking, but to my surprise, she didn't say a word that time. Rino let out a sigh of relief, speaking in a slightly reproachful tone, saying that ever since she was young, she had always been chasing after him, saying she wanted to get rich.\n[1960-01-05T20:10:00] My room | I thought, but on the other hand, I was also a little afraid—I feared his sense of superiority would make me feel humiliated. I was afraid that, as he talked, he might bring up the reason why the article about my conflict with the religious teacher had never been published. I was afraid he might tell me about the editors' merciless criticisms, things I simply couldn't bear.\n[1960-01-05T20:20:00] My room | I thought that whether I was walking through the city or lying awake in bed at night, I clearly felt my own inadequacy. I would rather believe that the article had been thrown into the trash because the magazine had no more space left, and couldn't fit it in.\n[1960-01-05T20:30:00] My room | I thought about how I wished to gradually forget this, let it fade away, but it wasn't easy. I didn't have Nino's talent, so I wasn't worthy of being by his side, of sharing my thoughts with him, of having him listen to me.\n[1960-01-05T20:40:00] My room | I thought about what thoughts I had. I didn't have any thoughts at all. I should be sensible and stop reading, stop being obsessed with grades and praise, and retreat when things get difficult.\n[1960-01-05T20:45:00] Lina's New Home | I saw Stefano passing around the wedding photos, which he had just picked up from the photographer. I saw that just a few minutes ago, Rino had been speaking in a rude manner, but now he had suddenly become gentle, saying exaggerated sweet words, saying that they would hold their engagement ceremony in his sister's beautiful house.\n[1960-01-05T20:50:00] My room | I thought about how I wished I could gradually forget all of it—the thoughts that occupied my mind all day, the dead or living languages, the Italian that even came out when I spoke with a few of my brothers.\n[1960-01-05T21:00:00] My room | I thought to myself, it's all Lina's fault that I'm like this. I should forget her. Lina always knew exactly what she wanted, and she always got it. But I don't want anything, and I don't have any value myself. I just want to wake up in the morning with no expectations at all.\n[1960-01-05T21:10:00] My room | When I cleared my mind, I thought about my next move: Antonio's feelings for me, and my feelings for him— that was enough.\n[1960-01-10T16:00:00] Street | One day, when I came home, I met Stefano's sister, Pinocchia. I knew that I learned from her that Lina had just returned from her honeymoon and had prepared a big meal to celebrate her brother and sister-in-law's engagement.\n[1960-01-10T16:01:00] On the street | \"I saw 'You're engaged to Rino?' I pretended to be surprised.\" I heard \"Yes.\" She told me happily and showed me her engagement ring.\n[1960-01-10T16:02:00] On the street | I thought about when I remembered Pinocchio saying those words, and my heart was in turmoil—Lila had thrown a party at her new house, but she didn't invite me. But I thought, it's probably better this way. I'm glad, I'll never have to compare myself to her again, I don't want to see her ever again.\n[1960-01-10T16:03:00] Street | I didn't realize that Pinocchio had finished explaining every part of the engagement ceremony until I carefully asked about my friend Lina. Pinocchio let out a dry laugh and answered me in dialect: \"She's still learning.\"\n[1960-01-10T17:00:00] Posillipo | I didn't ask what she was studying. That day, I went straight home and fell asleep, sleeping all afternoon.\n[1960-01-11T07:00:00] Street | I saw the next day, I left home at seven o'clock as usual, heading to school, or rather, pretending to go to school.\n[1960-01-11T07:05:00] Street | I saw Lina getting out of the convertible as I had just crossed the road. She didn't even turn back and rushed into my yard, not bothering to greet Stefano, who was sitting at the steering wheel.\n[1960-01-11T07:06:00] Street | I saw her dressed elegantly, and even though there was no sun, she was wearing a pair of dark sunglasses. The blue scarf was especially unusual—she had tied it into a knot and used it to cover her mouth.\n[1960-01-11T07:07:00] Street | I saw myself walking straight ahead, ignoring her. I thought to myself, annoyed, that it must be her new style, no longer like Jacqueline Kennedy, but more like the mysterious woman we all wanted to become since childhood.\n[1960-01-11T07:08:00] Street | I took a few steps and then turned back, not for any reason, just some kind of compulsion. I thought my heart was beating fast, my mind was in a mess. Maybe I wanted to hear her say it to my face—that our friendship was over. Maybe I wanted to shout at her that I didn't want to go to school anymore, that I also wanted to get married and live in Antonio's house, to live with his mother and brothers and sisters, to clean the stairs together with the crazy widow Melina.\n[1960-01-11T07:09:00] Staircase in the courtyard | I saw myself quickly crossing the courtyard, seeing her enter the building where her mother-in-law lived. I climbed the stairs. I know, the stairs we took together that time when we were kids and went to Don Achille to get our dolls back.\n[1960-01-11T07:10:00] Stairs | I called her name, and she turned around. I said, \"You're back?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Why didn't you come see me?\"  \n\"I didn't want you to see me.\"  \n\"Everyone else can see you, but not me?\"  \n\"I don't care about the others, but you're different.\"\n[1960-01-11T07:11:00] Stairs | I saw myself hesitatingly looking at her. What could she possibly have that I couldn't see?\n[1960-01-11T07:12:00] On the stairs | I saw myself climbing a few steps upward, approaching her. I carefully lifted her veil and her sunglasses.\n[1960-01-11T07:13:00] On the stairs | I saw Lina walking up the stairs to her mother-in-law's house. I took off her glasses, removed her scarf, and there she was, just like that. I saw that the skin around her eyes was slightly yellowed, and there was a purple bruise on her lower lip, still streaked with blood.",

    "text": "[1960-01-11T07:14:00] Stairs | I saw her telling her relatives and friends that on a bright morning, she and her husband had gone in a small boat to the beach under the yellow cliffs, and they ended up like this after hitting the rocks at Amalfi Beach. I knew that when she told the lie, she used a mocking tone, and everyone, with mocking expressions, believed her. So her bruises didn't provoke any condemnation of Stefano; instead, those around her only grew more admiring and respectful of him.\n[1960-01-11T07:15:00] Stairs | I saw Lina in such a pitiful state that my heart was almost in my throat. I hugged her. She told me she hadn't come to see me because she didn't want me to see her like this. Tears filled my eyes. I was happy to realize that Lina now also needed help, or rather, protection. She never showed any weakness in front of everyone at Mergellina, only in front of me, which surprised me and moved me deeply.\n[1960-01-11T07:16:00] Stairs | \"I remember when Don Achille didn't give us dolls, but gave us some money instead?\" she asked me.  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"We shouldn't have taken that money.\"  \n\"We used it to buy a copy of Little Women.\"  \n\"We were wrong. From that moment on, I've been making mistakes all along.\"\n[1960-01-11T07:17:00] Stairs | I saw her, not excited but very sad. She put on her glasses and re-tied her scarf. I thought I felt happy because she said \"we\" shouldn't have taken that money, that \"we\" were wrong. But what made me uncomfortable was how suddenly she changed the pronoun, from \"we\" to \"I have been making a mistake all along.\"\n[1960-01-11T07:18:00] Stairs | I heard, \"Do you want to come study at my house?\"  \n\"Whenever?\"  \n\"Today afternoon, tomorrow, anytime is fine.\"  \n\"Stefano will be annoyed.\"  \n\"If he's the master, then I'm the mistress.\"\n[1960-01-11T07:19:00] Stairs | \"I don't know if this will work, Lina,\" I said.  \n\"I'll give you a room, you can study in it by yourself, and close the door.\"  \n\"What's the point?\" She shrugged. \"At least I know you're there.\"\n[1960-01-11T07:20:00] Stairs | I didn't say I was going, nor did I say I wasn't. I left, wandering around the city as usual. I thought of Lina, who was certain I would never give up my studies. To her, I was just that friend with glasses and pimples, always buried in books. She could never imagine me changing. I no longer wanted to play that role.\n[1960-01-11T07:30:00] City | I didn't go to her house that afternoon and in the following days; instead, I continued skipping school, and I was very conflicted inside. I thought about Nino and me, like Lina, but although he too had grown up in this poor, miserable neighborhood, he would escape it through his studies, while I couldn't. So I decided to stop living in illusions, to stop wasting my time in vain.\n[1960-01-15T12:00:00] Near the school | I saw one morning, I was loitering behind the botanical garden not far from school. The school had already let out, and I found myself walking toward the school, lingering near it. Some students were already coming out of the school, and I heard someone calling me—Alfonso Carracci, who was waiting for Pinochietta.\n[1960-01-15T12:05:00] Near the school | \"I heard you say, 'You're together now?'\" I teased him.  \n\"No, it's her who kept insisting.\"  \n\"Liar.\"  \n\"You're the liar. You told me you were sick, but I saw you just fine. Teacher Galiani always asks about you, and I told her you had a high fever.\"  \n\"I really did have a fever.\"  \n\"It doesn't look like it at all.\"\n[1960-01-15T12:06:00] Near the school | I saw that Alfonso Carracci looked gentle. I wondered if he, too, was carefully hiding my father Don Achille inside his heart? Would parents never really die, so that every child inevitably hides them within his heart? So would my mother's shadow inevitably appear upon me?\n[1960-01-15T12:07:00] Near the school | I heard myself asking him, \"Did you see what your brother did to Lina?\"  \nAlfonso Carracci looked a bit embarrassed. \"I did.\"  \n\"Didn't you say anything?\"  \n\"It depends on what Lina did to him.\"\n[1960-01-15T12:08:00] Near the school | I heard, \"Will you do the same to Pinocchio?\"  \nHe smiled shyly. \"No.\"  \n\"Are you sure?\"  \n\"Sure.\"  \n\"Why?\"  \n\"Because I know you, we chat, we go to school together.\"\n[1960-01-15T12:09:00] Near the school | I saw Pinocchio appear at the end of the street, running because she was late. He didn't turn around, just shrugged and whispered. \"I heard 'Your girlfriend is here.' I said.\"  \n\"Come back to school, please.\"  \n\"I'm not feeling well,\" I said again, and then left.\n[1960-01-15T12:15:00] On the way | I didn't want to greet Nino's sister at all; every memory I recalled made me feel uneasy. As I walked, Alfonso Carracci's words kept coming back to my mind again and again. I thought about how he said he would never physically abuse his future wife to show his authority—because he had met me, because of our conversation, because we were classmates. He had openly expressed his thoughts, although in an ambiguous way, but it was sincere. He attributed all of it to me, because I could influence him, could change the way he behaved as a man.\n[1960-01-16T08:00:00] School | The next day, I forged my mother's signature and went back to school. That night, by the pond, I held Antonio tightly to keep the cold away, and I promised him that once I finished that school year, we would get married.\n[1960-01-20T18:00:00] By the pond | I heard that every time I asked to cancel our date because of my studies, his face would darken and he'd nervously ask, \"What's wrong?\" \"I have a lot of homework to do.\" \"Are you hiding something from me, Elena?\" \"Of course not!\" \"Do you still love me?\" I thought about how exhausted I was every day, having to make up for all the classes I had missed, especially in science. To focus on studying, I wanted to reduce the time I spent meeting Antonio, but it was really hard.\n[1960-01-20T18:05:00] By the pond | I saw that I let him rest assured. I thought about Antonio's dilemma, which was always the same: Nino's son. He was afraid I would talk to him, and also afraid of seeing him. I felt helpless, so in order not to make him suffer, even when I accidentally met Nino on the way to or from school, or in the hallway, I kept it a secret from Antonio.\n[1960-01-20T20:00:00] Posillipo | I heard my mother arguing with me about everything, and each of my brothers would throw their homework at me. I know I can't study at home, especially since my mother has neurasthenia. Usually, I spend the whole afternoon helping my mother with housework and helping my younger brothers with their homework. I hardly have any time to study myself.\n[1960-01-25T10:00:00] School | I remember once on the same day, I got two points in chemistry, four in art history, and three in philosophy. My fragile nerves had been tense all along, and when I received the worst score of all, I finally burst into tears in front of everyone. I think back to those truly terrible times, when I fell into depravity and lost myself. It both terrified and thrilled me, frightened me and filled me with pride.\n[1960-01-25T14:00:00] Lina's New House | I saw Alfonso Carracci at the school gate, who told me that his sister wanted me to go to her house. That afternoon, I headed toward the new residential area. I thought about going to Lina's house, not to resolve the troubles I'd had at school. We would definitely keep talking, and I wanted her to know that even I, who used to be a model student, was starting to perform worse in my studies. I felt I would eventually get married.\n[1960-01-25T14:10:00] Lina's New House | I saw myself going, and Lina was very happy. Her eyes had already stopped swelling, and her lips were slowly healing. She was dressed beautifully, her hair perfectly combed, and she had even put on lipstick. She walked around her own house as if she were a stranger, like a guest in someone else's home.\n[1960-01-25T14:15:00] Lina's kitchen | I saw Lina making me a cup of coffee, and we sat in the spacious kitchen together. I felt happy, as if I were two well-to-do ladies, just like the games we used to play in the basement vent when we were children. I felt completely relaxed, and I realized that it had been a mistake not to come here before.\n[1960-01-25T14:20:00] Lina's kitchen | \"I heard you and Stefano how are you?\" I asked.  \n\"Fine.\"  \n\"Did you both clear things up?\"  \nShe laughed happily. \"Yeah, we did.\"  \n\"So what now?\"  \n\"I still feel sick.\"  \n\"Like in Amalfi?\"  \n\"Yeah.\"\n[1960-01-25T14:21:00] Lina's Kitchen | I heard, \"Does he still hit you?\"  \nShe touched her face. \"No, these are old scars.\"  \n\"What about him now?\"  \n\"He humiliates me.\"  \n\"What do you do?\"  \n\"Whatever he wants, I do.\"",

    "text": "[1960-01-25T14:22:00] Lina's kitchen | I heard that and after thinking for a while, I asked her in an indirect way: \"At least when you two slept together, it was still okay, right?\" I saw her become serious, her expression a bit unnatural. She began talking about her husband, whom she strongly disliked, yet had no choice but to accept him. It wasn't hostility, nor did it call for revenge, and there was even no real hatred—just a calm contempt, a complete disdain for her husband as a person, as if he were dirty water on the ground.\n[1960-01-25T14:23:00] Kitchen of Lina | I thought about how Lina once held a knife to Marcello's throat and threatened him, but now she showed no obvious hostility toward Stefano. Of course, the reason was simple: we had all grown up watching our father beat our mother. Yet Lina appeared obedient, but without the slightest respect.\n[1960-01-25T14:24:00] Lina's kitchen | I heard myself say to her: \"Even if I don't love Antonio, I feel comfortable being with him.\" I thought of how I wished, as we had before, she would grasp all the hidden meanings in this sentence: even though I loved Nino—though I hadn't said it outright—just thinking about Antonio, about our intimate embrace, about our closeness by the pond, would still make me excited and stirred. But she only said to me, in a somewhat sarcastic tone, \"You seem to be able to feel at ease. That's nice.\"\n[1960-01-25T14:25:00] Small Room | I saw and then she led me into a small room facing the railway tracks. The room was empty, with only a desk, a chair, and a folding bed. There were no decorations on the walls. I heard, \"Do you like it here?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Then you'll study here.\"  \nAfter saying that, she turned and closed the door behind her and left.\n[1960-01-25T14:26:00] Small Room | I saw myself sitting at the desk, opening the history book, forcing myself to study. I heard her pacing around the house and making a phone call. To my shock, she didn't say, \"Hello, this is Lina,\" but instead said, \"Hello, this is Mrs. Karachi.\"\n[1960-02-01 08:00:00] Street | I knew that a few months later, a pneumonia almost took her husband's life.\n[1960-02-01T14:00:00] Lina's New House | I saw that although my mother was reluctant, I still developed the habit of going directly to Lina's house after school. I usually arrived there at two o'clock in the afternoon, setting down my textbooks. She would prepare a sandwich for me, filled with ham, cheese, and sausage—everything I wanted to eat. I knew the high school building was in bad shape, with leaky classrooms. A section of road just a few meters from our school had collapsed after a violent storm, leading to a period of alternating attendance, during which homework became more important than attending classes.\n[1960-02-05T15:00:00] Lina's bathroom | I remember one afternoon when I really didn't feel like studying, so I asked Lina if I could take a shower. I took off my clothes and got into the water, leaving only my head above the surface. I saw how warm it was! The pleasure was beyond my expectations. After a while, the bathtub was full of bubbles in every corner, surrounding me like they were about to overflow.\n[1960-02-05T15:10:00] Lina's bathroom | I saw that I had found lipstick, cosmetics, a hair dryer, and a large mirror that didn't distort the image. I discovered that my skin had become smoother than ever before, my hair was fluffy and shiny, even more golden. I thought that the wealth we had always wanted might just be this: wealth wasn't a safe full of gold coins and diamonds, but a bathtub, where I could soak every day.\n[1960-02-05T20:00:00] By the pond | I saw myself running to the pond at night, shouting that he didn't understand me, that he always belittled me, making me angry, and then I ran away. I heard him say, \"I can never give you these.\" I replied, \"Who said I want them?\" He countered, \"Do what Lina does.\" I got very angry and started arguing with him.\n[1960-02-05T20:05:00] By the pond | I saw the lifeless, dull old apartment buildings with peeling paint, doors covered in scratches, and everyday items that were broken, worn, and unchanging. I thought, but in reality Antonio knew me too well. The more I was drawn to Lina's house, the more it became a magical place, filled with everything I wanted—an entirely different world from the house where we grew up.\n[1960-02-10T16:00:00] Small Room | I would sometimes speak out loud the contents of the book, letting her listen as she sat on the small folding bed, while I sat at the desk. I recited it, and she checked each line. At that moment, I felt even more that the relationship between her and the book had changed. She became timid, no longer commanding me or imposing her rhythm on me. When she looked at the textbook and listened to my recitation, if she sensed I was wrong, she would correct me in various subtle ways.\n[1960-02-10T16:10:00] Small room | I know, for example, that chemistry was extremely boring to me. With a sharp glance, she could, with just a few simple comments, lift me out of my daze. I saw her flip through only half a page of the philosophy textbook, and yet she could very magically connect the ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras, the Russian chemist Mendeleev's periodic table, and the human intellect's ability to impose order on chaos. I thought she seemed unaware that she didn't need to exert much effort to understand the book, a talent that, as before, I noticed.\n[1960-02-10T16:15:00] Small room | I saw once when she closed the book in annoyance, and said irritably. I heard \"Enough!\"  \n\"Why?\"  \n\"Because I'm tired, always the same thing: inside small things, even smaller things pop up, and outside big things, even bigger ones constrain it. I'll just go make dinner.\"\n[1960-02-10T16:20:00] Small Room | I was fascinated by the trains moving along the tracks, the hazy outline of Mount Vesuvius, the new Mergellina without trees or shops, the streets with few vehicles, the women carrying shopping bags, and the children clinging tightly to their skirts. I thought that although what I was learning had little to do with the size of things, it was clearly annoying her, maybe even frightening her. Perhaps her own learning ability frightened her, and she had retreated. Where had she retreated to?\n[1960-02-15T10:00:00] Lina's New House | I know Lina rarely goes out, unless Stefano asks her to, or if he requests her company for a while. Even then, she just walks to the store — a place less than five hundred meters from her home. I thought about how, after she got married, she was even more lonely than when she was single. But the role of a wife seemed to have locked her inside a glass container, like a sailboat sailing in a sea where no one approached, or rather, sailing without any sea at all.\n[1960-02-15T11:00:00] Lina's New House | I realized the main use of the phone was for shopping. During this time, she rarely went out to let the scars on her face fade, but she kept shopping obsessively. I know she just needs to sign her name: Lina Calaci, first and last, just as Professor Oliviero taught her. When she signed, she did it like practicing calligraphy, with a focused smile on her face. She didn't even check the goods, as if the words she wrote on the paper were more important than the items being delivered.\n[1960-02-20T16:00:00] Lina's New Home | I saw her buy a large photo album with a green cover decorated with flowers, filled with photos from their wedding. Once, I faintly recognized Nino in one of the pictures. I saw the photo with Alfonso Carracci and Pinochia, and Nino appeared on the right, but the picture wasn't complete—it only captured his bangs, nose, and mouth.\n[1960-02-20T16:05:00] Lina's New House | I heard \"Can I have this photo?\" I mustered the courage to ask, but I wasn't very sure.  \n\"I can't see you in the photo.\"  \n\"I'm here, only my back.\"  \n\"Okay, if you want it, I'll print you a copy.\"  \nSuddenly, I changed my mind. \"No, never mind.\"\n[1960-03-01 07:00:00] Street | I saw it, but regardless, these two unfortunate people still had someone to rely on. Now, no matter the season, whether it was raining, sunny, or windy, every morning their son Enzo would drive a horse-drawn cart to Mergellina to sell vegetables.\n[1960-03-01 07:05:00] Street | I saw that he had grown into a strong young man, looking sturdy and healthy, with curly golden hair and blue eyes. I thought that at this moment, Enzo was nothing like the Enzo who had thrown stones at us.\n[1960-03-01 07:06:00] Street | I saw that his voice was rough as he shouted to sell his goods.\n[1960-03-01 07:07:00] Street | I usually saw his goods were very good, and he proudly shouted them out. I thought his movements were steady, his service very attentive, making him seem trustworthy and reliable.\n[1960-03-01 07:10:00] Street | I saw him measuring things with skill. I liked the agility with which he found the star on the balance beam, and I enjoyed listening to the sound of the sliding weight moving along the iron rod.\n[1960-03-01 07:11:00] Street | I saw him neatly wrapping potatoes or fruits in paper and placing them in Mrs. Spagnuolo's, Melina's, or my mother's basket.",

    "text": "[1960-03-01T20:00:00] Lina's New House | I saw Lina place the projector on the dining table, take down a painting of a stormy sea from the wall, and skillfully insert the film. She lowered the blinds, and soon images began to appear on the white wall. I saw something truly amazing: the images were in color, and they lasted only a few minutes. I saw again the scene of her wedding: she walked into the church with her father Fernando's arm, then she and Stefano arrived on the open space in front of the church, they happily strolled through the park, and finally, they shared a long [intimate moment].\n[1960-03-01T20:05:00] Lina's New Home | I saw myself being photographed twice. The first time was on the open ground in front of the church, next to Antonio, looking clumsy and tense, my face hidden behind my glasses; the second time was when I was sitting with Nino at the table, and I almost didn't recognize myself: I was smiling, gracefully waving my hands and arms, fixing my hair, playing with my mother's bracelet. I thought that the first time I read it, what shocked me most was myself. I looked so refined and beautiful.\n[1960-03-01T20:06:00] Lina's New Home | I heard that, in fact, Lina also sighed and said, \"Look at you, you're so photogenic.\"  \n\"What are you talking about!\" I lied.  \n\"That's the way you look when you're happy.\"\n[1960-03-01T20:10:00] Lina's New House | I saw Nino leave the hall, and then Marcello and Michele burst in, side by side, both tall and wearing tuxedos, their muscles clearly visible from their weightlifting at the gym. At that moment, Nino lowered his head and slipped away, bumping into Marcello's arm on his way out. Marcello suddenly turned around, his face showing the look of a bully, but Nino didn't care at all, disappearing without looking back.\n[1960-03-01T20:11:00] Lina's New House | I saw that Nino was very frail, which made him seem even taller, at least five centimeters taller than the two brothers— they were already tall enough. Nino's delicate appearance contrasted sharply with the self-assured, strong, and masculine presence of the Solara brothers. What I'm thinking about isn't what's most unforgettable for me. More precisely, what shocked me the most was Nino's indifference toward them. The arrogance and self-importance of the Solara brothers were normal, but Nino's distracted arrogance, bumping into Marcello without the slightest concern—this was abnormal, even a bit excessive.\n[1960-03-01T20:12:00] Lina's New House | I thought of how I had looked at him with reverence, how he was like a ascetic prince, able to intimidate Marcello and Michele with just a glance, though he hadn't even bothered to look at them directly. At that moment, I wished, in the video, he would do something he had never done in reality: take me away.\n[1960-03-01T20:13:00] Lina's New Home | I heard that only at this moment, Lina noticed Nino, and she asked curiously, \"Is this the man sitting at the same table as you and Alfonso Carracci?\"  \n\"Yes, don't you recognize him? He's Nino's older son.\"  \n\"Is that the one who kissed you when you were in Ischia?\"  \n\"That was really foolish.\"  \n\"Good thing you realized it.\"  \n\"Why do you say that?\"\n[1960-03-01T20:14:00] Lina's New Home | I heard her say, \"He doesn't even know who he is anymore.\"\nTo change her impression, I said, \"He's about to graduate from high school, and he's the best student in the school.\"\n\"Is that why you like him?\"\n\"Of course not!\"\n\"Leave him alone, Elena. Antonio is way better than him.\"\n[1960-03-01T20:15:00] Lina's New Home | \"I heard 'Do you really think so?'\"\n\"I said, this guy's dry, not good-looking, and so arrogant.\" When I heard those three adjectives, I felt it was an insult. I almost blurted out: Not at all, he's handsome! His eyes were full of fire—you didn't see that, and I felt sorry for you.\n[1960-03-01T20:16:00] Lina's New House | I heard myself saying gloomily, \"When we were in elementary school, I used to like him, but now I don't anymore.\"\n[1960-04-01 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw the sewing supply store suddenly appear—Carmela had started working there as a salesperson. I saw that I felt the entire Mergellina was full of life.\n[1960-04-01 10:05:00] Sewing Supplies Store | I saw a young tailor expanding his shop. I knew the shopkeeper was ambitious, wanting to turn the store into a tailor's for the wealthy.\n[1960-04-01 10:10:00] Auto Repair Shop | I know that Melina's son Antonio works at the auto repair shop, thanks to the son of the previous boss, Signor Glacchio — a capable man who wants to turn the auto repair shop into a small motorized bicycle factory.\n[1960-04-01 10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw that, in general, everything was in a state of pending development. I thought, as if I had gathered all my strength, to change my old appearance, to dissolve all the past grudges, tensions, and ugliness, and to present a new face.\n[1960-05-15 17:00:00] Small Park | I saw myself and Lina studying Latin in the small park. I saw the space around us: the small fountain, the bushes, the small empty lot by the street had all changed.\n[1960-05-15 17:05:00] Small Park | I saw the steam roller hissing as it slowly rolled over the hot asphalt road, and the workers, some bare-chested and others in undershirts, were laying down the Mergellina on the road. I saw, I smelled the air filled with the scent of asphalt, and I saw the color of Mergellina had also changed.\n[1960-05-15 17:10:00] Small Park | I saw Camilla's brother Pasquale being called to cut down the trees behind the railway. I heard the sound of trees falling for several days when I saw them cutting down the woods.\n[1960-05-15 17:15:00] Small Park | I saw the trees trembling, emitting the scent of fresh wood and grass. I saw branches slicing through the sky, falling to the ground with a rustling sound, like a sigh.\n[1960-05-15 17:20:00] Small Park | I saw Pasquale and others sawing, chopping, and digging out the tree roots. I smelled the earthy scent of the tree roots, and the forest gradually disappeared, slowly giving way to a yellowed flat area.\n[1960-05-15 17:25:00] Small Park | I knew that Pasquale had luckily found the job because not long ago, a friend told him that someone had come to the Solara bar and was looking for some boys to cut down the tree in the center of San Gregorio Armeno square at night.\n[1960-05-15 17:26:00] Small Park | I know that although he didn't like Silvio Solara and his sons, because his father had been ruined in that bar. I thought about it, but since he had to support his family, he went.\n[1960-05-15 17:27:00] Small Park | I saw him return at dawn, exhausted. I saw the inside of my nose filled with the scent of fresh wood, crushed leaves, and the sea.\n[1960-05-15 17:28:00] Small Park | I knew that was how it worked, there would be a first time and then a second, and later he was called to do similar work again.\n[1960-05-15 17:30:00] Small Park | I saw him working on the construction site behind the railway now. Sometimes, we could see him working on the scaffolding in front of the new building. I saw the buildings rising higher and higher.\n[1960-05-15 17:31:00] Small Park | I sometimes saw him wearing a hat made of newspaper on his head, and during lunch he would eat a sandwich with sausage and fried egg under the sun.\n[1960-05-15 17:40:00] Small Park | I saw that when we were studying Latin, I was distracted and looking at Pasquale. I thought Lina would be very angry.\n[1960-05-15 17:45:00] Small Park | I know she knows all the endings of words, and she also knows many verb conjugations. What surprised me was that I quickly realized she already knew a lot of Latin.\n[1960-05-15 17:46:00] Small Park | I asked her carefully why she knew Latin, and she made a face as if she didn't want to waste time explaining. I heard her say, with some resentment, that when I was a freshman, she borrowed a Latin grammar book from the mobile library—Professor Ferraro's library, as it was called—because she was curious, and so she gave it a try.\n[1960-05-15 17:47:00] Small Park | I know that the library was a great resource for her.\n[1960-05-15 17:48:00] Small Park | I saw that as we were talking, she showed me all her library cards, a total of four: one was hers, one was under Rino's name, and two were under her parents' names.\n[1960-05-15 17:49:00] Small Park | I knew that each library card allowed borrowing one book, and she had four of them, so she could borrow four books. She finished reading all four in a week, returned them on the following Sunday, and then borrowed four more.\n[1960-05-15 18:00:00] Small Park | I never asked her what books she had read, what she was reading now. I thought, because we don't have time, we need to learn Latin.\n[1960-05-15 18:05:00] Small Park | I know she's testing me; if I can't answer, she'll get angry.\n[1960-05-15 18:06:00] Small Park | I remember once, she hit my arm hard. I saw her hands were thin and long.\n[1960-05-15 18:07:00] Small Park | I heard her not say sorry; she said that if I answered wrong again, she would hit me harder.\n[1960-05-15 18:10:00] Small Park | I saw her constantly looking up words above, not just the ones that appeared in the exercises, but whatever words came to her mind. I saw her fascinated by the Latin words, the Latin dictionary was thick, with many pages and heavy, something she had never seen before.\n[1960-05-15 18:15:00] Small Park | I saw that she still gave me homework, using the same tone she had learned from Teacher Oliviero. I heard her say that I had to translate thirty sentences every day: twenty from Latin to Italian, and another ten from Italian to Latin.\n[1960-05-15 18:20:00] Small Park | I saw that she could also do translations, but much faster than me.",

    "text": "[1960-06-04T08:00:00] School | I didn't see Lina the next day, but I unexpectedly met her husband. In a gloomy mood, I arrived at school in the morning. I thought about the hot weather, about how I hadn't studied, and how I'd barely slept the night before. School was simply unbearable.\n[1960-06-04T08:10:00] School | I looked for Nino under the school, hoping to go up the stairs with him and exchange a few words, but I didn't see him. I thought maybe he was wandering around the city with his girlfriend, or perhaps he was kissing her passionately in a dark movie theater on some morning, or maybe they were doing the things two people do in the woods of Capodimonte—things I'd done with Antonio these past few months.\n[1960-06-04T09:00:00] Classroom | I had my first class as chemistry, and the teacher called on me. I answered in a complete mess. I thought, who knows how many points the teacher gave me! But it was too late to make up for it—I might have to take a makeup exam in September.\n[1960-06-04T10:00:00] School corridor | I saw myself encountering Teacher Galiani in the corridor. She listened to me for a while, then suddenly left me and walked into the faculty office. I heard her speak to me calmly, her words essentially asking: What happened, Grego? Why aren't you studying properly anymore? I didn't know what to say, so I just said: Teacher, I am studying. I'm studying very hard. I swear to you.\n[1960-06-04T10:30:00] School restroom | I saw myself crying in the toilet for a long time, weeping for my bad luck. I thought I had nothing left, no longer possessing outstanding grades. I had always wanted to leave Antonio, but in the end, it was he who left me, and I had already begun to miss him.\n[1960-06-04T12:00:00] On the way home | I had a terrible headache, so I walked home. All along the way, I kept thinking about her. I know that since Lina became Mrs. Karaki, she has been becoming more and more like someone else. I thought to myself that she had used me—yes, used me—to seduce the Solara brothers, to take revenge on her husband, and then she showed me the pitiful condition of that injured man. All along the way, I kept asking myself: had she really become that way? If so, then she was no different from Giggia.\n[1960-06-04T13:00:00] Posillipo | I saw myself returning home, and the surprise waiting for me was that my mother didn't scold me. She had a stern face, and calmly told me. I heard \"Stefano asked me if I could accompany him to the tailor's shop in Rettifilo this afternoon.\" I know that because I often come home late, she always scolds me, suspecting that I've gone to see Antonio or that I've neglected some part of the complicated household chores. I thought at the time I hadn't understood, exhausted and discouraged as I was, my head swimming. Stefano? Stefano Carracci? He wanted me to go with him to Rettifilo?\n[1960-06-04T13:10:00] Posillipo | I heard my father jokingly ask from another room, \"Why didn't he go with his wife?\" \"What did the two of them do together? Play cards?\" I know my father is officially sick, but in reality he's busy selling things—things that are unclear and hard to explain.\n[1960-06-04T13:11:00] Posillipo | I saw my mother make an exasperated gesture. I heard her say that Lina might have something going on, that we should be more hospitable to the Carichis, and that some people will never be satisfied.\n[1960-06-04T13:12:00] Posillipo | I knew, in reality, my father was very pleased: getting on well with the boss of Capodimonte meant being able to buy food on credit and delay payments. He had just been joking before; it had been a while now, and he would always take any opportunity to imply, in a roundabout way, that Stefano was lax in his duties.\n[1960-06-04T13:13:00] Posillipo | I sometimes saw him ask during meals, \"What is Kalachi doing? Does he only like watching TV?\" Then he would laugh at himself. I knew my mother had a sixth sense about this, so I said seriously, \"It's still early, let them take their time. What else can we expect?\" I thought it was easy to guess what he meant—that is, why the two of them didn't have children yet? Was Stefano capable, after all? In fact, when it came to talking about this matter—whether Calafiore was capable or not—she enjoyed it more than my father did. She thought, even though their family was rich, what could they do about it?\n[1960-06-04T13:15:00] Posillipo | I saw that the meal was already set on the table, and they were waiting for me to eat. My father sat down, his smile sly, and continued teasing my mother. \"I heard you say, 'I've never said to you, \"Sorry, I'm tired tonight, let's play cards?\"'\" \"Yes, because you're not a proper person.\" \"Do you want me to become a proper person?\" \"Just be a little more proper, don't be so exaggerated.\" \"Then I'll be a proper person tonight, like Stefano.\" \"I told you, don't be too exaggerated.\"\n[1960-06-04T13:16:00] Posillipo | I hated how they played off each other like that. They spoke like they were certain my brother and sisters couldn't understand, or maybe they were sure we could grasp the deeper meaning, but they thought this was the right way to teach us how to be men and women.\n[1960-06-04T13:20:00] Posillipo | I saw the damp corners of the ceiling, the peeling paint on the walls, the smell of food, and everything else I didn't want to see. I thought about how my own questions had driven me to the edge, I wanted to scream, to throw the plates out the window, to run away and never have to see Posillipo people again.\n[1960-06-04T13:21:00] Posillipo | I realized how foolish it was to lose Antonio! I had already regretted it too much, and I wished he would forgive me. If I had to take the makeup exam in September, I told myself I wouldn't go, and if I failed, I'd marry him.\n[1960-06-04T13:22:00] Posillipo | I thought, and then Lina appeared in my mind. What has she become now? What tone does she use when talking to the Solara brothers? What is she thinking inside? A life filled with humiliation and pain must have made her so terrible.\n[1960-06-04T15:00:00] Posillipo | I thought about how I had spent the entire afternoon lost in random, fragmented thoughts. Stefano's request made me anxious—I didn't know how to inform my friend, and what exactly her husband wanted me to do.\n[1960-06-04T15:30:00] Posillipo | I thought about the bath I took in the new house's bathtub, chemistry class, the philosopher Empedocles, going to school and then dropping out, and finally, my heart grew cold and I felt trapped. Yes, me and Lina would never be the girls waiting outside for Nino. We both lacked something difficult to describe but crucial, something you could see from afar just by looking at her, that kind of aura, which you either have or you don't, something you can't acquire by studying Latin, Greek, or philosophy, nor by earning money selling sausages and shoes.\n[1960-06-04T16:00:00] Courtyard | I saw Stefano calling me in the courtyard, and I ran down to see him, his face full of sorrow. He asked me to go with him to the tailor's shop to retrieve the photo that was displayed in the window without permission. I heard him say, \"Please, please come with me!\" in a sweet, intimate way.\n[1960-06-04T16:05:00] Convertible car | I saw and then he said nothing, just had me get into his convertible. We sped away in the hot wind.\n[1960-06-04T16:15:00] Convertible car | As soon as we came out of Mergellina, he started talking to me, never stopping until we reached the tailor's shop. When he spoke in his dialect, his tone was gentle, without swearing or mockery. He asked me to do him a favor, but he didn't tell me right away what it was. He just stammered, saying that if I helped him, it would be helping my friend. I heard him and then he began to talk about Lina: \"She's so smart, so beautiful, but she's naturally rebellious. Things have to go her way, or she'll torment you. Elena, you don't know how much pain I'm going through. Maybe you do, but you only know what she's told you. Now listen to what I have to say.\"\n[1960-06-04T16:16:00] Convertible car | I heard her say, \"Lina thinks I only care about money—maybe that's true, but everything I do is for this family, for her brother, her father, and all of them. Did I do wrong? You've studied a lot, tell me, was I wrong? What exactly does she want me to do, to go back to living a poor life like before? Are the Solara brothers the only ones who can make money? Are we supposed to hand over Mergellina to them? If you say I'm wrong, I won't argue with you, I'll admit my mistake right away.\"\n[1960-06-04T16:17:00] Convertible car | \"I heard myself say, 'But I had to argue with her. She didn't want me, she'd told me and kept telling me she didn't want me. Making her realize I was her husband was a war. Since the marriage, my life had become unbearable. Seeing her in the morning, seeing her at night, sleeping next to her but unable to make her feel how much I loved her, how strong I was—this was a terrible thing.'\"\n[1960-06-04T16:18:00] Convertible car | I saw his big hands on the steering wheel, his face. I saw his eyes become bright, filled with tears.\n[1960-06-04T16:19:00] Convertible car | I saw him admit that on their wedding night he had hit her, that he had been forced to do it, that she had constantly pressured him, making him brutal, forcing him to become someone she never wanted to be.\n[1960-06-04T16:20:00] Convertible car | I heard him say this, and he spoke with a tone almost like fear: \"I was forced to do it. I hit her again. She shouldn't have dressed like that to go to Capodimonte. But there was a force inside her that wouldn't let her give in to me. It was a very evil force, one that made it impossible for you to calmly face her. It was a poison.\"\n[1960-06-04T16:21:00] Convertible car | I heard her say, \"She's not pregnant, you saw, right? It's been months and nothing has happened. Relatives, friends, and customers all smiled and asked me, 'Any good news?' I had to say, 'What good news?' I pretended not to understand. If I did understand, I'd have to answer that question. What could I possibly say? Some things you know, but you can't talk about.\"\n[1960-06-04T16:22:00] Convertible car | I heard myself say, \"It was that stubbornness, the same kind of stubbornness that killed the child in her belly. Elena, she did it on purpose, to make people believe I didn't know how to be a man, to humiliate me in front of everyone. What do you think? Am I being too dramatic? You don't know how much it means to me that you're listening to me now.\"\n[1960-06-04T16:23:00] Convertible car | I thought about how I didn't know how to answer him. I was stunned; I had never heard a man speak like that before. He spoke in dialect, and even when he was talking about his own violent actions, his words were full of emotion, unguarded, like the emotions expressed in some songs. I still didn't understand why he had acted that way.\n[1960-06-04T16:24:00] Convertible car | After seeing it, he explained to me what he wanted me to do. For Lina's sake, he wanted me to join him and persuade her. I knew he was saying that Lina needed help, that she had to understand she should be a wife, not an enemy—that was very necessary. He asked me to persuade her to go help with the cash register at the newly opened Capodimonte.\n[1960-06-04T16:25:00] Convertible car | I thought, but in order to achieve this goal, he didn't necessarily have to confide in me about these personal details of his life. Perhaps he thought that Lina had already told me everything in detail, so he had to tell me the other side of the story. Maybe he didn't really want to open his heart to his wife's best friend, it was just a momentary impulse. Or maybe he guessed that if he moved me, I would bring up the matter with Lina and then move her.\n[1960-06-04T16:26:00] Convertible car | The one thing I was certain of was that I was getting more and more absorbed. Gradually, I began to like that open, very private kind of confession. But first, I had to admit that it made me happy that he thought I was important. When he said in his own words the things he suspected—things I had always suspected too, that Lina possessed some mysterious power that allowed her to do anything, even prevent herself from getting pregnant—I felt that he believed I had a good influence on Lina, that I could \"set her straight.\" I felt he was trying to please me.",

    "text": "[1960-06-04T16:30:00] Rettifilo Street | I saw that we had arrived at the tailor's shop and got out of the car. I heard myself confidently telling him in Italian that I would do my best to help him and make them happy. I thought of how his approval brought me comfort.\n[1960-06-04T16:31:00] In front of the tailor's shop window | I saw it, but as soon as we arrived at the window of the tailor's shop, I became very anxious. We both stopped to look at Lina's photo, which was in a frame and placed among fabrics of various colors.\n[1960-06-04T16:32:00] In front of the tailor's shop window | I saw her sitting with one leg crossed over the other, her wedding dress pulled up slightly, revealing her shoes and ankles. Her head rested on the palm of one hand, her gaze intense and passionate, boldly looking into the camera, a crown of orange blossoms still on her head. I thought the photographer was very lucky, he had captured that spirit within Lina—the kind of strength Stefano talked about. I seemed to understand, and for this, Lina herself couldn't do anything.\n[1960-06-04T16:33:00] At the tailor's shop door | I looked at him with admiration and apology, then turned to tell Stefano that this was exactly what we'd been talking about, but he opened the door and gestured for me to go in first.\n[1960-06-04T16:35:00] Tailor's shop | I noticed his tone had changed, completely different from how he spoke to me before. When he spoke to the female seamstress, his tone was harsh. He said he was Lina's husband—he used that exact term. He also said he was in business, but he never expected to advertise in this way. I heard him say, \"You're a beautiful woman. What would your husband say if I took your photo and put it between the cheese and the sausage?\" He asked the tailor to return the photo to him.\n[1960-06-04T16:40:00] Tailor's shop | I saw the female seamstress was somewhat flustered. She tried to defend herself, but finally gave up. She looked regretful and said she had only meant well, then explained the reasons why she felt sorry. I heard her talk about three or four things, and over time, these stories became a small legend in our Mergellina. During the days when the photo was displayed in the window, many people came to ask about the young woman in the wedding dress: Prince Renato Caro Soli from Egypt, the director Vittorio De Sica, and a journalist from Il Messaggero— he wanted to talk to Lina and take a swimsuit photo of her, just like those beauty queens.\n[1960-06-04T16:45:00] Tailor's shop | I saw the seamstress say she refused to reveal Lina's address to anyone, even though Renato Carozone and Vittorio D'Ascia were prominent figures; it would have been impolite to refuse them. I thought about how, the more the seamstress spoke, the softer Stefano became. He grew kinder and more approachable, hoping she would go into more detail about those things.\n[1960-06-04T17:00:00] Convertible car | I saw that when we left with the photo, his mood completely changed. On the way home, his muttering dispelled the pain he'd felt before. He was in a good mood and began talking about Lina in a proud tone, as if he had acquired a rare treasure and felt very honored. He once again asked me to help him.\n[1960-06-04T17:30:00] Mydownstairs is translated as \"my downstairs\" or \"the area downstairs from my home.\" However, since the instruction specifies to keep proper names unchanged and not to translate them, and there are no proper names in this sentence, the translation would be:\n\nMy downstairs | I saw him at my building's entrance, and before I even got out of the car, he kept asking me again and again to promise that I would try to make Lina see which way was right and which was wrong. I thought that in his words, Lina was no longer an uncontrollable person, but rather a precious gas he possessed, sealed in a closed container.\n[1960-06-05T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that in the following days, Stefano would talk about Renato Caro and Vittorio Diciacca to everyone, including those in Capodimonte. Later, this reached the ears of Lina's mother, Nunzia. Throughout her life, she would repeatedly tell people that if that woman from Rettifilo hadn't kept silent or if fate hadn't made her daughter marry Stefano Carracci at sixteen, her daughter might have become a singer and actress, maybe even appeared in \"An Italian Wedding,\" been on TV, or even become an Egyptian princess.\n[1960-06-20T10:00:00] School | I knew my chemistry teacher was being very generous with me, perhaps because of something Galiani had said to her, which had changed her attitude. She passed me in chemistry. I got seven in the humanities subjects; six in the sciences; I passed religious philosophy; and for the first time, I got eight in ethics, which showed that the priest and several teachers hadn't truly forgiven me. I thought about how I felt sad, and the argument I had with my religious philosophy teacher about the role of the Holy Spirit was proof of my arrogance, which made me very unhappy.\n[1960-06-20T12:00:00] Posillipo | I realized I began to regret not listening to Alfonso Carracci's advice—back then he had tried to stop me, and naturally I didn't get the scholarship. My mother was very angry, shouting that it was all because I'd wasted too much time hanging around with Antonio. I heard myself say that I never wanted to read again, and that upset her. She raised her hand to slap me, but then worried about my glasses, so she ran to get the laundry pestle to hit me.\n[1960-06-20T13:00:00] Posillipo | I thought that, in general, it was a very bad time, and it was getting worse and worse!\n[1960-06-21T09:00:00] School | The only thing that made me feel a little better was this: that morning, when I went to school to check my grades, the janitor came over and handed me a package, saying it was left for me by Professor Galiani. Inside were all books, but not novels—rather, books on philosophical ideas. I thought it was a gesture of trust, but it wasn't enough to lift my spirits.\n[1960-06-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I tried to find him at my ex-boyfriend's house and at his workplace, but he always avoided me; I went to Capodimonte hoping to get help from Pinocchia. I realized I had been too worried, feeling that I was constantly making mistakes, and no matter what I did, I was always afraid I had done something wrong.\n[1960-06-25T11:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw her coldly tell me that her brother didn't want to see me anymore. From that day on, whenever we met on the street, she would turn her face away, pretending not to see me.\n[1960-06-30T08:00:00] Posillipo | I realized I wouldn't have to go to school anymore, and getting up in the morning became an extremely painful thing for me, as if my head was about to explode. At first, I tried reading a few pages of the book that Teacher Galiani had lent me, but I couldn't get into it, understanding only a little bit.\n[1960-07-01T10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw myself quickly starting to borrow some novels from the mobile library again, and I read them one after another. But over time, I found that I wasn't getting much enjoyment from these books. I thought of the thrilling life described in the book, the profound conversations, that illusory life was more tempting than my real one.\n[1960-07-05T10:00:00] School | I would sometimes go to the school to escape the dull reality, hoping to meet Nino, who was preparing for the college entrance exam. On the day of the Greek written test, I waited for him patiently for several hours.\n[1960-07-05T13:00:00] At the school gate | When the examinees with backpacks started to trickle out one by one, the girl appeared — the same clear-eyed and beautiful girl I'd seen before, the one who had looked up at Nino and kissed him.\n[1960-07-05T13:01:00] At the school gate | I saw her standing a few meters away from me. In that instant, a picture of the two of us standing together flashed through my mind — like two photos in a product catalog — Salvatore's son walking out of the school gate, and this is how we appeared to him. I thought to myself that I was ugly and disgraceful, and I left silently.\n[1960-07-10T15:00:00] Lina's house | I ran to Lina's house, hoping for some comfort, but I knew I was wrong even before her. I thought of the foolish thing I had done: I hadn't told her that I had gone with Stefano to get back her photo.\n[1960-07-10T15:05:00] Lina's house | Why didn't I say anything? Was I content with playing the role of a mediator? Did my husband suggest that I mediate between them, and by hiding from her the fact that I went to Rettifilo with Stefano, I could play that role better? I was afraid of letting Stefano down, yet I hadn't realized that I had already betrayed Lina? No, I didn't know.\n[1960-07-10T15:06:00] Lina's house | The one thing I was certain of was that this wasn't my real thought. More accurately, my hesitation first turned into an act of pretended inattention, and then I was sure: because I didn't tell her what had happened right away, the situation had become more complicated, and it was too late to make amends. It's so easy to offend someone! I tried to find excuses, some convincing ones for her, but even I couldn't be convinced by them. I felt the serious consequences of my actions, and I remained silent.\n[1960-07-10T15:10:00] Lina's house | I saw another side of her; she acted as if she had never known about my meeting with Stefano. She always welcomed me warmly, letting me take a bath in her tub and use her cosmetics. But she rarely commented on the stories I told her. Instead, she preferred to talk to me about celebrity gossip she had read in magazines.\n[1960-07-10T15:15:00] Lina's house | I saw that she no longer told me her thoughts, or her secret plans. If I mentioned the physical violence on her, I would talk about those incidents, trying to get her to speak about the reasons behind Stefano's terrible behavior. If I said that he had gotten worse now, perhaps because he wanted Lina's help to deal with all his problems, she would look at me sarcastically, shrug her shoulders, and then change the subject.\n[1960-07-10T15:20:00] Lina's house | I realized not long after that, although she didn't want to cut me off, she had already made up her mind not to trust me anymore. Maybe she really knew about that thing, and no longer saw me as a friend she could rely on? I reduced the number of times I went to her house, hoping she would notice my absence, ask why, and then we could clear things up. But she seemed not to notice anything unusual. Later, I couldn't help but go to her house more often again, and she showed neither happiness nor unhappiness about it.\n[1960-07-20T14:00:00] Lina's house | The day I saw July, I came to her house in a particularly bad mood. I sat on the sofa in her dining room and drank cold almond syrup. I felt annoyed by the heat, the train's rumbling, and the sweat—everything was making me restless. I knew I hadn't told her anything about Nino, or about Nino's girlfriend, because I couldn't help it—everyone knew— I no longer shared my innermost secrets with her. She was as warm as ever, preparing almond syrup for me.\n[1960-07-20T14:10:00] Lina's House | I watched her moving about the house in silence. I felt angry thinking about her, because she could move freely within this maze-like and oppressive situation, could stand firm in her stance and fight back, and still remain hidden and unexposed. This ability made me angry.",

    "text": "[1960-07-20T14:11:00] Lina's house | I looked at her stomach, imagining a battle going on there every day and every night—Stefano trying to force a life into it, while she struggled to destroy that life. I know I remember her husband once told me that Lina's energy was like a spring inside a dangerous weapon. I thought about how much longer she could hold on, but I didn't dare ask the question too directly. I knew she would think I shouldn't have asked.\n[1960-07-20T14:30:00] Lina's house | I saw that soon after, Pinocchia arrived, ostensibly a visit from a sister-in-law, but in reality it wasn't. Ten minutes later, Rino appeared. Right before our eyes, he and Pinocchia engaged in [intimate behavior], which went too far. I exchanged a mocking glance with Lina.\n[1960-07-20T14:40:00] Lina's house | I saw Pinocchia say she wanted to look at the view from the window. Rino followed her into a room, and they stayed inside for more than half an hour, closing the door behind them. Lina told me that this kind of thing happened often, her tone filled with resentment and sarcasm. I thought about how bitterly jealous I was of this couple's ease and confidence: they had no fear, no worries at all.\n[1960-07-20T15:15:00] Lina's house | I saw them when they appeared again, and they seemed even happier than when they had first arrived. Rino went to the kitchen to get some food, then talked with his sister about the shoe store. He said the business with the shoes was getting better and better. He tried to get some good advice from his sister so he could make a good impression on the Solara brothers.\n[1960-07-20T15:20:00] Lina's house | \"I heard that 'You know, Marcello and Michele want to hang your photo in the shoe shop on Piazza Martiri.' He suddenly spoke to Lina in a flattering tone. 'I think it's inappropriate,' Pinocchia said. 'Why?' Rino asked.\"\n[1960-07-20T15:21:00] Elena's House | I heard myself say, \"What do you think? If she could, wouldn't Lina have put that photo in the new Capodimonte? She runs the place, doesn't she? If it were me running the store in Martiri Square, wouldn't I be the one to decide what goes in the shop?\"\n[1960-07-20T15:22:00] Lina's house | I thought about what she said, as if she was placing Lina's rights above all else, never allowing her rights to be violated by her brother. In fact, we all knew that she was just protecting her own future. She didn't want to rely on Stefano anymore; she wanted to leave Capodimonte, and she wanted to be a manager at the store in the city center.\n[1960-07-20T15:23:00] Lina's house | I knew that Rino and Michele had been locked in a bitter struggle for control of the shoe store, a conflict fueled by pressure from their girlfriends, who stirred things up behind the scenes: Rino wanted Pinocchia to run the shop, while Michele insisted on letting Giggia take charge.\n[1960-07-20T15:24:00] Lina's house | I know, but Pinocchia was stronger than Giggia. She felt she could definitely come out on top. She knew she could combine her boyfriend's and her brother's authority. Therefore, in every situation, she showed that she had undergone a fundamental transformation: she had left that Mergellina behind, and now she was figuring out what suited the taste of the customers in the city center, and what didn't.\n[1960-07-20T15:25:00] Lina's house | I saw that Rino was worried about his sister's reaction, but Lina showed no concern. He looked at his watch, indicating he was very busy, and with a very foresighted tone, he emphasized it. I heard, \"I think that photo has tremendous commercial value.\"\n[1960-07-20T15:26:00] Lina's House | I saw that, then he [intimate act] with Pinocchia, but she dodged, indicating she didn't agree with him, and he immediately ran away.\n[1960-07-20T15:30:00] Lina's House | I saw that we girls were still there. Pinocchia hoped to end the conversation through my authority; she pouted and asked me. \"I heard, 'Elena, what do you think? Do you think Lina's photo should be hung in the shop on Piazza Martiri?'\"\n[1960-07-20T15:31:00] Lina's house | I said in Italian. \"I heard that Stefano would make a decision. He specifically went to the dressmaker's shop and had her take the photo down from the window, so I ruled out the possibility of him agreeing to this.\"\n[1960-07-20T15:32:00] Lina's house | I heard Pinocchio was very happy, almost shouting, \"Oh my God! You're amazing! Elena!\"\nI hoped Lina would express her opinion, but there was a long silence. Finally, she just said to me, \"You're wrong. Are you willing to bet? Stefano will agree.\"\n\"He won't.\"\n\"He will.\"\n[1960-07-20T15:33:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"What do you want to bet?\"  \n\"If you lose, your college entrance exam score can't be lower than eight on average.\"\n[1960-07-20T15:34:00] Lina's house | I saw myself looking at her awkwardly. I knew we hadn't talked about the fact that I had barely passed with a lot of effort. I thought she knew nothing about it, but she already knew everything, and now she was reproaching me. I thought that's what she meant: you don't have the ability, you can only get low grades; if she had taken the exam, her results wouldn't have been so bad. She was trying hard to fix my role— I should spend every day buried in books and studying; while she had money, nice clothes, a house, a TV, a car, everything, and could give others everything too.\n[1960-07-20T15:35:00] Lina's house | I asked, my voice filled with resentment, \"What if you lose?\" I saw, suddenly, her gaze had become as deep and menacing as two gun barrels.\n[1960-07-20T15:36:00] Lina's house | I heard myself say, \"Then I'll enroll in a private school and start over. I swear I'll get my diploma, and my grades will be as good as yours, even better!\"\n[1960-07-20T15:37:00] Lina's house | I thought I was just like you, even better than you. Is that what she was thinking? I felt all the suffering I've endured during this period—Antonio, Nino, and all the misfortunes in my life—dissolved with a long sigh.\n[1960-07-20T15:38:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Are you serious?\"  \n\"Have you ever seen someone joke during a bet?\"\n[1960-07-20T15:39:00] Lina's House | I heard Pinocchia interject, her tone a bit domineering. \"Lina, don't do something crazy like usual. You have this new Capodimonte, and Stefano can't hold it up by himself.\" She immediately restrained herself, her voice now tinged with more feigned sweetness, \"I just want to know when I'll be an aunt.\"\n[1960-07-20T15:40:00] Lina's house | I thought about the way she spoke with such insincere tone, but I could still detect a hint of resentment in her voice. Pinochia wanted to say: You're already married, my brother gave everything for you, now you should do what you should do. You've become Mrs. Kalachi, so what's the point in closing yourself off now?\n[1960-07-20T15:41:00] Lina's house | I think about how you're now guarding your stomach so carefully, not wanting to be in a state of pregnancy. What does that mean? Lina, is it possible that you'll keep sabotaging everything? When will you stop all this? When will your energy weaken a bit, when will it disperse, like a drowsy guard who finally falls asleep? When will you open up, work at the checkout counter in the new neighborhood, your belly growing bigger and bigger, making Pinocchia your aunt? And when will you give me a break, letting me live my own life?\n[1960-07-20T15:42:00] Lina's house | \"I don't know,\" Lina answered.\n\"Do I have to become a mother first?\" Pinochia laughed.\n\"If you keep clinging to Rino like that, it might actually happen.\" I saw her gaze become scattered yet deep.\n[1960-07-20T15:43:00] Lina's house | I saw them start a small argument, but I could no longer make out what they were saying.\n[1960-07-25T09:00:00] Stationery Store | I saw that in order to comfort my mother, I had no choice but to find a summer job. Naturally, I went to the stationery store owner. She received me as if welcoming a school teacher or a university graduate.\n[1960-07-25T09:10:00] Stationery Store | I saw her call out a few children who were playing behind the shop. A few girls embraced me, kissed me, and wanted to play with me for a while. I said I was looking for a job, and the shopkeeper said that in order for the girls to play with such a smart and kind girl like me, she would have me take them to the \"Seaside Park,\" and there was no need to wait until August. I heard \"When was that?\" I asked.  \n\"Next week.\"  \n\"That's great!\"  \n\"I'll give you a little more salary, a bit higher than last year.\"",

    "text": "[1960-07-25T12:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that I had finally heard some good news. I happily went home, and my mother said I was as lucky as usual: I could go swimming in the sea, lie in the sun — this wasn't even work! I thought about it, but those words didn't change my mood.\n[1960-07-26T10:00:00] Teacher Oliviero's front door | I felt better, so the next day I went to visit Professor Oliviero. I was a bit reluctant because I had to tell her that my grades that semester weren't very good, but I had to go see her anyway, and I also needed to carefully remind her to get me the textbooks for the second year. I thought, Lina's message would make her happy—she had found a good place to settle, and she had plenty of free time to continue her studies. I might be able to read in the teacher's eyes how she reacted to the news, and I hoped this would ease my unease—the unease Lina had caused me.\n[1960-07-26T10:10:00] Outside Teacher Oliviero's house | I knocked on the door many times, but no one came to open it. I asked her neighbor and then questioned people in the community again. About an hour later, I went back and knocked again, but still no one answered. No one had seen her leave—on the street, at Mergellina, or in the store, I didn't see her anywhere.\n[1960-07-26T11:00:00] Teacher Oliviero's house | I saw that she lived alone, she was quite old, and her health wasn't good. I went back to ask her neighbor, a lady living across the hall, to call her son to help. The young man came and entered the teacher's apartment through the balcony. His house had a balcony that connected to one of the teacher's windows.\n[1960-07-26T11:10:00] Teacher Oliviero's house | I saw him find her on the kitchen floor, lying in her pajamas. They called a doctor, and the doctor said she had to be hospitalized immediately.\n[1960-07-26T11:30:00] The building downstairs from Teacher Oliviero | I saw them carry the teacher downstairs, and I bent down to greet her. The medical staff put her into the ambulance, which screeched off with a wail. I saw her messy clothes and swollen face. She used to always dress neatly to go to school, and now her eyes looked frightened.\n[1960-08-01T15:00:00] Mergellina | I remember that summer was extremely hot, and many people with weak constitutions couldn't stand it. In the afternoon, I heard Melina's children calling for their mother, their voices filled with worry. Their cries went on and on, and I decided to go out and see what was happening.\n[1960-08-01T15:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that I had met Pinocchio, her eyes full of tears, nervously saying that Melina was missing. Antonio also arrived out of breath, his face pale, and without even looking at me, he ran off.\n[1960-08-01T15:30:00] Mergellina | I saw that soon half of the Mergellina group were searching for Melina. When Stefano started his convertible, he was still wearing the Capodimonte uniform, and Pinocchia was sitting next to him. He slowly drove forward, scanning as he went. I ran back and forth behind Antonio, saying nothing.\n[1960-08-01T16:00:00] Pond | I saw that in the end we ran to the pond, and we both went into the grass to look for his mother. His cheeks were sunken, and he had dark circles under his eyes. I took hold of one of his hands to comfort him, but he pushed me away and said something unpleasant. I heard, \"Let me go! You're not even a woman!\"\n[1960-08-01T16:05:00] Pond | I felt a lump in my chest, and just then we saw Melina, sitting in the water to cool off. She was silent, as she always was whenever she had a mental health episode in the past ten years—she would either scream or sing. I saw her face and neck emerge from the greenish water, her hair soaked and matted, her eyes red, her lips covered with small leaves and mud.\n[1960-08-01T16:30:00] Mergellina | I saw them bring her home, Antonio supporting her on one side and me on the other. Everyone felt relieved, calling her name, and she weakly waved her hand, greeting the people around her.\n[1960-08-01T16:35:00] Mergellina | I saw Lina at the gate, she wasn't going to look for Melina with me. I know she now lives in New Mergellina, somewhat isolated, and by the time the news reached her, it was already too late. I know she had a good relationship with Melina.\n[1960-08-01T16:36:00] Mergellina | What impressed me was this: everyone was cheerful at the time. Pinocchia ran over and shouted \"Mom!\" Stefano followed her, parking the car on the side of the road with the door open, looking relieved as well. Only Lina stood aside, her expression indescribable.\n[1960-08-01T16:37:00] Mergellina | I saw Melina, all dirty and her smile looked rather pale. Her wet clothes were covered in mud, and her body beneath them was extremely thin. When she greeted someone she knew, her movements were weak and lifeless.\n[1960-08-01T16:38:00] Mergellina | I thought that Lina had been deeply moved by the pitiful scene when that widow appeared. Not just moved, she was actually hurt, frightened, as if she herself were suffering the same humiliation.\n[1960-08-01T16:40:00] Mergellina | I saw that at this moment I had handed Melina over to her daughter, and then I went after Lina. I wanted to tell her about Professor Oliviero, and also wanted to tell her the nasty things Antonio had said. But I couldn't find her—she had already left.\n[1960-08-10T10:00:00] Lina's house | When I thought about seeing Lina again, I realized something was wrong with her—she also wanted me to feel defeated.\n[1960-08-10T10:05:00] Lina's House | I saw her force me to try on her clothes. I remember one morning when we were at her house, the atmosphere seemed light and playful on the surface, but in reality, she was full of hatred toward me, even though I told her I couldn't possibly fit those clothes.\n[1960-08-10T10:10:00] Elena's House | I heard her refusing to admit it, she said that all she needed to do was fix this part and adjust that one. I thought this game was a torment for me. She was taller and slimmer than me, and any piece of clothing she wore would make me look ridiculous if I put it on. Yet she was growing more and more annoyed with me, as if my appearance had offended her.\n[1960-08-10T10:15:00] Lina's house | I later heard her finally say, \"Enough!\" I saw her gaze and expression as if she had seen a ghost.\n[1960-08-10T10:16:00] Lina's house | I saw her shaking her head. I heard her trying to sound flippant as she told me that the night before, she had gone for ice cream with Pasquale and Pinocchia.\n[1960-08-10T10:17:00] Lina's house | I saw myself wearing only my underwear, helping her put the clothes back on the hanger. I heard, \"With Pasquale and Pinocchia?\"\n[1960-08-10T10:18:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n\"Did Stefano go too?\"\n\"I went alone.\"\n\"Did they invite you?\"\n\"No, I asked them to go.\"\n[1960-08-10T10:19:00] Lina's house | I saw her and she told me that she kept in touch with her girlhood friends, not just going out once, but the next day she had Borgo with Enzo and Pinochia. I saw her looking as if she wanted to surprise me.\n[1960-08-10T10:20:00] Lina's house | I saw her make a nonchalant expression. I heard, \"Did he go alone too?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"What did Stefano say?\"\n[1960-08-10T10:21:00] Lina's house | \"I heard her say, 'Getting married doesn't mean I have to live like an old lady. If he wanted to go out with me, he could, but he's always too tired in the evening, so I go out alone.'\"  \n\"How did it feel?\"  \n\"I was happy.\"\n[1960-08-10T10:22:00] Lina's house | I wished she could see my displeasure. At that time, we saw each other often, and she should have said to me: \"Tonight, I'm going out with Pinochia, Pasquale, Enzo, and Pinochia again. Do you want to come along?\"\n[1960-08-10T10:23:00] Lina's house | I thought about her, but she never said anything to me. She organized those gatherings all by herself, secretly, as if all those friends we'd had all along were really only hers.\n[1960-08-10T10:24:00] Lina's house | I saw her tell me in great detail about their conversation: Pinocchio was very worried, Melina wasn't able to eat anything now, and even a little food would make her vomit. I thought she was now completely satisfied.\n[1960-08-10T10:25:00] Lina's House | I heard her say that Pasquale was also very worried about his mother Giuseppina, because she could no longer sleep, her legs felt heavy, and when she visited her husband in prison, she would have palpitations and come back completely broken down, crying so hard that no one could comfort her.\n[1960-08-10T10:26:00] Lina's house | I saw her speaking. I thought about how I noticed her being even more absorbed than usual. She chose words full of emotion to describe Melina and Giuseppina's experiences, as if they were intimately connected to her body, as if she could completely feel their pain.\n[1960-08-10T10:27:00] Lina's house | When she spoke, she would touch her cheek, chest, stomach, and waist. I thought that those parts of her no longer belonged to her, but to the two women, as if she knew everything about them, including every detail.\n[1960-08-10T10:28:00] Lina's house | I realized she wanted me to understand that no one confided in me, but she could say anything to her. Worse still, she wanted me to feel lost and completely cut off from the world, unable to sense the suffering of those around me.\n[1960-08-10T10:29:00] Lina's house | I saw her talking about Giuseppina. I thought as if I had always been watching her, even though Lina was engaged and then married.\n[1960-08-10T10:30:00] Lina's house | I saw her talking about Melina. I thought that just like Pinocchio and Antonio's mother were deeply engraved in her mind, she knew Melina's madness inside out.\n[1960-08-10T10:31:00] Lina's house | I saw her start to list many people from Mergellina, people I wasn't very familiar with. I thought she had been watching them from afar all along, knowing them very well.",

    "text": "[1960-08-10T10:32:00] Lina's House | I heard her say at last, \"I had an ice cream with Antonio.\"\n[1960-08-10T10:33:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"How is he?\"  \n\"Fine.\"  \n\"Did he mention me to you at all?\"  \n\"No, not in the least.\"  \n\"When is he leaving?\"  \n\"In September.\"  \n\"Marcello didn't help him at all.\"  \n\"That's certain.\" I felt a sharp pain in my stomach when I heard that name.\n[1960-08-10T10:34:00] Lina's house | What if it's certain? If it's really certain, if the Solara brothers wouldn't have helped him at all, then why did you take me to them? You're already married, so why are you still meeting alone with those friends? Why did you eat ice cream with Antonio and not tell me?\n[1960-08-10T10:35:00] Lina's house | I was thinking, even though you know he's my ex-husband and he doesn't want to see me anymore, I still want to see him. Are you trying to take revenge on me? Just because I went out in a car with your husband, and I didn't say a word about our conversation?\n[1960-08-10T10:36:00] Lina's house | I saw myself uneasily getting dressed. I heard myself whispering that I had something to do and that I was leaving.\n[1960-08-10T10:37:00] Lina's house | I heard her say, \"There's something else I have to tell you.\" She told me very seriously that Rino, Marcello, and Michele had sent Stefano to Piazza Martiri to check out the shop's display. The three of them were in the middle of sacks of cement, paint cans, and brushes, and they showed Stefano a wall facing the entrance. They told Stefano they wanted to put up a large photo of her in her wedding dress on that wall.\n[1960-08-10T10:38:00] Lina's House | I heard Stefano listening to them, then he replied that it was certainly a good publicity stunt, but he felt it wasn't appropriate. The three of them still insisted on using the photo, and Stefano refused Marcello, saying \"no\" to Michele and Rino as well.\n[1960-08-10T10:39:00] Lina's house | I thought, in the end, I had won our bet: she hadn't yielded to the Solara brothers.\n[1960-08-10T10:40:00] Lina's house | I saw myself forcing an excited expression. I heard, \"You saw, didn't you? You always talk badly about Stefano, he's really pitiable! Actually, I was right, now you have to start learning.\"\n[1960-08-10T10:41:00] Lina's house | I heard \"We'll wait and see.\"  \n\"What are we waiting for? We made it clear when we bet, and now you've lost.\"  \n\"We'll wait a bit longer,\" Lina repeated.\n[1960-08-10T10:42:00] Lina's house | I felt even worse, and I thought she didn't know what she really wanted.\n[1960-08-10T10:43:00] Lina's house | I thought she was very upset because she had misjudged her husband. Or maybe I was exaggerating; perhaps Stefano's refusal was something she actually appreciated. But regarding the photo, she wanted the conflict between the men to be more intense. Now she's a bit disappointed because the Solara brothers didn't push further.\n[1960-08-10T10:44:00] Lina's house | I saw one of her hands nervously brush across her waist, sliding down along a leg, as if lingering in parting. I saw a look of very complex emotion flash in her eyes—pain, worry, and irritation all mixed together, just like the night Melina disappeared, when I saw the same expression in her eyes.\n[1960-08-10T10:45:00] Lina's house | I thought to myself: She might still secretly hope that her photo, when enlarged, would be displayed in a shop in the city center. Now that Michele hasn't been able to force Stefano into it, isn't she feeling a bit regretful?\n[1960-08-10T10:46:00] Lina's house | Why not? I thought. She always wants to be on top, I told myself. That's just who she is: the most beautiful, the most elegant, the richest, especially the smartest.\n[1960-08-10T10:47:00] Lina's House | The thought of Lina really starting to study again makes me feel a bit discouraged. Of course, she'll make up for the years she missed, and she'll sit beside me, her elbow touching mine, and we'll take the high school graduation exam together.\n[1960-08-10T10:48:00] Lina's house | I thought about how suddenly that situation was unbearable, but what hurt me even more was my own reaction inside. I felt ashamed.\n[1960-08-10T10:49:00] Lina's house | I told her right away that it would be perfect if we could study together again, and I asked her how she planned to start. She shrugged. I said, \"I really have to go now.\"\n[1960-08-10T10:50:00] Lina's house | I saw that this time she didn't try to stop me.\n[1960-08-10T11:00:00] In the hallway | I saw her as usual in the hallway, and I started analyzing why she had done it. I thought, or rather, it was my own feeling.\n[1960-08-10T11:05:00] In the hallway | I thought about her now living in the new Mergellina, locked inside her very modern house, completely isolated, and often physically abused by Stefano. She was focused on a mysterious, unknown war with her own body, keeping herself from entering a [pregnancy state]. Now she was jealous of my academic achievements, so she made that crazy bet with me, forcing herself to start studying again.\n[1960-08-10T11:06:00] In the hallway | I thought about how, when she saw me being freer than her, the difficulties I faced in my studies after breaking up with Antonio were nothing compared to the struggles she was going through.\n[1960-08-10T11:07:00] In the hallway | I kept thinking and thinking, and without realizing it, I found myself reluctantly standing in her position again. I admired her once more. Yes, if she were to start learning all over again, that would be wonderful.\n[1960-08-10T11:08:00] In the hallway | I thought back to elementary school days, when she was always first and I was always second. She would give study new meaning, because she knew what meaning to give it. Always following behind her, I felt safe and strong. Yes, yes, yes, we have to start over again.\n[1960-08-10T11:30:00] On the way home | I saw on the way home, and suddenly I remembered her expression—the one that mixed pain, fear, and annoyance. Why did I think of that?\n[1960-08-10T11:31:00] On the way home | I thought again about theprimary school female teacher who collapsed on the ground with her disheveled body, and also about Melina's uncontrollable body.\n[1960-08-10T11:32:00] On the way home | I found myself aimlessly observing the women on both sides of the road. I thought suddenly, and I realized that I had always lived in a very self-centered world, my vision was extremely limited.\n[1960-08-10T11:33:00] On the way home | I thought about how I could only focus on those girls—Pinochietta, Girola, Pinochietta, Pinochietta, Pinochietta, Lina, and myself, along with the girls at school, whom I had never paid attention to—Melina, Giuseppina, Nunzia, Lina, and Maria Carraci.\n[1960-08-10T11:34:00] On the way home | The only thing I ever worried about was my mother's limp body, the only one who could truly threaten me. I feared that suddenly I might become just like her.\n[1960-08-10T11:35:00] On the way home | At that moment, what came into my view was the image of these mother figures.\n[1960-08-10T11:36:00] On the way home | I saw that they were all restless yet resigned. Their thin lips were tightly closed, their backs bent, or they cursed the children who troubled them with harsh words.\n[1960-08-10T11:37:00] On the way home | I saw their bodies were all very thin, with sunken eyes and prominent cheekbones, or their hips were very large, their ankles swollen, their chests sagging, carrying heavy shopping bags, while the youngest child tugged at their skirts, wanting them to pick her up.\n[1960-08-10T11:38:00] On the way home | I just thought of something! Oh my God! They're only ten years older than me, maybe twenty at most, but they've lost all their feminine features, which is the thing we girls care about the most. We highlight our femininity through clothing and makeup.\n[1960-08-10T11:39:00] On the way home | I thought about how, because of the hardships of life, because of old age, or because of illness, their bodies were worn down, and their bodies became more and more like those of their husbands, fathers, or brothers.\n[1960-08-10T11:40:00] On the way home | I wonder when this transformation began? Was it because of housework? Did it start with [pregnancy status]? Or was it when I started getting beaten?\n[1960-08-10T11:41:00] On the way home | Would Lina also end up like Nunzia? Would her delicate face take on Fernando's features, and would her graceful walk turn into Rino's, waddling with his arms flung wide?\n[1960-08-10T11:42:00] On the way home | I thought about my own body too, that one day it would be destroyed as well, not only showing my mother's face but also my father's?\n[1960-08-10T11:43:00] On the way home | I thought about how everything I had learned at school would gradually disappear, and Mergellina would take over. All those thoughts, ways of behaving, everything would blend together into a dark, muddy pit. Anaximander, the ancient Greek philosopher, would mix with my father; the poet Fulgine from San Gimignano would merge with Don Achille. The atomic valence from chemistry would mix with the pond. The Greek imperfect tense and Hesiod's \"Theogony\" would blend with the arrogance and rudeness of the Solara brothers. Just like everything that had happened in the city for thousands of years, getting more and more chaotic, more and more corrupt?\n[1960-08-10T11:44:00] On the way home | I thought, all of a sudden, I couldn't help but convince myself that I had mixed Lina's feelings with my own.\n[1960-08-10T11:45:00] On the way home | I wondered if that was why she had those expressions, that sense of discomfort? She touched her legs, her waist, as if saying a farewell? When talking about those topics, she touched herself, as if already feeling her body surrounded by Melina's and Giuseppina's bodies, maybe feeling afraid and disgusted? She went to see our mutual friend because she wanted to take action?\n[1960-08-10T11:46:00] On the way home | I remember her gaze, when I was a child, and she saw Oliviero teacher fall from the podium, collapsing to the ground like a broken puppet.\n[1960-08-10T11:47:00] On the way home | I thought about the way I remembered her looking at Melina, when Melina was on the other side of the street, eating the soap she had just bought.\n[1960-08-10T11:48:00] On the way home | I remember how Lina told us girls about the murder, about the blood flowing down the copper pot, and she believed that it was not a man who killed Don Achille, but a woman.\n[1960-08-10T11:49:00] On the way home | I thought of it as if she had seen and heard it, as that woman's body was dissolved by hatred when she told us the story, losing its feminine qualities because of revenge, or perhaps because of justice.\n[1960-08-15T09:00:00] Beach Garden | Starting with the last week of July, I went every day—every day, including Sundays—to take the shopkeeper's daughters to the seaside garden. I knew that besides all the various little things that the girls would need, I also put the book that Teacher Galiani had lent me into my canvas bag.\n[1960-08-15T09:10:00] Beach Garden | I thought about how all those books discussed things of the past, present, and future of this world. The words in the books were especially like the textbooks from school, but much more difficult and interesting. I wasn't used to this kind of reading, and I soon got bored.\n[1960-08-15T09:20:00] Seaside Garden | I saw that the sea felt murky, the sun was scorching, and the heat enveloped the bay and the city. I thought of several young girls who all needed special attention, and it was very exhausting. The chaotic images, thoughts, and desires always disturbed the lines of text, and it took a lot of willpower to get back into the words.\n[1960-08-15T09:25:00] Seaside Garden | I thought about how I was hoping something would happen that would completely absorb me, freeing me from this vulgar life above, below, and all around me.\n[1960-08-15T09:30:00] Seaside Garden | I had one eye on the shopkeeper's daughter and the other on The Origins of Inequality Among Mankind. I know I'm about to turn seventeen.\n[1960-08-20T14:00:00] Seaside Garden | I remember one Sunday, I felt a pair of hands covering my eyes. I heard a woman's voice asking me, \"Guess who I am?\"\n[1960-08-20T14:01:00] Seaside Garden | I realized I had recognized the voice of Pinocchia, and I wished that Nino was with her. I truly wished he could see how beautiful I looked after sunbathing and taking a seawater bath, hoped he would see me reading a difficult book.\n[1960-08-20T14:02:00] Beach Garden | I saw myself suddenly turn around. I heard myself shouting happily: \"Pinocchio!\" I saw Nino, but he wasn't there; instead, I saw Alfonso Carracci.\n[1960-08-20T14:03:00] Beach Garden | I saw him: a light blue towel draped over his shoulders, a cigarette, lighter, and wallet in his hands, wearing black swim trunks with white stripes. His whole body was very pale, as if he had never seen the sun in his life.\n[1960-08-20T14:04:00] Seaside Garden | I thought about seeing them together, and I was very surprised. Alfonso Carracci had two failing grades and had to take make-up exams in October. He'd been helping out at Capodimonte all along, and I thought he should be studying on Sunday, not coming to the seashore.\n[1960-08-20T14:05:00] Seaside Garden | I heard her tell me that her parents had quarreled with the landlord Nella a year ago, and they had rented a small villa in Casetta together with a few friends from Il Messaggero. I thought about Pinocchio, and I felt sure she was with her family in Barano.\n[1960-08-20T14:06:00] Beach Garden | I saw her smiling very seductively at Alfonso Carracci, the man it was. I heard her say she was going back to San Gregorio Armeno for a few days, that she needed to take her schoolbooks with her to study—she had three subjects to retake, and also she wanted to meet someone.\n[1960-08-20T14:07:00] Beach Garden | I saw that I couldn't help myself. I heard and immediately asked her how Nino had done on his high school graduation exam.",

    "text": "[1960-08-20T14:08:00] Seaside Garden | I saw her make a very scornful expression. \"I heard that he got nine points for two subjects and eight for the rest. After knowing his results, he went to England alone, with no money in his pocket. He said he would find a job there, and come back after he had learned English well.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:09:00] Beach Garden | I heard \"Then what?\"  \n\"Then I don't know, maybe he'll go to college and major in business.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:10:00] Seaside Garden | I thought of the countless questions I had to ask. I wanted to find out who the girl was who was waiting for him outside school, and I wanted to ask him whether he really left alone or if he left with that girl.\n[1960-08-20T14:11:00] Beach Garden | I saw that, and Alfonso Carracci said somewhat awkwardly. I heard, \"Lina will come later too.\" Then he added, \"Antonio drove us here just now.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:12:00] Seaside Garden | I heard \"Antonio?\" I thought Alfonso Carracci must have noticed the change in my tone, the flush on my face, and the jealousy in my eyes.\n[1960-08-20T14:13:00] Beach Garden | I saw him smile briefly and say. I heard that \"Stefano is busy with his new Capodimonte project; he has to make a counter, so he can't come. But Lina really wants to see you; she has something to tell you, so she sent Antonio to bring us here.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:14:00] Seaside Garden | I saw Pinochia emphasizing. She clapped her hands happily, wanting me to understand that she already knew what it was. I heard, \"Yes, she wants to tell you something very important.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:15:00] Seaside Garden | What was I thinking? Watching Pinocchio's behavior, it seemed like a good thing. Maybe Lina had already talked to Antonio, and now he was going to make up with me; maybe the Solara brothers had finally taken action and contacted someone in the district, so Antonio wouldn't have to go to war. I immediately thought of these possibilities.\n[1960-08-20T14:20:00] Seaside Garden | I saw it when Antonio and Lina appeared. I thought to myself that I would immediately rule out these possibilities.\n[1960-08-20T14:21:00] Seaside Garden | I thought of Antonio being there, clearly sent by Lina, just to fill her empty weekend, just because he felt it was a fortunate and necessary thing to be her friend.\n[1960-08-20T14:22:00] Seaside Garden | I saw him and asked about his mother. I heard his answer was perfunctory. I saw that he still wore sorrow all over his face, his eyes alert and cold as he greeted me.\n[1960-08-20T14:23:00] Beach Garden | I saw him looking around nervously, then quickly jumping into the water with a few girls, who were all happy about Antonio's arrival.\n[1960-08-20T14:24:00] Seaside Garden | I saw that as for Lina, she looked pale, her lips untinted, and her eyes full of hostility. I thought I didn't feel like she had anything to tell me.\n[1960-08-20T14:25:00] Seaside Garden | I saw her sitting on the concrete platform, flipping through a book I was reading, saying not a word.\n[1960-08-20T14:26:00] Beach Garden | I saw Pinocchia feeling embarrassed by the silence, wanting to express her enthusiasm for everything in the world, but her words came out jumbled, and in the end, she went swimming too.\n[1960-08-20T14:27:00] Beach Garden | I saw Alfonso Carracci choose a spot as far away from us as possible, and he stayed under the sun, watching the swimmers with intense focus, as if finding it extremely interesting to watch those naked people go in and out of the water.\n[1960-08-20T14:30:00] Beach Garden | \"I heard, 'Who gave you this book?' Lina asked me.\"  \n\"My Latin and Greek teacher.\"  \n\"Why didn't you tell me?\"  \n\"I thought you wouldn't be interested.\"  \n\"Do you know what interests you, and what doesn't?\"\n[1960-08-20T14:31:00] Beach Garden | I thought about changing my tone, making it softer, and I wanted to show off a bit.\n[1960-08-20T14:32:00] Seaside Garden | I heard myself say, \"I'll lend them to you after I finish reading them. These books are the ones the teacher assigned to the students who study well, and Nino reads these too.\"  \n\"Who's Nino?\"\n[1960-08-20T14:33:00] Beach Garden | I wondered if she had said that on purpose? Was she pretending not to remember his name in order to belittle him?\n[1960-08-20T14:34:00] Seaside Garden | \"I heard that he's the one from the wedding video, the brother of Pinocchia, the son of Nino.\"  \n\"The ugly guy you liked?\"  \n\"I already told you, I don't like him anymore, but he's doing something really impressive.\"  \n\"What is it?\"\n[1960-08-20T14:35:00] Seaside Garden | I saw myself repeating Pinocchio's words with great excitement. I heard, \"For example, he's in England now: working, traveling, learning English.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:36:00] Beach Garden | I heard myself say to Lina: \"Just think, if we could do things like that too—traveling, working as waiters in restaurants to support ourselves, learning English, speaking it better than a native speaker. How great that would be. Why can he do it, but we can't?\"\n[1960-08-20T14:37:00] Beach Garden | I heard, \"He's finished school?\"  \n\"Yes, he has his high school diploma, and then he's going to college to study some very advanced things.\"  \n\"Is he a good student?\"  \n\"He's just as good as you.\"  \n\"I'm not studying anymore now.\"  \n\"Yes, but you lost the bet with me, so now you have to start studying again.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:38:00] Seaside Garden | \"I heard 'Come on, Elena.'\"\n\"Stefano doesn't want to?\"\n\"There's a new Capodimonte now, and I have to help manage it.\"\n\"You can study at Capodimonte.\"\n\"It's not possible.\"\n[1960-08-20T14:39:00] Beach Garden | I heard, \"You already promised me, you said we'd graduate together.\"  \n\"No.\"  \n\"Why?\"\n[1960-08-20T14:40:00] Seaside Garden | I saw Lina run her fingers back and forth over the book's cover, trying to smooth it out.\n[1960-08-20T14:41:00] Seaside Garden | I heard her mutter, \"It's so hot.\" \"I've given birth,\" she said, not waiting for my reaction.\n[1960-08-20T14:42:00] Seaside Garden | I saw her put down the book and go to the edge of the concrete platform, then jump into the water without hesitation. She suddenly shouted Antonio's name.\n[1960-08-20T14:43:00] Seaside Garden | I saw that at this moment, Antonio was spraying water at Pinochia and several other girls.\n[1960-08-20T14:44:00] Beach Garden | I saw her throw her arms open and clumsily splash the water, then she started struggling—she couldn't swim. I heard, \"Save me! Anton...\"\n[1960-08-25T07:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw that in the days to come, Lina was extremely active and energetic, almost fanatical. She started working busily at the newly opened Capodimonte, as if it were the most important thing in the world.\n[1960-08-25T07:30:00] Lina's house | I saw her getting up very early in the morning, earlier than Stefano. She was vomiting while making coffee, and after finishing, she immediately started vomiting again.\n[1960-08-25T08:00:00] Elena's front door | I saw him become very considerate, wanting to drive her to the store. I heard, but Lina would refuse, saying she wanted to walk, while the weather was still cool, to breathe in the morning fresh air.\n[1960-08-25T08:30:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her walking down the empty street, between the newly built houses, all the way to the shop that was still under renovation. She opened the metal shutter, wiped the paint off the floor, and waited for the workers and suppliers to arrive, bringing scales, a slicing machine, and other equipment.\n[1960-08-25T09:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her have someone place those things where they belonged, and she even moved the equipment herself to make the layout more reasonable. I saw those tough-looking men and the difficult-to-control boys, all of whom acted obediently in front of her.\n[1960-08-25T09:30:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her, already doing the hard work herself before she could finish giving the order. I heard those people would anxiously shout at her: \"Mrs. Carraci! I'm coming!\" They would all rush over in a panic to help her.\n[1960-08-25T14:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I noticed that despite the heat, Lina wasn't very energetic, but she was not only busy managing the new Capodimonte, but sometimes she would also accompany her sister-in-law to the city center, checking out the stores under renovation on Piazza Martiri.\n[1960-08-25T14:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I knew that everything there was always managed by Michele, and Rino often went to check on it. He felt justified because, on one hand, he was the producer of \"Lina\" shoes, and on the other, he was Stefano's brother-in-law, and Stefano was a shareholder in the Solara company.\n[1960-08-25T14:30:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that Lina was never idle in the shoe store. She inspected the progress, climbed the mason's ladder, looked down from above at the layout of the entire shop, then came down and rearranged the displays.\n[1960-08-25T14:40:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I know at first everyone found it unbelievable, but they soon let her do as she pleased. I thought Michele was the most hostile and sarcastic, and he soon realized that Lina's advice was right.\n[1960-08-25T14:41:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I heard \"Madam.\" He spoke again, his words laced with their usual sharpness, \"Come help me clean the bar too, I'll pay you for it.\"",

    "text": "[1960-08-25T16:00:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw that when she had finished causing trouble in her shop on Martiri Square, she started venturing into the old territory of the Carracci family, the original Capodimonte, and she began going there often. I thought about getting involved in the Capodimonte affair, something she had never even considered.\n[1960-08-25T16:10:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw her insisting that Stefano keep Alfonso Carracci at home because he needed to study for a make-up exam at the start of the term.\n[1960-08-25T16:20:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw her getting Pinocchia and her mother to go often to the shop on Martirini Square, meddling in its affairs. She did a little today and a little tomorrow, completely renovating the old shop inside and out, making it lively and making full use of the space.\n[1960-08-25T16:30:00] Old Capodimonte | I knew that soon Maria and Pinocchia's positions in the store were undermined. Pinocchia became very important, and she had Stefano give her a raise.\n[1960-08-30T18:00:00] Capodimonte | I returned from the seaside garden as dusk approached, leaving a few girls with the stationery shop owner. Every time I passed by Lina's Capodimonte, I would check on her, see how she was doing, and check if her belly had grown bigger.\n[1960-08-30T18:05:00] Capodimonte | I found myself asking about [fertility status]. I heard her either not answer at all or pull me outside the shop, saying some incomprehensible things. I saw her very anxious, and her face didn't look good.\n[1960-08-30T18:06:00] Capodimonte | I heard something like, \"I don't want to talk about this. It's a sickness. My body feels empty and heavy.\"\n[1960-08-30T18:07:00] Capodimonte | I see, and then she would start talking about the new Capodimonte and the old Capodimonte, as well as the shops in Piazza Martiri, always in that very seductive way. I thought she wanted me to believe these places were magical, that something extraordinary happened there. I was so pitiful, not as good as her.\n[1960-08-30T18:08:00] Capodimonte | I thought about it, but I already knew her tricks. I listened to what she said, but I didn't believe a word she said.\n[1960-08-30T18:09:00] Capodimonte | I thought that even so, in the end I was still confused by her way of acting both as a servant and a mistress.\n[1960-08-30T18:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw Lina talking to me while also speaking to the customers and Pinocchia. Her hands never stopped—opening bags, cutting, weighing, then taking money and giving change.\n[1960-08-30T18:11:00] Capodimonte | I saw her fully immersed in the conversation and the actions, exhausting herself completely. I thought I was really engaged in a fierce, boundless struggle, just to forget that burden, that burden she called so discordantly \"the inner void.\"\n[1960-08-30T18:12:00] Capodimonte | I saw her go to the checkout counter, taking as much as she wanted. The thing that impressed me the most was her carefree attitude toward money.\n[1960-08-30T18:13:00] Capodimonte | I thought of money as that drawer for her, the safe she had imagined in her childhood, which she could open and generously give away to others.\n[1960-08-30T18:14:00] Capodimonte | I saw that if there wasn't enough money in the cash register (which rarely happened), she just had to look at Stefano once, and he would instantly become generous again, like in the days of their romance. He would lift up his white coat and pull out a thick wallet from his pants pocket. I heard him ask, \"How much?\" Lina showed him with her fingers. Her husband would extend his right arm and hand her the money, which she would take with her long, slender hand.\n[1960-08-30T18:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw Pinocchio looking at Lina behind the counter, as if she were a movie star in a magazine. I thought, during that time, Antonio's sister must have felt as if she were in a fairy tale, her eyes sparkling every time Lina opened the drawer to give her money.\n[1960-08-30T18:16:00] Capodimonte | I saw her husband turn around, and then she easily handed the money to someone else. I know she gave Pinochcia money because Antonio was going to join the army. She gave Pasquale money because he had to pull out three teeth and it was very urgent.\n[1960-09-01T08:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that later a midwife came and shaved the child. I knew Lina's baby had been in her womb for more than ten weeks.\n[1960-09-01T10:00:00] Capodimonte | At the beginning of September, she still pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to buy books. I heard, \"What book?\"  \n\"The textbooks from school, of course, and also the extra ones.\"\n[1960-09-01T10:05:00] Capodimonte | After hearing that, she put money into my pocket. I heard myself telling her that Professor Oliviero hadn't come back from the hospital yet, and I didn't know if she would be able to get me the school textbooks as usual.\n[1960-09-01T10:06:00] Capodimonte | I saw myself breaking free, refusing her money. I thought I didn't want to act like a poor relative and ask her for money.\n[1960-09-01T10:07:00] Capodimonte | I told her I had to wait until school started. Also, the owner of the stationery shop extended my employment until mid-September, so I could take a few girls to the seaside garden, which would let me earn a little more than expected, and then I could buy books myself. She seemed sorry and insisted that if the teacher couldn't get textbooks, I could come to her.\n[1960-09-01T10:10:00] Capodimonte | I thought not only me, but all of our friends found it hard to get used to her generosity.\n[1960-09-01T10:15:00] Capodimonte | I know, for example, Pasquale, who didn't want to accept the money for a dentist, feeling humiliated, but in the end he took the money because his face had already distorted, one eye was already red, and ice packs did nothing.\n[1960-09-01T10:20:00] Capodimonte | I knew that Antonio was going to accept extra money for Pinochietta, and it made me uncomfortable. He had to convince himself that it was a compensation for Pinochietta, since Stefano had paid her so little before.\n[1960-09-01T10:30:00] Capodimonte | I thought about how we had never really seen money, and how we valued even ten lire very much. Even if we found a coin on the road, we would be overjoyed. So Lina's extravagant way of spending money, as if it weren't money at all but just some worthless scraps of copper or paper, was an unforgivable crime.\n[1960-09-01T10:35:00] Capodimonte | I watched her do it in silence, not allowing any room for refusal, just like when she was a child and organized games for everyone, assigning roles to each of us. I thought that after she gave me the money, she would quickly change the subject, as if nothing had happened.\n[1960-09-02T08:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her the next day, already busy in the new Capodimonte with Pinocchia Peluso. I saw her immersed in the scent of these foods, surrounded by cheese, sausages, bread, salted fish, fresh buffalo milk cheese, ham, and lard, as well as bags full of beans.\n[1960-09-05T20:00:00] Capodimonte | I remember one night, Pasquale spoke to me again in that vague way, saying: \"Sausages can be sold, shoes can be sold. Lina is still our friend, still on our side, our ally, our companion. She's very rich now, but that's what she deserves.\"\n[1960-09-05T20:05:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"Yes, that's what she deserved. The money wasn't given to her because she was Mrs. Carraci, the future mother of a butcher's son, but because she designed the 'Lina' shoes. Although now everyone seems to have forgotten, we, as her friends, will always remember that.\"\n[1960-09-05T20:10:00] Capodimonte | I thought what he said was all true. In just a few years, so much had happened around Lina. Even though we were only seventeen then, time around us had become like the yellow cream in the pastry machine—thick and sticky.\n[1960-09-10 16:00:00] Small Park | I saw the summer end, and as the exams approached, she watched me looking up unfamiliar words in the dictionary. I thought of her face full of confusion.\n[1960-09-10 16:05:00] Small Park | I saw myself looking up the unfamiliar words in the order they appeared in the sentence. After checking the vocabulary, I could barely understand the meaning of the sentence.\n[1960-09-10 16:06:00] Small Park | I saw her carefully asking me. \"I heard, 'Did the Latin teacher make you do this?'\"\n[1960-09-10 16:07:00] Small Park | I knew the teacher never said anything, she just assigned us homework and didn't tell us how to do it. That was my own way of figuring it out.\n[1960-09-10 16:08:00] Small Park | I saw her hesitate for a moment, and she suggested that I say it. I heard, \"First, read the entire sentence and find the verb. Once you know the verb's person, you'll understand who the subject is.\"\n[1960-09-10 16:09:00] Small Park | I heard, \"After finding the subject, you start looking for the object—if it's a transitive verb, you find the object; if it's not a transitive verb, you look for other complements. Try it...\"\n[1960-09-10 16:15:00] Small Park | I saw I tried it. I thought that suddenly, translation had become very easy.\n[1960-09-10T15:00:00] Beach Garden | I thought about how Lina always carried resentment in her heart, and she had confirmed this herself.\n[1960-09-10T15:01:00] Beach Garden | I was surprised to see her appear in the seaside garden. I saw on a Sunday, around three o'clock in the afternoon, the weather was very clear and the sea was calm.\n[1960-09-10T15:02:00] Beach Garden | I saw her taking the subway alone, changing buses several times before she got there. She appeared in front of me wearing a swimsuit. I saw that her face was slightly blueish, and there were many pimples on her forehead.\n[1960-09-10T15:03:00] Seaside Garden | I heard her say, \"Seventeen years of crap!\" in her dialect. I saw her, but she looked happy, her eyes filled with self-mockery.\n[1960-09-10T15:04:00] Seaside Garden | I knew she had fought with Stefano. Among the daily exchanges with the Solara brothers, issues inevitably arose regarding the shop in Piazza Martiri.\n[1960-09-10T15:05:00] Seaside Garden | I knew Michele definitely wanted Giggia to manage the shop. He threatened Rino fiercely because Rino wanted Pinocchia to take over. In the end, Michele and Stefano had a negotiation, and Michele was very stubborn; they almost came to blows.\n[1960-09-10T15:06:00] Beach Garden | I know what happened in the end? On the surface, no one came out on top; Giullia and Pina would take over the shop together. But the condition was that Stefano had to change his previous decision.\n[1960-09-10T15:07:00] Beach Garden | I couldn't figure it out. \"I heard 'What decides?' \" I asked.  \n\"See if you can guess.\"\n[1960-09-10T15:08:00] Beach Garden | I heard Lina say that Michele, still using that joking and disrespectful tone, asked Stefano for a photo of Lina in her wedding dress. This time, her husband gave in.\n[1960-09-10T15:09:00] Seaside Garden | \"I heard 'Is that true?'  \n'Yes, I told you. Just wait. They'll display my photo in the shop. The bet we made—I won, you lost. Now you have to study hard. This year, your grades in every subject must be above eight.' \"\n[1960-09-10T15:10:00] Beach Garden | I saw that, and her tone changed, becoming very serious. I heard her say that she hadn't come here because of the photo, she had already known that for her husband's bastard of a man, she was just a commodity to be traded. She had come here because of the [pregnancy] situation.\n[1960-09-10T15:11:00] Beach Garden | I saw her and we talked for a long time. I saw her very anxious, as if she urgently wanted to crush something with a mortar, and she was very calm.",

    "text": "[1960-09-10T15:12:00] Seaside Garden | \"I don't see any sense in it,\" she said, not hiding her anxiety. \"Men put their things inside your body, and you become a meat box with a little person inside. There's already a little person inside me, and that makes me feel sick. I keep throwing up, I can't stand my stomach. I know I should think positively, I know I should be rational, but I can't. I can't find a reason to submit, and I don't feel beautiful at all.\"\n[1960-09-10T15:13:00] Seaside Garden | I heard her add, \"I just don't think I can get along with kids. You can, as shown by how you took care of the shopkeeper's daughter. I can't. I was never cut out for this.\"\n[1960-09-10T15:14:00] Beach Garden | I thought about the words she said, and they made me very sad. What could I possibly say to her?\n[1960-09-10T15:15:00] Seaside Garden | I saw myself trying to ease her mind, pointing to the daughter of the stationery shop owner who was playing not far away. I heard her say, \"You don't know yet if you're up to it, if you have what it takes. You have to try.\" I said to her, \"Stay with them for a while, talk to them.\"\n[1960-09-10T15:16:00] Beach Garden | I saw her smile. Later, she spoke a few words to several girls in an extremely unnatural way, then stepped back and started talking to me. I heard some cruel people say that I've now learned the excessively sweet tone our mother often used.\n[1960-09-10T15:17:00] Seaside Garden | I saw him loosen his grip, encourage her, and ask her to try taking care of Linda—the youngest daughter of the stationery store owner.\n[1960-09-10T15:18:00] Beach Garden | I heard myself say to her: \"Go ahead, play her favorite game with her, drink from the fountain, put your mouth over the spout, or block the opening with your thumb so the water sprays around.\"\n[1960-09-10T15:19:00] Seaside Garden | I saw her reluctantly taking Linda away, holding Linda's hand. I told the two girls who were with me to go see what was happening. I thought that they would be back soon, but they hadn't returned yet. I was a little worried.\n[1960-09-10T15:20:00] Seaside Garden | I saw Lina happily wrapped up in Linda's arms, who lifted her and placed her in front of the spout, letting her drink while the water sprayed around her. I saw them all laughing heartily, as if celebrating. I thought, thank goodness, everything was normal.\n[1960-09-10T15:21:00] Beach Garden | I saw that the other two girls were also playing with Lina. I sat down at the bar and chose a spot where I could see the four of them, so I could also read for a while. I thought to myself that I felt relieved.\n[1960-09-10T15:22:00] Seaside Garden | I saw myself looking at her. I thought about what she would become if she were with her child. Things that she once couldn't stand now might make her happy. Maybe I should tell her that some meaningless things can also be beautiful.\n[1960-09-10T15:23:00] Seaside Garden | I thought that was a great-sounding line, and I was sure she would love it. She really was lucky—she already had everything important.\n[1960-09-10T15:24:00] Seaside Garden | I tried reading a few lines from Rousseau's book. When I looked up, I saw the problem had occurred—maybe Linda was too close, or maybe a girl pushed Lina, and as a result, Linda slipped from Lina's arms and her chin hit the edge of the washbasin.\n[1960-09-10T15:25:00] Beach Garden | I saw myself running out in a panic. I heard Lina, as soon as she saw me, shouting at me in a very childish tone—something I had never heard from her even when she was a child—\"It was her sister who made her fall, not me.\"\n[1960-09-10T15:26:00] Seaside Garden | I saw Lina holding Linda in her arms; she was bleeding and crying and shouting. I saw her two older sisters looking elsewhere, their faces not only tense but also strangely smiling, as if the whole thing had nothing to do with them, as if they couldn't hear or see anything.\n[1960-09-10T15:27:00] Beach Garden | I saw myself taking Linda from her arms, carrying her with resentment, and washing Linda's face with the showerhead. I saw a scar on her chin, it was horizontal.\n[1960-09-10T15:28:00] Beach Garden | I thought I'd never get the money from the stationery shop owner, and my mother would be very angry.\n[1960-09-10T15:30:00] Seaside Garden | I ran to the lifeguard at that moment. He first calmed Linda down, and when he used alcohol to disinfect her, she started screaming again. After they put several layers of gauze on her chin, she finally calmed down.\n[1960-09-10T15:35:00] Seaside Garden | I saw that I had returned to the cement platform. I thought, after all, there's nothing serious, I'll buy ice cream for the three girls.\n[1960-09-10T15:36:00] Seaside Garden | I saw that I had found Lina, who had already left.\n[1960-09-11T09:00:00] Stationery Store | I saw the shop owner woman look at Linda's wound, and she didn't seem especially surprised. But when I asked her if she would still be there the next day to pick up a few kids at the usual time, she fired me. I heard her say that her daughters had swum too much already and no longer needed me.\n[1960-09-15T10:00:00] New Capodimonte | I thought about the fact that I hadn't told Lina about losing my job. Of course, she'd never asked me what happened afterward, not even once inquired about Linda and her wounds.\n[1960-09-15T10:05:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her again, and she was very busy because the new Capodimonte was about to open. I thought of the feeling she gave me as like an athlete doing rope jumping, getting more and more wild as he jumped.\n[1960-09-15T11:00:00] Print Shop | I saw her pull me into the print shop, where she had ordered a large number of flyers to promote the opening of the new store.\n[1960-09-15T12:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw that she wanted me to go to the priest to confirm the time he would come to bless the shop and the business. I heard her say that she would hire Pinocchia Peluso, paying her a bit more than the salary she earned as a sales clerk in the fabric store.\n[1960-09-15T12:10:00] New Capodimonte | I heard her say that she was in control, managing the shop's operations, and engaged in a long-standing struggle with her husband, Pinocchia, mother-in-law, and brother Rino. I saw her, but she didn't seem aggressive.\n[1960-09-15T12:15:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her speaking in a low voice, constantly talking in the local dialect, while also busy with other things on hand. I thought these things were more important than what she had said.\n[1960-09-15T12:20:00] New Capodimonte | I heard her list the injustices her husband's and her own family had done to her: \"They calmed Michele down, just like they did with Marcello when he was angry. They used me, sacrificed me. To them, I wasn't a person, but an object. We gave Lina to him, we hung her on the wall, we didn't care what she thought—she was nothing...\"\n[1960-09-15T12:21:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her eyes, which turned around in their purple-tinged sockets when she spoke these words, and the skin on her cheekbones was taut. Sometimes she laughed, nervously, revealing her bright, dazzling teeth. I thought about it, but I didn't really believe what she said. I felt that behind her busy, energetic exterior was a person who was exhausted and searching for an escape.\n[1960-09-15T12:22:00] New Capodimonte | I asked her, \"What are you going to do?\"  \n\"Nothing in particular. I just know that if they want to do whatever they like with my photo, they'll have to kill me first.\"\n[1960-09-15T12:23:00] New Capodimonte | \"I heard, 'Don't act like this, Lina. In the end, it's a good thing. Think about it: only actors can be in ads.'\"\n\"Am I an actress?\"\n\"No.\"\n[1960-09-15T12:24:00] New Capodimonte | I heard, \"If my husband decided to sell himself out, to curry favor with the Sorellas, do you think I'd sell myself too?\"\n[1960-09-15T12:25:00] New Capodimonte | I heard myself telling her about my worries, and she laughed, saying that after she had [childbearing status], her husband had never touched a single hair on her again. I thought about how I wanted her to calm down. I was scared that Stefano would lose patience and hit her again.\n[1960-09-15T12:26:00] New Capodimonte | I thought, but just as she said those words, I was very doubtful that the photo thing was anything more than an excuse. In reality, she just wanted to provoke everyone, to have Stefano, the Solara brothers, and even Rino kill her, forcing them to act on her, so they could eliminate the living thing inside her, relieving her of the pain and torment.",

I heard, \"A college student, maybe?\"\n[1960-09-20 12:00:00] Outside the school | I saw that I had finished my exam and Lina was waiting for me under the tree outside.\n[1960-09-20 12:01:00] Outside the school | I saw myself hugging her when I left. I heard myself say to her that I had done very well on the exam, and I asked her if she still wanted to continue studying with me.\n[1960-09-20 12:02:00] Outside the school | I thought about how we studied together, and it was she who first suggested it. I felt that inviting her to continue studying with me was a great way to express my happiness and gratitude.\n[1960-09-20 12:03:00] Outside the school | I saw her reject me instantly, almost with some irritation. I heard her say that she just wanted to understand the principles of Latin, because those people who were so good all studied Latin.\n[1960-09-20 12:04:00] Outside the school | \"I heard 'Then what?' 'Now I've figured it out, enough.'\"\n[1960-09-20 12:05:00] Outside the school | I heard, \"Don't you like it?\" \"It's okay. I need to borrow some books from the library to read.\"\n[1960-09-20 12:06:00] Outside the school | I heard, \"Latin?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1960-09-20 12:07:00] Outside the school | \"I heard, 'But there's a lot to learn now.' 'You study for me. If I have difficulties, you have to help me.'\"\n[1960-09-20 12:08:00] Outside the school | \"I heard, 'I'm going to make something with my brother.' 'What thing?'\"\n[1960-09-20 12:09:00] Outside the school | I heard, \"I'll show it to you.\"\n[1960-09-20T10:00:00] New Capodimonte | I noticed that for a while, her face didn't look good. There were pimples on her forehead, deep under her eyes, her cheekbones stood out, and the skin on her cheeks looked somewhat translucent.\n[1960-09-20T18:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw that the priest I had invited hadn't yet blessed the shop, so Lina, wearing an expression of complete disdain, shoved some money into his hand and sent him away. I saw her dressed in a very messy way, treating her husband like a servant in front of everyone. I thought my speculation was confirmed on the night when the new Capodimonte opened.\n[1960-09-20T18:30:00] New Capodimonte | I watched as she cut the ham, placed the slices between the bread, and served it with wine, giving it free to everyone present.\n[1960-09-20T19:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw Capodimonte just open its door, and inside it was already packed with people. Stefano was dressed very formally, he wasn't even wearing his white coat, and his clothes were all covered in oil. I thought about how this approach ultimately proved very successful, and she and Pinocchia could hardly cope with it; even Stefano had to help her deal with it.\n[1960-09-20T22:00:00] Lina's House | I saw that when they got home, they were both exhausted. The husband flew into a rage at her, and she kept pouring oil on the fire. I heard her shouting at him, saying that if he wanted a obedient wife, he had the wrong woman, because she was neither his mother nor his sister.\n[1960-09-20T22:10:00] Lina's House | I saw that she was constantly provoking, looking for trouble. She mentioned the Solara brothers and the photo, and she cursed Stefano terribly, but Stefano didn't hit her.\n[1960-09-21T10:00:00] Lina's house | The next day, when she told me what had happened, she rubbed her thumb against her index finger, denying that Stefano loved her. I heard myself say to her that, despite Stefano's flaws, there was no doubt he loved Lina. She said, \"He only knows this.\"\n[1960-09-21T10:05:00] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'The cash register is full, all because of me. I brought him wealth and a child—what else does he want?'\"  \n\"What else do you want?\" I was surprised by the anger in my own words, so I immediately smiled at her, hoping she hadn't noticed.\n[1960-09-21T10:06:00] Lina's house | I saw that I remembered her face full of confusion, and I touched my forehead with my finger. I thought maybe she didn't even know what she wanted, she just couldn't settle down and be at peace.\n[1960-09-25T15:00:00] New Capodimonte | I sometimes see her in the new community's Capodimonte, and a few times she was free, or didn't have to talk with those suppliers. I saw her face full of confusion, her hand placed in the middle of her hair on her forehead, as if trying to plug a wound, her expression looked like she couldn't catch her breath.\n[1960-09-28T16:00:00] At the entrance of Posillipo | I heard someone calling my name on the road, it was Lina. She told me she had found a solution. I saw her eyes shining, as if she were feverish.\n[1960-09-28T16:01:00] At the entrance of Posillipo | I heard, \"What method?\"  \n\"About the photo. If they want to display it, they have to do it my way.\"  \n\"What do you mean?\"\n[1960-09-28T16:02:00] At the entrance of Posillipo | I saw that she didn't tell me what to do, and she told me to accompany her that night to Piazza Martiri, saying that there we would meet the Solara brothers, Giggia, Pinocchia, and her brother Rino. I thought maybe her thoughts weren't very clear at that time. But I knew what kind of person she was, and I could tell from the expression on her face that her mind was burning, beginning to pick up some signals rising from the depths of darkness.\n[1960-09-28T16:03:00] At the entrance of Posillipo | \"I heard 'Okay.' I said, 'But you have to promise me, don't do anything crazy.'\"  \n\"I promise you.\" I thought about how she wanted me to help and support her. I understood that she already had an idea in her mind, one that could help her break free from the oppressive situation she'd been trapped in for so long—a violent release.\n[1960-09-28T20:00:00] Convertible car | After I saw the store close, Stefano and she came to pick me up in a car. I realized from their brief exchange that her husband also didn't know what she wanted to do. My presence didn't offer Stefano any reassurance, but instead made him even more cautious.\n[1960-09-28T20:10:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina acting very at ease. She said to her husband that if the photo really had to be used, she thought she at least had the right to offer some suggestions on how to present it. \"I heard 'Is it the frame, the walls, and the lighting?'\" Stefano asked.  \n\"I need to take a look.\"  \n\"That's it, don't make a big deal out of it, Lina.\"  \n\"Okay.\"\n[1960-09-28T20:30:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Piazza Martiri | I saw that it was a very clear and comfortable night, with the store brightly lit, shining brilliantly in the square, visible from afar, where a large photo of Lina in her wedding dress was placed against the wall.\n[1960-09-28T20:35:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw the store filled with shoe boxes, paint cans, and ladders, making it hard to take a step. Marcello, Rino, Giggia, and Pinocchia clearly had long faces. I thought that for different reasons, none of them wanted to face Lina's capriciousness again.\n[1960-09-28T20:36:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | The only one who greeted us politely was Michele, still in his usual sarcastic way, smiling as he spoke to my friend. I heard, \"Pretty lady, tell us, what are you really thinking, or are you just here to ruin this beautiful evening?\"\n[1960-09-28T20:40:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that Lina had placed the photo against the wall, so I had someone move it to the floor. Marcello always showed a bit of shyness when facing Lina; he asked very carefully. I heard, \"What do you mean by putting it down?\"  \n\"I'll show you.\"\n[1960-09-28T20:41:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw the Solara brothers place the photo on the floor. Lina frowned, circling around the picture, her eyes narrowed to a slit. Rino spoke up then. \"I heard, 'Don't be foolish, Lina! You know how much this thing costs to print? If you ruin it, you'll have a lot to answer for!'\"\n[1960-09-28T20:45:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw her looking for something, and she found a black paper package in a corner. She took out a black pair of scissors from it, and also grabbed a box of drafting pushpins from the shelf.\n[1960-09-28T20:50:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw her return to the photo with an extremely focused expression, blocking out all the surrounding distractions. She cut some black paper into strips and placed them over the photo. She then gestured or looked at me to indicate that she needed my help. I saw, beneath our anxious glances—some filled with hostility.\n[1960-09-28T20:55:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I realized I had been going along with her, just like when we were children. What an exciting moment that was! How much I loved being by her side, understanding her intentions, knowing what she was going to do before she even did. I felt that she saw things others couldn't, and what she was doing was trying to make us see too.\n[1960-09-28T21:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw her try to lift the easel by herself in the end, but she couldn't. At that moment, Marcello came to help, and I gave a hand too, propping the easel against the wall. I thought about how I had become happy, and I felt her fingers grip the scissors tightly, moving with determination and ease as she pinned the black strip of paper into place.\n[1960-09-28T21:01:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw all of us stepping back toward the door to watch; some were laughing, some rolling their eyes, and others looking utterly astonished. I saw Lina's body in the wedding dress, as if cruelly severed: most of her head was gone, her stomach was missing, all that remained was one eye, a hand resting on her chin, and two bright red lips, her body tilted sideways, the lines of her crossed legs, and her shoes.\n[1960-09-28T21:02:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I heard Girola couldn't help saying, \"I don't want something like this in my shop.\"  \n\"I agree!\" Pinocchia burst out, \"We sell shoes here; customers will run away when they see this weird thing. Rino! Talk to your sister, please.\"\n[1960-09-28T21:03:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Rino pretending not to notice her, instead speaking to Stefano as if everything that was happening was my brother-in-law's fault. I heard, \"I've already told you, there's no need to discuss it with her. You just need to ask her yes or no. Haven't you seen what's happening now? It's only making us waste time!\"\n[1960-09-28T21:04:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that Stefano didn't respond, just stared at the photo leaning against the wall. Clearly, he was looking for a way out. I heard him ask me, \"Elena, what do you think?\"\n[1960-09-28T21:05:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw myself answering in standard Italian. I heard, \"I think it's great! Of course, it definitely wouldn't work in our Mergellina, it's not suitable for that environment. But here, it's another story—the photo will grab people's attention, everyone is sure to like it. On Confidenza Street, last week at Confidenza, I saw a painting similar to this one in Rosano Blas's house.\"\n[1960-09-28T21:06:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Giyaola become even more angry after hearing my words. \"I heard, 'What do you mean? Are you saying Rosano Blaze knows everything, the two of you know everything, and I and Pinocchia know nothing?'\"\n[1960-09-28T21:07:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that while Giyola was speaking, she had already started muttering: either this way or not at all. I realized then that my situation was dangerous, but as soon as I looked at Lina, I understood: when we first arrived at the store, if she hadn't tried yet, she would have given in. But now that she had tried, she had created an \"unseemly\" picture, and at this point, she would not yield even the slightest bit.\n[1960-09-28T21:08:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I thought she wanted to fight, to destroy, to tear apart—without hesitation, she would rush at Girola with scissors.\n[1960-09-28T21:09:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Marcello looking down, saying not a word. I wished Marcello would speak up, but I understood that his lingering feelings for Lina had also vanished by then, and he could no longer follow her with the same repressed passion as before.\n[1960-09-28T21:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw it was actually his brother Michele who came out to scold his girlfriend Giggia. He spoke in a very domineering tone: \"Stop talking!\" As she was about to try to resist, he didn't even look at her, but instead stared at the photo and said angrily, \"Shut up! Giggia!\" Then he said to Lina. \"I heard, 'Madam, I like your design. You erased those parts, and I know why—you wanted people to see the legs more clearly, to see how beautiful the shoes on the woman's feet are. It's really great! You're a terrible woman, but what you do is always artistic.'\"\n[1960-09-28T21:11:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Giggia wipe away the tears that had slipped down her face. Pinocchia stared at Rino and her brother Stefano, as if saying: speak up! Stand up for me, don't let this wicked woman step on me. I saw that no one was speaking.\n[1960-09-28T21:12:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Stefano just mutter something quietly. I heard, \"Yes, I also think it's good.\"  \nLina immediately said, \"It's not ready yet.\"  \n\"What else do you need?\" Pinocchia couldn't help but ask.  \n\"I just need to add a little color.\"\n[1960-09-28T21:13:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Marcello becoming more and more lost, he whispered, \"Coloring? We're opening in three days.\" Michele laughed. I heard, \"If we need to wait, we'll wait. Hurry up and do it, Mrs. — do whatever you want to do.\"\n[1960-09-28T21:14:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that Stefano wanted to make it clear that his wife had to work. I heard, \"She still has a new Capodimonte to handle.\"  \n\"Make do with it yourself,\" Michele answered, \"we have more interesting things to do here.\" I thought of that master's tone, the way he could say whatever he wanted, which made Stefano very uncomfortable.\n[1960-09-29T10:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw us buying glue, paint, and brushes. We carefully pasted those black pieces of paper onto the picture (she was very particular). We used red or blue pencils to draw the boundary between the parts of the photo that were uncovered and the parts that were covered. I know that in the last few days of September, we were always in the store in the city center, just the two of us and three workers.\n[1960-09-29T11:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I thought Lina had always been good at drawing and color, but at that time she had even more room to express herself, although I couldn't describe exactly what it was, she would sometimes make me feel truly amazed.\n[1960-09-29T12:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I thought it was a very beautiful game, a time of free creativity. Since childhood, perhaps we had never really spent time like that before. Lina pulled me into her fantasies.\n[1960-09-29T14:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I thought for a while that she had created this opportunity just to return to the period when she had first designed shoes, when she was still a girl named Lina-Lina.",

    "text": "[1960-09-29T16:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I thought of how we had forgotten Antonio, Nino, Stefano, the Solara brothers, and my problems with studying, her [pregnancy] body, and the tension between us. Time seemed to have stopped, and we were isolated in a separate space, purely to complete a painting.\n[1960-09-30T10:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I thought quickly, I remembered a word Michele once used: \"erased.\" What he said might be true—those black notes made the shoes on the feet in the photo stand out more, become more noticeable.\n[1960-09-30T11:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw her drawing with black paper, with green and purple circles on certain parts of her body, using blood-red lines to cut herself. I thought to myself that now I was very sure—she wanted to destroy herself through the pictures, right there in the shop that Solara had bought to display and sell her designed shoes, and she would show this self-destruction to everyone.\n[1960-09-30T14:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw her start talking to me about when she first realized she was Mrs. Carraci. I heard her say that in the phrase \"the girl from the Karachi family,\" she saw a locative complement, as if Lina's girl had moved into the Karachi family, and she fell into that name, was absorbed, and then melted.\n[1960-09-30T14:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I heard her mutter, \"It's still like this now.\" I thought of Lina—Lina had been destroyed, she had lost her shape, she had melted into Stefano's outline, becoming his accessory: Signora Carracci. It was then that I began to see what she had meant on that canvas.\n[1960-09-30T17:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I watched until the end, and several workers nervously hung the painting on the wall. We cleaned the store from top to bottom. Lina rearranged the position of the sofa and some decorations.\n[1960-09-30T17:30:00] At the shoe store in front of Piazza Martiri | I saw that in the end, both of us reached the door, admiring the result of our work, and she started to laugh. I saw myself intently looking at the top of the canvas, unable to see Lina's full head—only a very realistic eye emerged from where her head should be, surrounded by the blue and red lights of the night.\n[1960-10-01 08:00:00] School | I saw that school had started, and I was doing well in all my subjects. I thought about how eager I was for Lina to let me help her study Latin or other subjects. I felt that my efforts to study weren't for school, but for her.\n[1960-10-01T15:00:00] Martiri Square | On the day the shoe store opened, Lina came in a convertible. Her husband was driving, and she sat beside him. When she got out of the car, I saw her gaze was hesitant, as if she was worried something bad might happen. I saw her dressed with great care, as if she had stepped out of a fashion magazine.\n[1960-10-01T15:05:00] Qianren Street | When she saw me, she immediately left Stefano and pulled me with her to look at the shop windows on the Street of a Thousand.\n[1960-10-01T15:10:00] Qianren Street | \"I remember the girl in the green dress,\" she suddenly said, \"the one with the cylinder hat?\"\n[1960-10-01T15:11:00] Qianren Street | I said, \"It's just a matter of money, Lina. Everything has changed now. You're much more beautiful than that girl in the green dress.\" I thought, of course I remember, fear. I understood what she wanted me to say to reassure her.\n[1960-10-01T15:12:00] Qianren Street | I thought about it, but it wasn't true—I was lying. There was a kind of malice, an inequality, and now I understood that it was something deeper, something beyond money. The income from the two Capodimontes, plus the shoe workshop, or even the shoe store in the city center couldn't hide our origins.\n[1960-10-01T15:30:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that we had returned to the store. Many cars were parked in a messy pile in front of the shop, and the inside was full of people, creating a lively, bustling atmosphere. I watched the entire afternoon celebration, which seemed a bit like a wedding: food, pastries, and a lot of wine.\n[1960-10-01T15:35:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Lina's enlarged photo up high. Some people would stop and watch with interest, others would cast doubtful glances, and some even would laugh. I couldn't take my eyes off the photo; it was no longer recognizable as her, but instead had become a terrifying and seductive image—a one-eyed goddess, stretching the foot in her beautiful shoes toward the center of the hall.\n[1960-10-01T16:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw in the crowd, and what surprised me most was Alfonso Carracci, who was so lively, happy, and elegant. Lina also looked at him for a long time, looking somewhat uneasy. I heard myself laughing as I said to her, \"He's not him anymore.\"  \n\"What happened?\"  \n\"I don't know.\"\n[1960-10-01T16:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw him come over to us later, speaking in a very confident and elegant manner, praising our handling of the photos. At that moment, he was very at ease, having overcome his shyness in front of my sister-in-law. I heard him say, \"I've always known you're a very dangerous person,\" then he kissed her cheek.\n[1960-10-01T16:11:00] The shoe store at Martiri Square | I saw myself looking around anxiously, watching him. Did I think about the danger? What did he see in that portrait that I failed to notice? Alfonso Carracci didn't stop at the surface; he saw something deeper?\n[1960-10-01T17:30:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that it was getting dark, and suddenly something outside lit up. The Solara brothers and their grandfather, parents, and every member of their family ran out to see, all of them unusually excited. I saw them come onto the street, at the entrance of the shop, above the window there were a few bright words: Solara.\n[1960-10-01T17:31:00] At the shoe store in front of Piazza Martiri | I saw Lina make a scornful face and said to me. I heard, \"They also made some concessions in this regard.\"\n[1960-10-01T17:32:00] At the entrance of the shoe store in Piazza Martiri | I saw her push me toward Rino, who looked happier than anyone else. Lina said unhappily. I heard, \"If all the shoes were 'Lina' brand, why is the store called Solara?\"\n[1960-10-01T17:33:00] At the shoe store in front of Piazza Martiri | I saw Rino grab her arm and say softly. I heard, \"Lina, why do you always have to ruin the mood? It's so annoying. Do you remember the trouble you got me into here a few years ago? What am I supposed to do now, are you going to cause more trouble? 'Lina' shoes, Solara shop. What do you want to write above the store? Karachi?\"\n[1960-10-01T17:34:00] The shoe store at the entrance of Martiri Square | I saw Lina shake off his arm and calmly say to him. \"I heard you say, 'I'm very calm now, quite calm. What I want to tell you is: don't ask me for anything anymore. What are you doing now? You borrowed money from Signora Solara, didn't you? They made Stefano borrow money too, didn't they? You're all people who owe others money, so you agree to every demand they make? From now on, we'll each take care of ourselves, Rino.'\"\n[1960-10-01T17:35:00] Martiri Square | I saw her walk away, straight to Michele, looking cheerful and enchanting. I saw her and Michele reach the square, where they circled the stone lions in the square. Her husband's eyes never left her.\n[1960-10-01T18:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that at this moment, the store had become empty, and someone had turned off the outside neon sign. I saw the square suddenly grow dark, and the streetlights began to turn on.\n[1960-10-01T18:05:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Lina smiling as she left Michele, but when she entered the store, her face was expressionless and very pale. She went into the small bathroom and locked the door behind her.\n[1960-10-01T18:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Lina come out of the bathroom, and Stefano, who had been lurking outside, suddenly grabbed her arm. She impatiently shook him off and then came over to me.\n[1960-10-01T18:11:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I heard her mutter, \"I'm bleeding a bit. What's happening? Did the baby fall out?\" I saw her face was very pale.\n[1960-11-01 10:00:00] School | I saw that I had become the top student in the class. I know I didn't do that well in elementary school either.",

    "text": "[1960-12-20T10:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her full of energy again, pouring a lot of effort into managing the store. I knew that sales had surged on Christmas Eve, and within just a few months, it had already surpassed Mergellina's Capodimonte.\n[1960-12-20T20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Maria often helping at her daughter-in-law's shop instead of her son's. Stefano always had a sour face, partly because he had lost his child, and partly because the business was too busy. I know that Maria's admiration for Lina is growing.\n[1960-12-20T20:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Pinocchio strictly forbidding her mother from coming to the shop, afraid of embarrassing herself in front of customers. I know that Pinocchio is now working in the shop on Martiri Square.\n[1960-12-20T21:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano and Pinocchia always blaming Lina, saying she couldn't even carry a child. Every time, old Mrs. Carracci would step in to defend the young Mrs. Carracci. I heard \"She doesn't want children.\" Stefano complained.\n[1960-12-20T21:01:00] Lina's house | \"I also think that way,\" Pinocchia always immediately supported her brother's opinion. \"She still wants to be a girl; she doesn't know how to be a wife.\"\n[1960-12-20T21:02:00] Lina's House | I saw Maria scold the two children very severely. I heard her say, \"You shouldn't even think about such things, let alone talk about them. Heaven gave us our child, and it will take the child back. I never want to hear you say such foolish things again.\"\n[1960-12-20T21:03:00] Lina's house | I saw my daughter shouting angrily. I heard, \"Shut up! You gave the earrings I liked to that annoying woman!\"\n[1960-12-21T09:00:00] School | I knew their arguments and Lina's reactions soon became the talk of Mergellina, and sometimes even reached my ears. But I didn't pay much attention to these things, because school had started. I thought about it, but the way things unfolded surprised me.\n[1960-12-21T10:00:00] School | I thought back to the beginning of the school term, when my studies had always been ahead, as if Antonio's departure, Nino's disappearance, and even Lina's life getting back on track, starting to run Capodimonte, had untangled some knots in my mind.\n[1960-12-21T11:00:00] School | I realized that I could clearly and accurately recall what I had learned in my first year of high school, and I could quickly and fluently answer the teacher's questions.\n[1960-12-25T10:00:00] School | I saw that, not only that, but Teacher Galiani was also very attentive to me. I thought it might be because she had lost Nino—the most promising of her students—so she turned her attention to me.\n[1960-12-28T10:00:00] School | I heard her say that I could join a peace-promoting hike from Lecce to San Gregorio Armeno, which would be meaningful and also beneficial for my growth.\n[1960-12-30T09:00:00] Posillipo | I decided to go, but because my mother wanted me to take along a few of my younger brothers, we quarreled and shouted, and in the end, I left late. I thought about it partly out of curiosity, and also because I was worried that if I refused, Professor Galiani might get angry. Another reason was that the hike would pass along the main road near our residence Mergellina, which wouldn't take much effort.\n[1960-12-30T10:00:00] Bridge above | I saw myself and several of my brothers arriving at a bridge, and I looked down. I saw the people in the demonstration blocking the road, not letting cars pass. They were all ordinary people, and it didn't look like a real protest at all—more like they were walking around with flags and signs.\n[1960-12-30T10:05:00] On the bridge | I wanted to go find Teacher Galiani and have her see me, so I told my younger brothers to wait for me on the bridge. I thought this was a terrible idea.\n[1960-12-30T10:10:00] Bridge on | I saw that as soon as I turned around, before I could find the teacher, my younger brothers had already gathered with other boys from Mergellina, throwing stones at the procession and cursing loudly.\n[1960-12-30T10:15:00] On the bridge | I saw them and immediately ran back to find them, sweating all over, and took them away. I thought about how worried I was that Teacher Galiani's sharp eyes would see them, recognize them as my brothers.\n[1961-01-10T15:00:00] Posillipo | I knew it would end like this, several weeks had passed, and school was about to start a new term, so we needed to buy new books. I thought about showing my mother the list of books I needed, asking her to talk to my father and get money from him, but it was useless because I knew he had no money.\n[1961-01-15T15:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her in August or September, I went to the hospital twice. The first time I went, she was asleep. The second time, I found that she had been discharged, but she hadn't gone home. I know that Teacher Oliviero also has no news.\n[1961-01-20T16:00:00] Mergellina | I saw in early November, I went to her neighbor to ask. I knew that because her health was poor, she had gone to live with a sister in Potenza, and I didn't know if she would return to San Gregorio Armeno or come back to this Mergellina to continue teaching.\n[1961-02-01T10:00:00] School | I realized I had no other choice, so I tried asking Alfonso Carracci if his brother had bought him any books, so I could use them. He was very happy and suggested that we study together. I knew we could study at Lina's house, because since she'd been busy at Capodimonte, her home was empty from seven in the morning until nine at night, and that's how we decided.\n[1961-02-15T09:00:00] School | I saw that one morning, Alfonso Carracci reluctantly told me. I heard, \"You should go to Capodimonte and find Lina today, she wants to see you.\" I thought he must know the reason, but Lina made him swear to stay silent, so I could never get the answer out of him.\n[1961-02-15T15:00:00] New Capodimonte | I remember that afternoon, I went to Capodimonte. Pinocchia was somewhat conflicted, she showed me a postcard from her boyfriend Enzo Scanno. I didn't know which small town in Piedmont it had come from.\n[1961-02-15T15:05:00] New Capodimonte | I saw that Lina had also received a postcard, from Antonio. I thought at first that she had made me run over just to show me the postcard. But she didn't let me see the postcard, nor did she tell me what was written on it.\n[1961-02-15T15:10:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her pull me into the room inside the store, excitedly asking me. I heard him say, \"Do you remember our bet?\" I nodded. \"Do you remember that you lost?\" I nodded again. \"Do you remember that from now on, you can't score lower than eight in any exam?\" I nodded once more.\n[1961-02-15T15:15:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her pointing to two large packages wrapped in wrapping paper, which were the school textbooks.\n[1961-02-15T16:00:00] Posillipo | I saw those books were heavy. I returned home very excited, only to find that the books weren't old. The books that Professor Oliviero had previously found for me were all secondhand, usually smelling terrible. I saw that the book Lina had given me was a new one, still smelling of ink, and among these books there were also some dictionaries: \"Zingarelli,\" \"Rossi,\" and \"Caronci-Giorgi,\" all of which the teacher had never managed to get.\n[1961-02-15T16:10:00] Posillipo | I saw her suddenly start crying when she saw me opening the books' packaging. I know that no matter what happens to me, my mother always says something contemptuous.\n[1961-02-15T16:11:00] Posillipo | I saw myself running to her immediately and touching her arm with my hand. I was surprised and a bit frightened by her unusual behavior. It was hard to say what had moved her: maybe it was the generosity of the owner of Capodimonte, or perhaps her helplessness in the face of poverty—I didn't know.\n[1961-02-15T16:15:00] Posillipo | I saw her calm down quickly, muttering a few words I didn't catch, then she went back to her own business.",

    "text": "[1961-02-15T17:00:00] My small room | I know that in the small room where I and my younger brothers lived, there was a small table made by piecing together different pieces of wood, covered with many insect holes. I usually did my homework at that table.\n[1961-02-15T17:10:00] My small room | I saw myself placing all the books on the table, watching them neatly lined up against the wall. I thought of it and suddenly felt full of energy.\n[1961-03-01T15:00:00] School | I saw time rushing by, and I returned the books that Teacher Galiani had lent me during the summer. She lent me other books, which were even more difficult to understand.\n[1961-03-05T10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that I read these books very carefully every Sunday, but I didn't understand much. I read line by line, turning the pages. I thought about it, but those long, complex sentences annoyed me—I couldn't figure out what the words really meant.\n[1961-03-10T20:00:00] Posillipo | I spent my entire sophomore year studying while reading these difficult books. I thought about how I found it hard, but I was satisfied, feeling that all the efforts were worth it.\n[1961-03-15T10:00:00] School | I remember one day when Teacher Galiani asked me, \"Grego, which newspaper are you reading?\"\n[1961-03-15T10:01:00] School | I felt extremely embarrassed thinking about this, just like I had felt that time at Lina's wedding when I was talking with Nino. Professor Galiani naturally assumed that I also read the newspaper at home, but in the environment where I lived, reading the newspaper was not a normal thing to do.\n[1961-03-15T10:02:00] School | I tried desperately to recall what newspaper Pasquale, as a communist, was reading, but I couldn't remember anything. I thought about how I could tell her that my father never bought newspapers, and I had never read a newspaper. I felt I couldn't bring myself to say it.\n[1961-03-15T10:03:00] School | At that moment, I remembered Donato Nino reading the newspaper on the beach of Vomero, and I remembered that he had written an article for Il Messaggero, so I replied. I heard, \"I read Il Messaggero.\"\n[1961-03-15T10:04:00] School | From that day on, she started showing me the newspapers she had read. She would buy two newspapers, sometimes three, and during school dismissal, she would give me one. I saw my teacher's face break into a slightly mocking smile.\n[1961-03-15T12:00:00] On the way home | I saw myself thanking her. I thought about the way home, and I felt unusually heavy, which was yet another homework assignment for me.\n[1961-03-20T19:00:00] Posillipo | At first, I used to leave the newspaper lying around the house, planning to read it after finishing my homework, but by evening, I found the newspaper was gone. I know my father has taken over the newspaper; he reads it in bed, or in the bathroom.\n[1961-03-21T23:00:00] Posillipo | I saw and so I changed my \"strategy,\" hiding the newspaper between the pages of my textbook, only taking it out at night when everyone was asleep.\n[1961-03-25T23:30:00] Posillipo | I flipped through my columns one by one, not out of personal interest, but out of duty, just like schoolwork. I know that sometimes the teacher gives me L'Unità, and sometimes Il Messaggero or Corriere della Sera. I thought about it, but I felt both of these newspapers were hard for me to understand. It was like reading a series of comic books and picking up one in the middle without knowing what had happened before. I hope that the parts I don't understand today, if I keep at it, I'll eventually be able to understand them.\n[1961-04-01 10:00:00] Home | I saw that year, my chest, thighs, and buttocks became increasingly full. I thought to myself that I felt like I was rising like pizza dough.\n[1961-04-01T14:00:00] New Capodimonte | I sometimes ran home right after school, finished my homework, and then went to meet her at the new Capodimonte. I know that during that time, I met Lina very few times.\n[1961-04-01T14:10:00] New Capodimonte | I see myself eating a sandwich hungrily, and I'll say some sentences in standard Italian that I've learned from books or from Professor Galiani's newspaper. I told her I was hungry, and she immediately made me a sandwich with lots of meat and cheese inside.\n[1961-04-01T14:15:00] New Capodimonte | I heard myself saying the cruel things that happened in the Nazi concentration camps, and what people could have done now. I also mentioned the threat of nuclear war to human peace. In short, we have tamed nature with the tools we have invented, but now our tools have become even more terrifying than nature itself. I spoke about the need for a civilization that fights against human suffering, and how we must eliminate the suffering humanity endures.\n[1961-04-01T14:16:00] New Capodimonte | I heard that religion would disappear from people's consciousness, and we would build a world where everyone is equal, without class differences, and people would have a more scientific and rational understanding of society and life. I thought about all the things I said to her. On one hand, I wanted to show her that I had a chance to get an eight in every subject. On the other hand, I didn't really know what to say to her, and another reason was that I hoped she would challenge me, so we could have discussions like before.\n[1961-04-01T14:20:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her, but she hardly said anything; sometimes she seemed a bit embarrassed, as if she didn't understand what I was saying. Or she would say a few words, and end with expressions like: she started talking about where Don Achille's money came from, and the money of the Solara family. I know that sometimes I said these things in front of Pinocchia, and Pinocchia quickly expressed her agreement. I thought about why she brought up the issue again.\n[1961-04-01T14:25:00] New Capodimonte | When a customer came in to buy something, she immediately stopped talking, became very polite and attentive, quickly cut the item, weighed it, and took the money.\n[1961-04-10T15:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw once when she looked into an open drawer, staring at the money inside, and her expression looked very bad. I heard her say, \"All this money was earned by me and Pinocchia through hard work, but none of it is mine, Elena. This money belongs to Stefano. Stefano's money came from his father. Without Don Achille's money made through the black market and usury—those hidden under the mattress—there would be no shop, no cobbler's workshop.\"\n[1961-04-10T15:01:00] New Capodimonte | I heard, \"Not only that, Stefano, Rino, and even my father—without the Solara family's connections and the money they lent, they wouldn't have sold a single pair of shoes. The Solaras are also loan sharks. You can see my current situation, can't you?\"\n[1961-04-10T15:02:00] New Capodimonte | \"I know all that is in the past,\" I said to her, bringing up the conclusion we had reached when she was engaged to Stefano, \"What you're talking about is over. We are different from those people.\" I thought she had spoken clearly, but I didn't understand what purpose her words served.\n[1961-04-10T15:03:00] New Capodimonte | I heard her say to me, \"I don't like the things I've done, and I don't like the things I'm doing now.\" I thought of these words, which had originally been hers, but she wasn't very sure about them now. I remember this sentence very clearly; at the time, she had spoken it in dialect.\n[1961-04-10T15:05:00] New Capodimonte | I thought she might have started seeing Pasquale again, because he's always had that kind of attitude. I thought their friendship was growing stronger, because Pasquale was now engaged to Pina, the salesgirl from the old Capodimonte, and Pasquale was Pina's brother. Now Pina was running the new Capodimonte with her.\n[1961-04-10T15:30:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I wasn't happy when I left Capodimonte. I thought about how I was struggling very hard to suppress a complex I'd had since childhood, a painful feeling—back then, Lina and Pinochia became friends, and they started to exclude me.",

They parked the car beside me.\n[1961-04-15 15:06:00] Small Park | I saw the two brothers, both handsome, with dark, shiny hair and white teeth when they smiled. I thought of them, but between the two, I preferred Marcello; he looked like Ettore—the character in the illustrations of our Iliad textbook.\n[1961-04-15 15:07:00] Small Park | I saw them following me all the time. I was walking on the sidewalk, and they were on the road, sitting in that \"Fiat 1100\" car.\n[1961-04-15 15:08:00] Small Park | I heard, \"Have you ever ridden in a car?\" \"No.\"\n[1961-04-15 15:09:00] Small Park | \"I heard, 'Come up, we'll give you a ride.' 'My father won't agree.'\"\n[1961-04-15 15:10:00] Small Park | I heard, \"We won't tell him. When will you ever get a chance to ride in such a fancy car again?\"\n[1961-04-15 15:11:00] Small Park | I saw it, but I kept saying \"No,\" and quickened my pace toward the small park. I thought, never, I thought.\n[1961-04-15 15:12:00] Small Park | I saw their car speed off, and in the blink of an eye, it disappeared behind the buildings under construction.\n[1961-04-15 15:13:00] Small Park | I thought about how I had refused them, because if my father found out I had gotten into their car, even though he was a gentle, good man who loved me very much, he would surely have beaten me to death.\n[1961-04-15 15:14:00] Small Park | I thought of my two younger brothers, Peppe and Gianni, who, even though they were very young, would feel obligated to kill the Solara brothers once they grew up.\n[1961-04-15 15:15:00] Small Park | I knew there were no written rules, but everyone knew how things worked, including the Solara brothers.\n[1961-04-15 15:20:00] Small Park | I have to say, they've always been very polite, they just invited me into the car. I know that later, in front of Pinocchia, they weren't so polite anymore.\n[1961-04-15 15:21:00] Small Park | I knew Pinocchia was the crazy widow—the eldest daughter of Melina Antonio, the widow who had made a fool of herself when Nino moved away.\n[1961-04-15 15:22:00] Small Park | I saw Pinocchia when she was fourteen. On Sundays, she would secretly put on lipstick, betraying her mother. Her legs were long and straight, her chest larger than mine, giving her a mature and beautiful appearance.\n[1961-04-15 15:25:00] Street | I saw the Solara brothers saying disgusting things to her. Michele grabbed one of her arms and opened the car door, pulling her inside.\n[1961-04-15 16:30:00] Street | An hour later, I saw them return Pinocchio to her place. She seemed a bit angry, but she was also smiling.\n[1961-04-15T23:00:00] Posillipo | I was reading Il Messaggero one night when, too tired, my eyes were about to close. Suddenly, I jolted awake as if struck by electricity. I came across an unsigned short review that was about the shoe store in Piazza Martiri, and the article praised the wooden panels that I and Lina had created together. I found it almost unbelievable.\n[1961-04-15T23:05:00] Posillipo | I read it again and again. I remember a few lines now: in a shoe store on Piazza Martiri, there was an artistic creation that mixed text and color. Unfortunately, the two girls who ran the store wouldn't tell me the name of the artist who made it. But in any case, he was certainly an avant-garde artist. With a pure, unique power that seemed almost divine, he revealed an intense, inner sorrow through his images, and it was very expressive.\n[1961-04-15T23:10:00] Posillipo | I know there were many other praise-filled words that extolled the entire shoe store, saying it was a significant manifestation of the vitality of San Gregorio Armeno's business in recent years.\n[1961-04-16 10:00:00] Street | I told Antonio, Pinocchia's brother, that I had seen the Solara brothers force Pinocchia into a car. I know he works as a mechanic in the Glacio workshop.\n[1961-04-16 10:05:00] Street | I know that Antonio works very hard, is disciplined, and is also shy. I realized that his father's early death and his mother's madness had deeply wounded him.\n[1961-04-16 17:00:00] At the entrance of Capodimonte | I saw him not telling his relatives and friends, but going alone to the door of Solara's bar to wait for Marcello and Michele.\n[1961-04-16 17:10:00] At the entrance of Capodimonte | As soon as the two brothers appeared, he didn't say a word and immediately attacked.\n[1961-04-16 17:15:00] At the entrance of Capodimonte | I saw the first few minutes, and he was on top, but then the father of the Solara brothers and a bartender came out, and the four of them teamed up, beating Antonio until he was covered in blood.\n[1961-04-16 17:16:00] At the entrance of Capodimonte | I saw that at this moment, neither the people passing by nor the customers in the bar made any move to help him.\n[1961-04-16T07:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that I had not slept all night.\n[1961-04-16T14:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her the day after school ended, and I immediately ran to find Lina. I knew the store was empty—Pinocchia had gone home to take care of her mother, Giuseppina was sick, and Lina was on the phone with a supplier from the countryside, complaining that he hadn't delivered the water buffalo mozzarella or fresh cheese. I wasn't exactly sure.\n[1961-04-16T14:05:00] New Capodimonte | I saw and heard her shouting and swearing a lot. I thought about it and was very shocked. I was thinking that the person on the other end of the phone might be an old man who would get angry and send his son to take revenge. I thought, why did she have to make such a big deal out of it.\n[1961-04-16T14:10:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her hang up the phone and let out a contemptuous sigh, then explained to me. I heard, \"If I didn't say it that way, they wouldn't listen to me.\"\n[1961-04-16T14:15:00] New Capodimonte | I saw myself showing her the newspaper, and she glanced at it carelessly. I heard, \"I've already seen it.\" I knew she explained that it was Michele's idea, as usual, he never discussed anything with anyone.\n[1961-04-16T14:20:00] New Capodimonte | \"I see,\" she said, walking to the checkout counter and pulling open the drawer. She took out some clippings and handed them to me.\n[1961-04-16T14:25:00] New Capodimonte | I knew those articles were also talking about the shops in Martirano Square. There was a short piece published in Il Messaggero that lavishly praised the Solara brothers, but said nothing at all about the chalkboard.\n[1961-04-16T14:30:00] New Capodimonte | I know there was another article published in the \"San Gregorio Armeno Evening News,\" spanning three columns, which praised the store as if it were a palace. The article used an extremely exaggerated written style to describe the store's atmosphere, praising its interior decoration, luxurious lighting, and especially the shoes. It also praised the two elegant, gentle, and polite girls, meaning Miss Gigia Spagnuolo and Miss Giuseppina Caracci.\n[1961-04-16T14:35:00] New Capodimonte | I know that the painting was only mentioned at the end of the article, and not much was said about it. It was described as a vulgar piece, an incongruous note in this elegant and luxurious setting.\n[1961-04-16T14:40:00] New Capodimonte | I heard Lina ask me in a teasing tone, \"Did you see the signature below?\" I knew the article on Il Messaggero was signed with the abbreviation D.S, and the one at the end of the article in San Gregorio Armeno Evening Paper was signed Donato Nino—the father of Nino.\n[1961-04-16T14:41:00] New Capodimonte | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n\"What do you think?\"\n\"What can I say?\"\n\"You should say, 'Like father, like son.'\"\n[1961-04-16T14:45:00] New Capodimonte | I saw her smile, but it wasn't happy at all. She explained that the \"Lina\" shoes and the Solara shoe store were becoming more successful every day, so Michele decided to expand his influence. He was giving gifts everywhere, and because of this, the newspapers in this city were all talking positively about the Solara shoe store.\n[1961-04-16T14:50:00] New Capodimonte | I heard her say to me, none of the words in these articles were true. I thought about it and it made me very sad. I felt she shouldn't have belittled those newspapers. I had worked so hard reading them, even sacrificing my sleep.\n[1961-04-16T14:51:00] New Capodimonte | I didn't like how she emphasized Nino's relationship with the authors of the two articles, linking Nino to his father—a man who wrote flashy, fake pieces. Was that necessary?\n[1961-04-20 16:00:00] Courtyard | I know that when it comes to this matter, we girls have split into two factions. Girolama Spagnuolo and Camilla Peluso support the Solara brothers because they're good-looking and have a car.\n[1961-04-20 16:05:00] Courtyard | I found myself, in front of these two friends, leaning towards Solara, pretending to be very impressed by them. I thought about my hesitation.\n[1961-04-20 16:10:00] Yard | I thought they were really handsome, something we found hard to resist. We imagined ourselves sitting in a car, sitting next to one of them.",

    "text": "[1961-04-20 16:15:00] Courtyard | I thought about how terrible their performance was in front of Pinocchia. Antonio wasn't very handsome, not like the Solara brothers who were muscular and went to the gym every day, but he had the courage to challenge them.\n[1961-04-20 16:20:00] Courtyard | I saw Lina expressing her opinion without hesitation, and she thought the same way I did. So, in front of Lina, I also spoke my true thoughts.\n[1961-04-20 16:25:00] Courtyard | I remember once, we had a very heated discussion. I thought maybe because she didn't develop as well as we did, she didn't know the pleasure and fear of being noticed by the Solara brothers.\n[1961-04-20 16:30:00] Courtyard | I saw her even paler than usual. She said that if something like what happened to Pinochia had happened to her, she wouldn't have troubled her father and her brother Rino; she would have dealt with the two brothers herself.\n[1961-04-20 16:31:00] Courtyard | \"I heard 'Marcello and Michele don't even look at you.' Girolama Spagnuolo said.\n[1961-04-20 16:32:00] Courtyard | I saw that we thought Lina would be angry, but she said seriously. I heard, \"That's best.\"\n[1961-04-25 15:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her, still as thin as before, but very firm. I looked at her hands in astonishment: in a short time, her hands would become like her brother Rino's and her father's, with thick, yellow calluses on their fingers.\n[1961-04-25 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that she had also started doing some work, threading needles, unsewing, applying glue, and hemming. She was now handling Fernando's tools almost as skillfully as her brother. I knew that although no one was forcing her—working in the shop wasn't her job.\n[1961-05-01 10:00:00] Unknown | I knew that's why she stopped asking me about Latin that year.\n[1961-05-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that, because of the praise in the newspaper, Solara's shoe shop and the \"Lina\" shoes soon became well known. Since the newspaper mentioned the names of Giggia and Pinochia, both of them took every opportunity to show off.\n[1961-05-01T12:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I knew that the store's success didn't ease their relationship. Each of them felt she was the key to the store's success and saw the other as a stumbling block to its further development. But they were united in one thing: Lina's photo was a disgrace.\n[1961-05-01T13:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw how they treated those who came out of curiosity to look at the photos. They cut out the articles from Il Messaggero and Il Messaggero, put them in frames, and hung them up.\n[1961-05-15 15:00:00] Unknown | I later heard her tell me her thoughts, but they had nothing to do with books: she wanted to convince her father to make the new shoes, but Fernando didn't even want to talk about it.\n[1961-05-15 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard my father tell her that making handmade shoes had no future. Now there were many machines, those machines were expensive and required a lot of money, but the money wasn't in the bank—it was with loan sharks. The Lina family didn't have that kind of money.\n[1961-05-15 15:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that she still stuck to her own opinion, and said a lot of good things to my father. I heard, \"Dad, no one makes shoes as well as you do.\"\n[1961-05-15 15:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him say. I heard that, despite the fact, nowadays all the shoes are factory-made, mass-produced, and cost very little.\n[1961-05-15 15:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I'd heard he'd worked in the factory and knew just how bad those shoes were that ended up on the market, but there was nothing we could do—people who wanted new shoes no longer went to the local cobblers, but instead bought them from stores in the Rettifilo district.\n[1961-05-15 15:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard that even if you make the shoes properly, they still won't sell, it's a waste of effort and you'll end up losing money.\n[1961-05-15T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that from Christmas to Carnival, the Solara and Calogero families made a lot of money. Especially Stefano, who was relieved. The new and old Capodimonte both brought in good profits, the \"Lina\" handcrafted shoe workshop was working at full capacity, and there was also the shop above Martiri Square. I thought this confirmed what he had always expected: Lina's shoes, designed in her early years, were not only selling well in the Rettifilo district, Via Favia, and Via Garibaldi, but had also gained the approval of the wealthy.\n[1961-05-20 14:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that Lina wasn't being swayed by her father as usual; she pulled Rino to her side. I know that at first, her brother was on father's side because he found Lina annoying; after all, he was the real expert at making shoes. Now Lina doesn't talk about studying anymore, but instead gives orders about work.\n[1961-05-25 14:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that later, he was gradually persuaded by his sister's tempting prospects in the shoe business, and began arguing with Fernando, frequently talking back, saying the same things that Lina had said.\n[1961-05-25 14:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"We should at least try.\" \"No way.\"\n[1961-05-25 14:06:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Have you seen the car from the Solara family? Have you seen how successful the Mask Loc 013 business is for the Carracci family?\"\n[1961-05-25 14:07:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"I saw the woman who ran the sewing supply store wanted to open a ready-to-wear shop, but she gave up later. I also saw Glacio's repair shop, because of his foolish son, Ma's steps were longer than his legs.\"\n[1961-05-25 14:08:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'But the Solara family's shop is getting bigger and bigger.' 'Mind your own business and don't worry about the Solaras.'\"\n[1961-05-25 14:09:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"A new neighborhood is going to be built next to the railway.\" \"What's that got to do with us?\"\n[1961-05-25 14:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Dad, those people made money, and now they want to spend it.\"\n[1961-05-25 14:11:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard him say, 'People spend money on food because they have to eat every day. Shoes can't be eaten; secondly, if shoes break, you can have them repaired and wear them for twenty years. At present, our job is to repair shoes, we don't do anything else.'\"\n[1961-05-25 14:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I really like Rino because he has always been very polite to me, but sometimes he can also summon courage and be very firm, which even makes his father a little afraid.\n[1961-05-25 14:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that at any time, anywhere, he was always supporting his sister. I thought about how jealous I was of Lina having such a brother, so firmly supporting her.\n[1961-05-25 14:30:00] Home | I sometimes think the difference between me and her is that I only have a younger brother, so no one encouraged me or opposed my mother, allowing me to think for myself; while Lina could rely on Rino, who would protect his sister in front of anyone, and no matter what she thought, her older brother would always support her.\n[1961-05-25 14:35:00] Home | You could say that, but I think Fernando made sense, and I agreed more with his point of view. When I discussed this with Lina, I found that she thought the same way.\n[1961-06-01 15:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I remember once she showed me a drawing, a design for shoes that she and her brother had drawn together, both men's and women's shoes.\n[1961-06-01 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the design sketches, which were very beautiful, drawn on grid paper, with rich details and precise colors. I saw that she had examined those shoes from close up, the ones that didn't belong to our world, and after seeing them, she drew them.\n[1961-06-01 15:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I realized that the shoes were actually her design, every detail was her imagination, just like the princesses she drew when she was in elementary school. I know the shoes she painted; they look very ordinary, but they don't look like the shoes sold at Mergellina at all, not even the ones on the actresses' feet in the photo novel.\n[1961-06-01 15:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Do you like it?\" \"These shoes are elegant.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:16:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Rino says these shoes are hard to make.\" \"Will he make them then?\"\n[1961-06-01 15:17:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"He said he was sure he could do it.\" \"What about your father?\"\n[1961-06-01 15:18:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"He certainly can do it.\" \"Then you do it.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:19:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'Dad doesn't want to do it.'\" \"Why?\"\n[1961-06-01 15:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard him say, \"I can play around, but he and Rino can't waste their time following me.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:21:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard 'What do you mean?' 'It means that if we actually go through with it, it'll take time and money.'\"\n[1961-06-01 15:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that, she showed me the account she had carefully calculated for Rino.\n[1961-06-01 15:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her trying to find out how much it would cost to make these shoes, and finally she stopped, folding up those crumpled pages.\n[1961-06-01 15:31:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard her tell me that her father was right, it was a waste of time.\n[1961-06-01 15:32:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'So what are you going to do?' 'We still have to try.'\"\n[1961-06-01 15:33:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Fernando will get angry.\" \"If we don't even try, everything will stay the same.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that she wanted to change the situation, but it was still the same topic. I heard that we were supposed to go from poor to rich, from having nothing to having everything.\n[1961-06-01 15:36:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I mentioned to her our previous plan: to get rich by writing novels, like the author of Little Women. I know I'm still stuck here, still care a lot, and still studying Latin for this goal.\n[1961-06-01 15:37:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know that deep down I believe that, although she no longer goes to school and is now focused on making shoes, she has borrowed so many books from Professor Ferraro's mobile library. I thought it was about writing a novel together and making a lot of money.\n[1961-06-01 15:38:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw and heard my words, and she shrugged. I thought of putting on an indifferent expression.\n[1961-06-01 15:39:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that her thoughts about Little Women had changed, and she explained to me that now, to truly become rich, one had to do business. I heard they could make a pair of shoes first and show them to her father, demonstrating how beautiful and comfortable they were.\n[1961-06-01 15:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard that once Fernando was convinced, production could start: two pairs today, four pairs tomorrow, thirty pairs a month, four hundred pairs a year. Soon she would be able to build a shoe factory—Lina Factory—with her father, Rino, her mother, and a few brothers, employing at least fifty workers, making shoes with machines.\n[1961-06-01 15:41:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"A shoe factory?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:42:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw how she spoke about the factory with confidence. I saw her sketch the image of a factory before me, speaking in her usual tone, in Italian.\n[1961-06-01 15:43:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard that the \"Lina\" brand will be stamped on the upper part of the shoes, and they will produce a \"Lina\" product line. The designs are all beautiful and elegant. She said that when you wear \"Lina\" shoes, they are so comfortable and beautiful that you don't want to take them off even when going to bed at night.\n[1961-06-01 15:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that we all were laughing. I thought the idea was interesting.\n[1961-06-01 15:46:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina stop at last. I thought, as if realizing we were just joking, just like many years ago when we put Tina and Nuo in the cellar vent and played with the dolls together.\n[1961-06-01 15:47:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her say to me that she was eager to explain: it was a very concrete and feasible thing. I thought of her acting like a little adult, and later, this pretense of maturity became one of her main characteristics in my eyes.\n[1961-06-01 15:48:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'Do you know why the Solara brothers think they are the masters of this Mergellina?' 'Because they act like bullies.'\"\n[1961-06-01 15:49:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"No, because they're rich.\" \"Do you really think so?\"\n[1961-06-01 15:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'Of course, you saw it? They never bother Pinocchio Caracci.' 'Indeed.'\"\n[1961-06-01 15:51:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Do you know why they treated Pinocchio that way?\" \"No.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:52:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard her say, \"Because Pinocchio has no father, she helps Melina clean the hallway and stairs, and her brother Antonio isn't much help either. So we have to earn money ourselves, more than the Solaras. We have to make it clear to those two brothers that we're not to be messed with.\"\n[1961-06-01 15:55:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her show me a very sharp leather knife, which she had taken from her father's shop.\n[1961-06-01 15:56:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard her say, 'They won't touch me because I'm ugly and I haven't started my period yet, but they'll harass you. If something happens, tell me.'\"\n[1961-06-01 15:57:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I looked at her, very confused. I thought about how we were only thirteen years old, didn't understand anything, didn't know about the law, justice, or state institutions.\n[1961-06-01 15:58:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how we were just imitating what we had seen and heard since childhood, but we never really knew for sure: wasn't justice always gained through fighting?\n[1961-06-01 15:59:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know that Peruzzo killed Don Achille, right?",

    "text": "[1961-06-01 16:30:00] Home | I thought about going home, and I realized that the last things she said proved she cared about me, which made me feel very happy.\n[1961-06-01T10:00:00] Outskirts | Starting from the second year, I saw that some imitation \"Lina\" shoes had already appeared in the display windows of shoe stores in the suburbs. I knew those shoes were basically identical to the ones Lina designed, just with slight modifications to the decoration on the upper part. Michele immediately stopped the sale of the counterfeit versions through protest and intimidation, and the matter was settled, but it didn't end there.\n[1961-06-15T20:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw one evening when Michele gathered his brother Marcello, the Carraccis, Rino, of course Girolama and Pinocchia, to a meeting in the store on Martiri Square. I knew that what was unexpected was that Stefano came alone, and Lina didn't come, saying she was very tired and apologized sincerely.\n[1961-06-15T20:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I heard Michele say that Lina wasn't coming, so what the hell were we talking about? I knew that the Solara brothers were very upset about Lina's absence. These words annoyed Giggia.\n[1961-06-15T20:20:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw it, but Rino immediately intervened. He announced that he and his father had been considering it for a long time and planned to introduce some new designs at the exhibition in Arezzo in September. I know, but it's obvious he's lying.\n[1961-06-15T20:30:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Michele, who didn't believe what he was saying, becoming even more restless. He said that now they needed to launch some truly creative products, not just ordinary ones. He said this to Stefano in the end. I heard, \"Your wife is indispensable, you have to ask her to come.\"\n[1961-06-15T20:31:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Piazza Martiri | I saw Stefano speak in an unexpectedly firm tone. I heard, \"My wife has been busy all day in Capodimonte. She's going to rest at home tonight. She has to take care of me.\"\n[1961-06-15T20:32:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Michele make an ugly face, which for a few seconds ruined his good-looking face, he said. I heard, \"Well, then, see if she can spare some time and take care of us too.\"\n[1961-06-15T21:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I knew that everyone was in a bad mood that night when they left, especially Pinochiazza and Giggia. For different reasons, both of them were extremely angry. They couldn't stand how Michele valued Lina so much, and over the next few days, this irritation gradually turned into a bad mood. They even started arguing over the smallest things.\n[1961-07-15T15:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | One afternoon, during a routine conflict, Giggia slapped Pinocchia. Pinocchia complained about it to Rino. I know that things eventually escalated, I think it was in March, there was an accident, but I don't remember the details.\n[1961-07-15T15:30:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Rino act like a boss as he entered the store, harshly reprimanding Giyaola. Giyaola reacted very strongly, and Rino became even more exaggerated, threatening to fire her. I thought of Rino, who must have been feeling full of himself and full of confidence during that period.\n[1961-07-15T15:35:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | \"I heard him say to Giggia, 'Starting tomorrow, you go back and continue stuffing cream into the pastries.'\"\n[1961-07-15T16:00:00] Martiri Square | I saw that after a while, Michele appeared, smiling as he pulled Rino out of the shop and into the square, letting him take a look at the store's sign. \"I heard 'My friend,' he said, 'this shop is called Solara. You have no right to come into my shop and tell my girlfriend: I'm going to fire you.'\"\n[1961-07-15T16:05:00] Elena's shoe store at Martiri Square | I saw Rino remind him that everything in the store belonged to his brother-in-law, and the shoes were made by his own hands, so he had equal say in the matter. At that moment, Giggia and Pina felt they had their boyfriends to back them up, and they started shouting at each other.\n[1961-07-15T16:10:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw two young men rush back into the shop, trying to get them to quiet down, but it was impossible. Michele gradually lost patience and started shouting that he would fire both of them.\n[1961-07-15T16:11:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that, and not only that, he also said he wanted Lina to manage the shoe store. I thought of Lina? Managing this shop? The two girls fell silent at once, and even Rino was stunned by the idea.\n[1961-07-15T16:15:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw them start discussing this shocking idea. Giyao, Pinocchia, and Rino joined forces against Michele. I heard, \"What does it have to do with her? What use is Lina to you? We've made a lot of money; you shouldn't have anything to complain about. The shoes are all my work. She was just a girl back then; what could she have designed?\"\n[1961-07-15T16:20:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that suddenly, the board— the one with the black strips, color blocks, and photos— let out a dull sound and then suddenly caught fire, the flames rising high. I saw it like a patient struggling to breathe.\n[1961-07-15T16:21:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that when the fire started, Pinocchia was facing away from the photo. The flames came up behind her, as if possessed, crackling and burning the ends of her hair.\n[1961-07-15T16:22:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw Rino act quickly and put out the fire for her. I thought that if it weren't for him, her entire head of hair would have been burned off.\n[1961-07-16T10:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I knew Rino and Michele both believed the fire was caused by Giggia, because sometimes she smoked secretly and had a small lighter. I thought, following Rino's words, that Geyao La had done it on purpose: everyone was busy arguing, and she set the painting board on fire. The board was covered with paper, glue, and paint, and it caught fire immediately.\n[1961-07-16T11:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I need to be careful with Michele: everyone knows Giullara keeps playing with her little lighter, and maybe when they were arguing fiercely, she accidentally set the painting board on fire.\n[1961-07-16T12:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Piazza Martiri | I saw it, but no matter which version you took, Giullara couldn't stand it. She spoke in a provocative tone, saying it was Lina's own fault, that the shattered photo had been set on fire by herself. I heard the words: \"It's like the devil, in order to tempt a saint into sin, takes on the form of a woman to seduce them. And when those saints call upon God, the devil transforms into fire.\"\n[1961-07-16T12:05:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw that, in order to confirm her statement, she also said that Pinocchia had said her sister-in-law had the ability to prevent herself from [being pregnant], and if she failed, she also had the ability to refuse God's gift—[causing a miscarriage].\n[1961-07-20T15:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw Michele start to frequently visit the new Mergellina's Capodimonte, and the rumors grew more intense. He usually stayed there for a long time, always joking around with Lina and Pinocchia.\n[1961-07-20T15:10:00] New Capodimonte | I thought that Pinocchia believed Michele had come to see her, and she was worried someone might tell Enzo, who was currently serving in Piedmont, but at the same time she felt proud, and grew even more flirtatious.\n[1961-07-20T15:20:00] New Capodimonte | I saw Lina constantly making fun of Michele, and she had also heard the rumors about Michele's girlfriend. I heard, \"You'd better not stay here, we're all witches, and we're dangerous.\"\n[1961-07-25T16:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw it, but during that time, whenever I went to see Lina, I never saw her happy. Every time, she would talk about everything with a fake tone, with sarcastic remarks and [intimate gestures].\n[1961-07-25T16:05:00] New Capodimonte | I heard about Xiao Xi Michele? He likes to hurt people? she said. Not at all! If he touched me, I'd catch fire. I was always the one who hurts people. I saw a blue mark on her arm, the result of Stefano's passionate touch. Her eyes were red and swollen, but not from sadness—they were tears of joy.\n[1961-08-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I thought that, in the end, everyone agreed. Giggia was completely convinced: Lina was a witch, she had enchanted her boyfriend, which was why he had sent her to run the store in Piazza Martiri.\n[1961-08-01T11:00:00] Elena's Shoe Store at Martiri Square | I saw her determined to talk to Pinocchia, and in the end, they united and began to fight back. I thought about how for several days, when she went to work, she felt both jealous and desperate.\n[1961-08-01T12:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Pinocchia shouting at her brother, yelling at Stefano for being happy even though he was wearing a green hat. She also attacked Rino—the boyfriend—saying he wasn't really the boss, but just Michele's lackey.\n[1961-08-10T20:00:00] Below the bar | I saw that one evening, Stefano and Rino were waiting for Michele under the bar, and they had a brief, careless conversation. I knew the main idea was: stop bothering Lina, you're just wasting her time, she has work to do.\n[1961-08-10T20:05:00] Below the bar | I saw Michele immediately understand the meaning of the words, and he said coldly. I heard, \"What the hell do you want to say?\"  \n\"If you don't understand, it's because you don't want to understand.\"  \n\"No, my friend, it's you who haven't figured out our business needs. If you don't want to understand, then I'll have to find another way.\"\n[1961-08-10T20:06:00] Below the bar | \"I heard 'that means?'\" Stefano asked.  \n\"My wife wasted it in Capodimonte.\"  \n\"What does that mean?\"  \n\"What she can do in the Martiri Square in a month, my sister and Giugliara together couldn't do in a hundred years.\"\n[1961-08-10T20:07:00] Below the bar | \"I heard, 'Speak clearly.'\"  \n\"Lina should make a decision, Strega! She should take on the responsibility, she should design the products, she should start working on the new shoes right away.\"\n[1961-08-10T20:30:00] Below the bar | I watched them discuss it like that, finally untangling the complex web of relationships and reaching an agreement. I knew that Stefano had firmly ruled out the possibility of his wife working at Martiri Square. The new Capodimonte was doing very well, and moving Lina away from there was definitely not a good idea. But he agreed to have Lina design some new shoe models as soon as possible, at least the winter collection.\n[1961-08-10T20:40:00] Below the bar | I saw Michele say it was foolish not to let Lina run the shoe store in the city center. He said that by the end of summer, she had to start designing new shoes, his tone laced with a threat. The conversation ended like that.\n[1961-08-10T20:41:00] Below the bar | \"I insist that the style has to be very unique,\" Michele emphasized. \"You have to stress that to her.\"  \n\"She'll do what she likes, as usual.\"  \n\"If she'd listen to me, I could give her some suggestions,\" Michele said.  \n\"No need for that.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw that not long after the conversation, one day when I came out of school, the weather had already become very hot, and I felt very tired, so I went to find Lina. These are things she told me herself.\n[1961-08-20T14:05:00] Capodimonte | I was relieved to see that there was only her in Capodimonte. She said she couldn't design anything, not even a pair of sandals, or rather, flip-flops. I heard, \"They'll be angry.\"  \n\"What can I do?\"  \n\"It's all money, Lina.\"  \n\"Their money is already more than enough.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:10:00] Capodimonte | I thought she was, as usual, stubborn. That's just how she is—when someone asks her to focus on something, she immediately loses interest. But I soon realized it wasn't a matter of personality, not even because she disliked her husband, Rino, or the Solara brothers, or perhaps because of the political discussions she had with Pasquale and Pinochia. It was something deeper.\n[1961-08-20T14:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw her expression was serious, and she spoke slowly. \"I heard, 'Right now, there's nothing in my mind.'\"\n\"Have you tried it?\"\n\"I've tried. I'm not the same person I was at twelve anymore.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:16:00] Capodimonte | I realized that in her mind, the shoes had only appeared once, and after that, they never came back. The game was over, and she couldn't start it again. She even found the smell of leather repulsive now. The things she used to do had become something she had forgotten.\n[1961-08-20T14:17:00] Capodimonte | I know, and everything has changed. The small workshop where Fernando used to work has undergone a complete transformation; it now contains three workbenches and three machines. I thought her father had somehow gotten smaller, and he no longer argued with his older son at all, just bent over his work.\n[1961-08-20T14:18:00] Capodimonte | I thought that her feelings had gradually grown cold too. Before, when her mother passed by Capodimonte, Lina would still fill her basket with things, giving some gifts to her few younger brothers, as if they were still poor and starving. Now, she no longer felt any connection with Rino. Their relationship had been broken, severed. She no longer felt he needed her help and protection.\n[1961-08-20T14:19:00] Capodimonte | I thought about the motives that had once inspired her imagination, and the soil that had once produced those shoes had now become dry.\n[1961-08-20T14:20:00] Capodimonte | I saw her suddenly say that even if she never went to school again, she could do so many things, as if she were showing it off to me. Finally, she laughed a bit nervously, glanced at me, and tried to see my reaction.\n[1961-08-20T14:21:00] Capodimonte | I thought about how I hadn't answered her, and I was so excited I couldn't speak. Was this what Lina was like? Wouldn't she, like me, bury herself in study? The thoughts that arose in her mind, the designs for shoes, the things she wrote down and said out loud, the very complex plans, the crazy ideas—were they all just to show off to me? She no longer had that motivation, so now she's lost? Even her artistic handling of that wedding photo, she can't do it again now? Everything about her is just a coincidence, the product of chaos?\n[1961-08-20T14:25:00] Capodimonte | I saw, I felt, my tightly coiled heart loosening up. She ran her fingers across her forehead, a gesture she often made. I softened when I saw her sparkling eyes and fragile smile. I thought about it, but this state lasted only a short time.\n[1961-08-20T14:26:00] Capodimonte | I saw her say regretfully. I heard, \"I've always had to prove that I'm the best.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:27:00] Capodimonte | \"I heard him say, 'When this place first opened, Stefano taught me how to cheat on the scale. I told him, 'You're a liar! A thief! That's how you make your money!' But in the end, I couldn't resist the temptation. Not only did I learn his tricks right away, but I even found a better way and showed it to him. My mind is always coming up with new ideas: I've deceived all of you, I cheated on the scale, I played all sorts of tricks, I deceived the whole Mergellina. Don't believe me, Elena! Don't believe what I say or what I do.\" I saw that she was somewhat gloomy, and then I said.\n[1961-08-20T14:28:00] Capodimonte | I felt uncomfortable, and in just a few seconds, I already didn't know what she really wanted. Why was she telling me this now? I didn't understand. Was she saying it on purpose, or had those words just slipped out without her realizing? Was it to strengthen our friendship—that was her real intention—so she had spoken impulsively?",

    "text": "[1961-08-20T14:29:00] Capodimonte | I saw that she quickly denied the feeling, and she felt it was necessary to do so. I heard, \"You see, I'm the same with Stefano as I am with you. I do good and bad things with everyone.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:30:00] Capodimonte | I saw her long fingers interlaced, clenched tightly as she asked me. \"I heard her say, 'You know, Girola said my photo caught fire on its own.'\"  \n\"That's just the nonsense Girola says. She's angry at you.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:31:00] Capodimonte | I saw her smile, which sounded a bit nervous, and then she suddenly changed her mood. I heard her say, \"I feel pain here, something is swollen behind my eyes. Have you seen those knives? They're all very sharp, I just sharpened them. When I cut sausages, I always think: how much blood can a person's body hold? If you put too much in a container, it will crack or produce sparks and then burn down. I'm glad that wedding photo was burned. Burn down this marriage, the shop, the shoes, the Solara brothers—everything should be burned.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:35:00] Capodimonte | I saw that I had made her quiet, and she nodded. I thought to myself that I understood—no matter how she struggled, resisted, or tried to do anything, she could not free herself from that situation. From the day she got married, she had fallen into a misfortune that grew heavier and heavier, suffocating her, and this made me feel painful for her.\n[1961-08-20T14:36:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"You should try to be quiet.\"  \n\"You have to help me.\"  \n\"How can I help you?\"  \n\"You have to be with me.\"  \n\"I am with you.\"  \n\"It's not real. I told you all my secrets, even the worst ones, but you never told me anything.\"  \n\"You're wrong. You're the only one I've ever been open with.\"\n[1961-08-20T14:37:00] Capodimonte | I saw her shaking her head very forcefully, then she said. I heard, \"Even if you're better than me, even if you know more than me, don't leave me, okay?\"\n[1961-09-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her pretend to yield. I know they've been pressuring and tempting her all along.\n[1961-09-01T10:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw her tell Stefano that she would design some new shoes.\n[1961-09-01T11:00:00] Mergellina | When I saw her meeting Michele, I immediately told him about the decision.\n[1961-09-01T12:00:00] Shoe Workshop | I saw it, and then she called Rino, speaking to him just as he had always hoped. I heard, \"You design some new shoes, I can't. You and Dad design them together, you both have the skill, you know what to do.\"\n[1961-09-01T12:01:00] Shoe Workshop | I heard, \"But before you finish making and selling these shoes, don't tell anyone they weren't designed by me—not even Stefano.\"  \n\"What if the shoes don't sell?\"  \n\"That'll be my problem.\"  \n\"What if they do sell well?\"  \n\"Then I'll tell everyone the truth, and you'll get the recognition you deserve.\"\n[1961-09-01T12:05:00] Shoe Workshop | I saw him and Fernando start working together to make new shoes. I thought of how much Rino loved this lie.\n[1961-09-10T15:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw him, but he would sometimes secretly go to Lina and show her the progress of his work. I thought about how she always looked at those shoes with admiration, because she couldn't stand her brother's anxious behavior and wanted him to leave quickly.\n[1961-09-15T15:00:00] Capodimonte | I thought, but soon, those new shoes surprised even her—completely in the same style as shoes on the market now, but with innovations.\n[1961-09-15T15:05:00] Capodimonte | I heard her say one day, in a very cheerful tone, \"Maybe the previous shoes weren't actually my idea at all, but my brother's.\" I thought she felt a sense of relief.\n[1961-09-15T15:10:00] Capodimonte | I thought about how she had once again developed feelings for her brother, or more accurately, how she realized she had previously exaggerated things: that relationship could never be untangled, could never be changed, no matter what her brother did, even if a mouse came out of his body, or a horse with mental health issues, or some other animal—this relationship would never change.\n[1961-09-15T15:15:00] Capodimonte | I thought about what she had guessed—that it was the lie that made Rino no longer feel uncreative and incapable, which brought him back to his teenage years, and now he had discovered that he truly had a skill, that he was actually very capable.\n[1961-09-15T15:20:00] Capodimonte | After each consultation with my sister, he would beg her in her ear to give him the keys to her house. I thought of my sister's praise, and he became increasingly happy.\n[1961-09-15T15:30:00] Lina's house | I know he and Pinocchio would always sneak off there for an hour.\n[1961-10-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I told her that I would always be her friend. On Sundays, I often invited her to go out with me.\n[1961-10-15T16:00:00] Overseas Exhibition | I remember once, we even went to see the \"Overseas Exhibition\" with two of my female classmates.\n[1961-10-15T16:10:00] Overseas Exhibition | When I saw them, my two classmates immediately became shy once they found out that Lina had been married for more than a year. They acted as if they had to come out with my mother, and they both seemed respectful and rather stiff.\n[1961-10-15T16:15:00] Overseas Exhibition | I saw Lina shaking her head. I heard one of the girls ask Lina, \"Do you have a child?\"\n[1961-10-15T16:16:00] Overseas Exhibition | I saw Lina shake her head again. I heard, \"Can't get pregnant?\"\n[1961-10-15T16:30:00] Overseas Exhibition | I thought, by this time, the event that night had basically ended in failure.\n[1962-05-15T18:00:00] Cultural Circle | I saw that in mid-May, I pulled her into a cultural circle, recommended by Teacher Galiani. I thought I needed to go and listen, it was a lecture by a scientist named Giuseppe Montalenti.\n[1962-05-15T18:10:00] Cultural Circle | I knew this was my first time attending an event like this. Montalenti's lecture was similar to his classes, but the audience wasn't students—they were adults who had specifically come to hear him speak.\n[1962-05-15T18:20:00] Cultural Circle | I saw us sitting in a bare room, at the back listening to him speak. I thought about it, but I soon found it very annoying. Teacher Galiani asked me to come listen, but she never showed up.\n[1962-05-15T18:30:00] Cultural Circle | I saw myself quietly saying to Lina. I heard, \"Let's go.\"\n[1962-05-15T18:31:00] Cultural Circle | I heard, but she didn't want to leave. She whispered to me that she didn't have the courage to stand up, afraid of disturbing the lecture. It was almost uncharacteristic of her to feel such worry—an interest she didn't want to admit, or perhaps a sense of unease.\n[1962-05-15T19:00:00] Cultural Circle | I saw that we stayed until the end. I knew that Montalieri had mentioned Darwin, but neither of us knew who Darwin was.\n[1962-05-15T19:10:00] Outside the Cultural Circle | I said to her when I left the lecture. I heard him say, \"He said something I already knew: you're a monkey.\"\n[1962-05-15T19:11:00] Outside the Cultural Circle | I heard her, but she wasn't joking. \"I never want to forget,\" she said.  \n\"Never want to forget that you're a monkey?\"  \n\"We're all animals.\"  \n\"You and me?\"  \n\"Everyone of us.\"\n[1962-05-15T19:12:00] Outside the Cultural Circle | \"I heard him say, 'But he said we're very different from monkeys.'\"\n\"Is that so? What's the difference? Is it because my mother pierced my ears and I've been wearing earrings since birth, while monkey mothers don't pierce their babies' ears, so they don't wear earrings?\"\n[1962-05-15T19:15:00] Outside the Cultural Circle | At that moment, we started laughing and listed the differences between humans and monkeys, one after another, getting more and more absurd, and we had a really great conversation.\n[1962-05-15T20:00:00] Mergellina | When we returned to Mergellina, we met Pasquale and Pinocchia, who were walking along the main road. From them, we learned that Stefano was looking everywhere for Lina; he was very worried.\n[1962-05-15T20:05:00] Mergellina | I saw our good mood vanish in an instant. I told her I would accompany her home, but she refused.\n[1962-05-15T20:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that later she accepted Pasquale and Pinochia's offer, and they drove her back.\n[1962-05-16T10:00:00] Mergellina | I found out the next day why Stefano had gone to see her. It wasn't because we had stayed out too late, nor was it because his wife spent more of her free time with me. The real reason was that he had just learned that Rino and Pinocchia often met at his house, embracing on his bed, and the key had been given to them by Lina! Also, Pinocchia had given birth.\n[1962-05-16T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know that what really angered him was when he found out about his sister's disgraceful affair with Rino, and after he slapped his sister, Pinocchia shouted at him: \"You're jealous of me because I'm a real woman, Lina isn't! Rino knows how to handle women, but you don't.\"\n[1962-05-16T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Stefano so excited, and Lina suddenly remembered how composed and proper he had been when they got engaged, and she burst into laughter.\n[1962-05-16T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw Stefano drive off to calm himself down, so he wouldn't kill her in a fit of rage. I thought Lina must have gone out to find a prostitute.\n[1962-05-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that Pinochya's wedding to Rino was arranged very hastily. I thought I hadn't paid much attention to it—I had a lot of homework to do and many class questions to prepare for.",

    "text": "[1962-05-25T10:00:00] School | I saw that Teacher Galiani always managed to break the teachers' code of conduct with complete ease. She invited me—only me, the only one in the entire high school—to her house for a party she was hosting for a few children. I was thinking of another thing that happened, which left me in a very excited and restless state.\n[1962-05-25T10:05:00] School | I thought about how she had lent me her books and newspapers, encouraging me to join that world peace march, and how she had given me access to such profound lectures—it was no longer a very ordinary thing.\n[1962-05-25T10:10:00] School | I saw that her audacity had grown even greater. She pulled me aside and issued me an invitation. I heard her say, \"You can come whenever you want.\" She said that, \"You can come by yourself, or with your boyfriend or another friend, it doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you come.\"\n[1962-05-25T10:15:00] School | I thought like that, and on the last few days of this term, she said these words to me, without considering how much I still had to learn, or the storm these words had stirred up inside me.\n[1962-05-25T10:20:00] School | I saw that I immediately agreed to her request, but I immediately realized I had no courage to go to her house. I couldn't even imagine attending a gathering at any teacher's house, let alone at Professor Galiani's. For me, that would be like going to the palace to pay homage to the queen and dancing with the princes.\n[1962-05-25T10:25:00] School | I thought it was a very pleasant thing, but at the same time it was very shocking, like being suddenly pushed, like someone grabbing my arm and forcing me to do something, even though that thing was very attractive to me, I knew it wasn't right for me.\n[1962-05-25T10:30:00] School | I thought you knew that if it was possible, you would politely decline. Teacher Galiani never even considered that I didn't have suitable clothes to wear.\n[1962-05-25T10:35:00] School | I know that when I was in school, I always wore a very cheap black shirt. I thought, what else could the teacher possibly expect under the shirt? Something like the underwear and pants she was wearing? The shirt was immodest underneath, and below it was poverty and rudeness.\n[1962-05-25T10:40:00] Posillipo | I know I only have a pair of very old shoes, and the only good outfit I have is the one I wore to Lina's wedding. I thought about it, but the weather was already very hot. That dress would have been okay to wear in March, but it would have looked strange to wear it at the end of May.\n[1962-05-25T10:45:00] Posillipo | I thought that, no matter what, the issue wasn't just about what I wore. I felt isolated and embarrassed among those young people I didn't know, because I didn't understand their tastes, and wasn't familiar with the way they talked or joked.\n[1962-05-26T10:00:00] School | I thought of asking Alfonso Carracci if he'd like to go with me, since he'd always been very kind to me. But Alfonso Carracci was my classmate, and Professor Galiani had only invited me.\n[1962-05-28T15:00:00] Capodimonte | For several days, I was very anxious. I wanted to talk to the teacher, making up any excuse to get out of it. Finally, I decided to ask Lina's opinion.\n[1962-05-28T15:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw a yellow bruise under one of her cheeks. I knew it was also a very bad moment for her. I thought about how she reacted very coldly to the news.\n[1962-05-28T15:11:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"Where are you going?\"  \n\"The teacher invited me.\"  \n\"Where does this teacher live?\"  \n\"On Vittorio Emanuele Street.\"  \n\"Can you see the sea from her house?\"  \n\"I don't know.\"\n[1962-05-28T15:12:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"What does her husband do?\"  \n\"He's a doctor at Cotugno Hospital.\"  \n\"Are her children in school?\"  \n\"I don't know.\"\n[1962-05-28T15:13:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"Do you want me to lend you a piece of clothing?\"  \n\"You know, I can't wear your clothes.\"  \n\"You just have a bigger chest than me.\"  \n\"I'm bigger than you everywhere, Lina.\"\n[1962-05-28T15:14:00] Capodimonte | I saw that she was happy with my decision. \"I don't know what to say to you anymore.\"  \n\"Then I won't go?\"  \n\"Better not to.\"  \n\"Okay, I won't go.\"\n[1962-05-28T15:20:00] Poinciana Road | I saw myself saying goodbye to her, exiting from Capodimonte, and walking down a path lined with oleanders. At that moment, I heard her call my name, and I turned back.\n[1962-05-28T15:21:00] Poinciana Road | I heard her say, \"I'll go with you.\"  \n\"Where to?\"  \n\"To the party.\"  \n\"Stefano won't let you go.\"  \n\"Let's talk about that later. Just tell me if you're willing to take me.\"  \n\"Of course I am.\"\n[1962-05-28T15:22:00] Poinciana Road | I saw her become very happy, and I didn't dare to let her change her mind.\n[1962-05-28T15:40:00] On the way home | I thought about how, on the way home, I had already sensed my situation worsening further. The obstacles I faced in attending that party hadn't disappeared, and Lina's offer to go instead only made things more complicated.\n[1962-05-28T15:45:00] On the way home | I thought of the reasons, but they were messy and vague. I didn't want to list them out; even if I did, there would be many contradictions. I was worried that Stefano wouldn't let her go, but I was also afraid that Stefano would let her go.\n[1962-05-28T15:50:00] On the way home | I thought about how I was afraid she would dress in a way that drew attention when she went, just like the time she went to see the Solara brothers. I also worried that no matter what she wore, her beauty would shine like stars, and everyone would be captivated by her.\n[1962-05-28T15:55:00] On the way home | I worried that she might speak in a dialect, say something inappropriate, and reveal her limited education, having only finished elementary school. I was afraid that if she started talking, everyone would be shocked by her intelligence, and Teacher Galiani would be captivated by her.\n[1962-05-28T16:00:00] On the way home | I thought about how I was worried that the teacher might find her both arrogant and childish, and she might say to me: \"This friend of yours, you shouldn't see her anymore.\" I was afraid that the teacher would realize I was nothing more than a dull shadow of Lina, that she would no longer care about me and would instead focus on her, want to see her again, and bring her back to school to continue her studies.\n[1962-05-30T10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that for several days, I avoided going to Capodimonte. I hoped that Lina had already forgotten about the party, and when the day of the gathering arrived, I would sneak off by myself and later tell her: I didn't hear from you after that.\n[1962-06-02T15:00:00] Posillipo | I saw her, but she came to find me quickly—she hadn't sought me out in a long time. She said she had convinced Stefano, who would not only take us there but also come to pick us up. She wanted to know what time we would arrive at the teacher's house. I asked anxiously, \"What are you wearing?\"  \n\"You wear whatever you want, and I'll wear the same,\" she said.  \n\"I'll wear a shirt and a skirt.\"  \n\"Then I'll wear the same too.\"\n[1962-06-02T15:05:00] Posillipo | I saw her make a pleasant expression and she said she had learned how to control him. \"I heard 'Stefano will definitely pick us up?'\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"How did you convince him?\"\n\"If I want something,\" she whispered, as if she didn't even want to hear herself say it, \"all I have to do is act like a prostitute.\"\n[1962-06-02T15:06:00] Posillipo | I know that's exactly how she said it, in the local dialect, and she added other self-deprecating remarks that made me understand how repulsive her husband was, and how repulsive she made herself. I felt even more uneasy. I thought I should tell her I didn't want to go to the party, I should tell her I had changed my mind.\n[1962-06-02T15:07:00] Posillipo | I knew, of course, that Lina appeared very proper on the surface, working from morning till night, but she had another wild, unpredictable side, especially now that I was responsible for introducing her to the Galiani family. This wild side of Lina frightened me, and I felt that her disobedience would only make her behavior worse.\n[1962-06-02T15:08:00] Posillipo | I wondered what would happen if something were to trigger her in front of the teacher. What would happen if she spoke to me in the same tone she had just used with me?\n[1962-06-02T15:09:00] Posillipo | I said very carefully, \"Lina, please, don't talk like that when the time comes.\" She looked at me nervously. I heard, \"How to speak?\"  \n\"Like this.\"  \nShe paused, then asked me, \"Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?\"  \n\"How could I be embarrassed by you?\" I said very confidently. I thought about how I had hidden my worries, because I still feared she might do something embarrassing.\n[1962-06-05T19:00:00] In Stefano's car | I saw Stefano driving the convertible and he gave us a ride all the way to the building where the teacher lived. I sat in the back, while the two of them sat in front. I saw the solid gold wedding rings on their hands for the first time, and I felt deeply moved.\n[1962-06-05T19:05:00] In Stefano's car | I saw Lina just as she had said—she was wearing a shirt and a skirt, nothing exaggerated at all. She wasn't wearing any makeup, just a little lipstick.\n[1962-06-05T19:06:00] The car of Stefano | I saw Stefano in his festive suit, covered in lots of gold jewelry, and he smelled strongly of aftershave. I thought it was as if we were waiting until the last moment to say to him: \"You come too!\" But we didn't say anything.\n[1962-06-05T19:10:00] At the teacher's building downstairs | I just thanked him warmly, and Lina got out of the car without saying goodbye to him. I saw Stefano driving away, the tires letting out a painful screech.",

    "text": "[1962-06-05T19:15:00] Teacher's house stairs | I saw that we had originally planned to take the elevator, but we didn't succeed. We had never taken an elevator before, and there wasn't one in Lina's new apartment building either. We were worried about getting into trouble, so we decided to go up the stairs instead.\n[1962-06-05T19:20:00] At the teacher's doorstep | I saw Teacher Galiani telling me that her apartment was on the fifth floor, with a sign on the door that read \"Dr. Frigerio, Professor.\" I walked ahead, and Lina followed behind me. We didn't speak, and we carefully examined each floor's door numbers as we went. I saw that the entire building was very clean, and the door handles and brass name plates gleamed brightly. I thought my heart was beating quickly.\n[1962-06-05T19:25:00] At the teacher's front door | I saw the door number we were looking for before we even heard the loud music and people talking.\n[1962-06-05T19:26:00] At the teacher's front door | I adjusted my skirt because the petticoat always stuck to my legs, so I pulled it down a bit. Lina fixed her hair with her fingertips. I thought it was obvious that both of us were worried we might accidentally show weakness, revealing the side of ourselves we didn't want to display.\n[1962-06-05T19:27:00] At the teacher's doorstep | I saw myself pressing the doorbell, waiting a moment, but no one came to open the door. I looked at Lina and pressed the doorbell again, this time waiting longer.\n[1962-06-05T19:28:00] At the teacher's front door | I heard hurried footsteps coming from inside the house, the door opened, and a short, dark-haired young man appeared in the doorway. I saw his face was very handsome, his eyes bright and full of life. The moment I looked at him, I thought he was about twenty years old.\n[1962-06-05T19:29:00] At the teacher's front door | I said excitedly that I was a student of Professor Galiani, but before I could finish, he smiled. I heard, \"You're Elena?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Everyone in our family knows you because Mother often read your essays to us, motivating us.\"\n[1962-06-05T19:30:00] At the teacher's doorstep | I know this young man is named Nadezhda. I thought of his words, which had been encouraging, and suddenly I felt very strong. To this day, I still remember the way he stood at the door, very friendly.\n[1962-06-05T19:31:00] At the teacher's front door | I thought this was the first time in my life I had such an experience—entering an unfamiliar environment, one that made me feel extremely uncomfortable, yet finding myself already well-known and famous there. Without having to do anything, I was accepted by everyone. They already knew my name, knew about me.\n[1962-06-05T19:32:00] At the teacher's front door | I thought about others, those strangers who had to struggle to understand you in order to enter your world, while you could effortlessly enter theirs. I had grown accustomed to adversity, and this sudden stroke of good fortune made me feel energized. I immediately felt at ease. I was no longer anxious, no longer worried about what Lina might or might not do.\n[1962-06-05T19:33:00] At the teacher's house | I was so surprised by this unexpected attention that I even forgot to introduce my friend to Nadia. He didn't seem to notice Lina's presence either, and I felt as if I had come alone. He invited me into the house and kept talking about how his mother spoke of me, how she praised me. I followed him into the house, politely dismissing his excessive compliments, while Lina closed the door behind me.\n[1962-06-05T19:35:00] At the teacher's house | I saw the house was large, all the doors of the rooms were open, brightly lit, with very high ceilings adorned with floral murals.\n[1962-06-05T19:36:00] At the teacher's house | I saw books everywhere in the house, shelves reaching from the floor to the ceiling along the entire wall; their collection of books was more than the ones in our Mergellina library. The thing that shocked me the most was that there were books everywhere in the house.\n[1962-06-05T19:37:00] At the teacher's house | I saw that there was still music, in a hall with colorful lights, some boys and girls were dancing, while other young people smoked and chatted. Everyone seemed to come from an educated family, like Nadezhda—her mother was a high school teacher, her father a surgeon. Her father wasn't there that night.\n[1962-06-05T19:40:00] Teacher's Balcony | I saw Nadia lead us to a small balcony. I saw that it was warm outside, with a wide open view. The air was filled with the fragrance of wisteria and roses, as well as the smell of absinthe and almond pastries. We saw the entire city glowing with lights, while the sea beyond was completely dark.\n[1962-06-05T19:45:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw the teacher calling my name with great joy, she was the one who reminded me that Lina was standing behind me. \"I heard 'Is this your friend?'\"\nI mumbled incoherently, realizing I didn't know how to introduce her: \"Yes, teacher. Her name is Lina. We went to elementary school together,\" I said.\n[1962-06-05T19:46:00] Teacher's Balcony | I saw Teacher Galiani politely praising our long-standing friendship, saying that this friendship was very important, a feeling we could trust and rely on. She said this while staring at Lina, who could only utter single-syllable words. She realized the teacher's gaze had fallen on her wedding ring, and immediately covered it with her other hand. I heard, \"You're married?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Are you the same age as Elena?\"\n\"I'm two weeks older than her.\"\n[1962-06-05T19:47:00] Teacher's Balcony | I heard Teacher Galiani look around and say to her son, \"Have you introduced Nadia to them yet?\"  \n\"No not yet.\"  \n\"What are you waiting for?\"  \n\"Take it slow, mom, they just arrived.\"\n[1962-06-05T19:48:00] Teacher's Balcony | I heard the teacher say to me, \"Nadia really wants to meet you. My son is a scoundrel, don't believe him, but Nadia loves studying, you two will surely become good friends, you'll like her.\"\n[1962-06-05T19:50:00] Teacher's Balcony | I saw that we had left the teacher alone on the balcony, smoking. I knew, Nadia was the youngest of Nadia's sisters. I heard Nadia describe her like this, making a face of disdain: \"Sixteen years of trouble, she ruined my childhood.\" I joked that my own younger brothers were the same, all very troublesome.\n[1962-06-05T19:51:00] Teacher's Balcony | I looked at Lina with a smile, hoping for her response. I saw her, but she was serious and said nothing.\n[1962-06-05T20:00:00] Dance hall | I saw that we had returned again to the dancing room. I saw that the lights were dim, and a song by Paul Anka was playing, or maybe \"Beautiful Sky\" by Jimmy Fontana. The people dancing held each other close, their shadows swaying under the dim light.\n[1962-06-05T20:05:00] Dance Hall | I saw that the music had ended, and someone reluctantly turned on the lights. Before the room became bright, I recognized Nino, who was lighting a cigarette, the flame illuminating his face. I thought, I felt a sudden jolt in my heart.\n[1962-06-05T20:06:00] Dance Hall | I know I haven't seen him in a year. I thought he looked older, taller, his hair messier, but also more handsome.\n[1962-06-05T20:07:00] Dance hall | I saw the electric light in the room turn on, and I also recognized the girl who had danced with him just now—she was the elegant and pure young girl I had seen outside the school before. I thought about her existence, which forced me to acknowledge my own dullness.\n[1962-06-05T20:08:00] Dance Hall | I heard Nadia say, \"This is her.\" I know Nadia—the daughter of Professor Galiani is her.\n[1962-06-05T20:10:00] Dance hall | I thought that although it was strange, this fact didn't spoil the pleasure the party had given me. I was glad I had been in that house, among those wealthy people. I loved Nino, there was no doubt about that, I had never doubted it.\n[1962-06-05T20:11:00] Dance hall | I thought, of course, that in the face of the situation at that time, I should have been very painful, because it once again proved that I would never get him, but I wasn't really sad: he had a girlfriend, and in every way, his girlfriend was better than me, and I knew that.",

I immediately realized that nothing about this situation pained me; instead, this reality brought me a strange sense of comfort. I felt that they had chosen each other in the most proper and natural way. In short, I seemed to suddenly see a pair of extremely perfect and well-matched partners, ones that only deserved admiration, not judgment.\n[1962-06-05T20:15:00] Dance hall | I saw Nadia introduce me to her sister: \"Nadia, this is Elena, a student of Mom's.\" The girl heard this and immediately rushed over to embrace me. I heard a low voice say, \"Elena, it's a pleasure to meet you!\"\n[1962-06-05T20:16:00] Dance Hall | I heard her speak in my favor before I even had a chance to say anything, and it wasn't the joking tone her brother used. She said she really liked my writing and also loved my writing style. I thought of how her excited tone was exactly the same as her mother's excitement when she read my essay in class.\n[1962-06-05T20:17:00] Dance hall | I thought about the scene at the time, and it felt meaningful because the people I cared about most were there—Nino and Lila. They were both present, and they could see how much I was appreciated and loved in that home.\n[1962-06-05T20:20:00] Dance Hall | I saw that I was acting very friendly and easygoing, a side of myself I had never noticed before. I immediately started chatting with them effortlessly. I spoke to them in a refined Italian. I didn't notice anything unnatural about it at all—that was the language I used at school.\n[1962-06-05T20:25:00] Dance hall | I asked Nino about his trip to England, asked Nadia what book she was reading, and what music she was listening to.\n[1962-06-05T20:30:00] Dance hall | I saw myself dancing with Nadezhda sometimes, and with other boys sometimes, never stopping. I even felt I could dance rock 'n' roll. When I danced rock 'n' roll, my glasses slid down my nose, but fortunately they didn't break. I thought it was a very beautiful night.\n[1962-06-05T20:45:00] Dance hall | I saw that later, Nino spoke to Lina for a few minutes and asked her to dance, but she refused. She left the dance hall, and I couldn't see her anymore.\n[1962-06-05T21:00:00] Dance hall | I had been there for a long time before I remembered my friend. I danced for a long time first, then talked with Nadezhda, Nino, and several others my age. Finally, I went to the balcony with Nadezhda because it was hot inside, and they wanted Teacher Galiani to join our conversation too. At that moment, she was alone on the balcony, smoking and breathing in the fresh air. I heard \"Come on.\" Nadia said, pulling my hand.  \nI replied, \"I'll go get my friend.\"\n[1962-06-05T21:05:00] In front of the bookshelf | I saw it and then pulled away from his hand. I felt all over hot, I searched the whole room for Lina, and finally found her in front of a wall covered entirely with books.\n[1962-06-05T21:06:00] In front of the bookshelf | \"I heard 'Come on, let's go to the balcony.' I said.\"  \n\"What do you want to do on the balcony?\"  \n\"To cool off, have a chat.\"  \n\"You go by yourself.\"  \n\"Are you getting bored?\"  \n\"No, I'm reading.\"  \n\"Did you see it? There are too many books here.\"  \n\"Yes.\"\n[1962-06-05T21:07:00] In front of the bookshelf | I thought she was unhappy. Maybe because she'd been ignored all evening, or maybe because of the wedding ring on her ring finger, or perhaps because no one here praised her beauty—Nadia's beauty was the most favored here.\n[1962-06-05T21:08:00] In front of the bookshelf | I thought, or maybe because even though she already had a husband, had given birth once, and had even had an abortion, even though she designed shoes and earned money, in this house she didn't know who she was; she couldn't stand out like she did in our Mergellina.\n[1962-06-05T21:09:00] In front of the bookshelf | I thought like that, and suddenly I remembered the feeling of unease and alienation I had on the day Lina got married. I felt comfortable with these people, more so than with the young people in our Mergellina. The only thing that made me feel uneasy now was that Lina was out of place, as if she had been pushed to the margins.\n[1962-06-05T21:10:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw myself pulling her away from the bookshelf and into the balcony.\n[1962-06-05T21:15:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw others still dancing, forming a small circle around Professor Galiani, with three or four boys and two girls. But only the boys were talking; the only woman who inserted a sarcastic comment was Professor Galiani herself.\n[1962-06-05T21:16:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw that I immediately realized, several older boys—Nino, Nadia, and a boy named Carlo—thought it was inappropriate to argue with the teacher, so they argued among themselves, treating her just as a final judge to decide the winner.\n[1962-06-05T21:17:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw Nadia and her mother clashing head-on, but in reality, they were both targeting Nino. Carlo supported the teacher's point of view, but to convince the other two, he had to express his own thoughts, and they had to differ from what the teacher said. Nino politely stated that he didn't agree with Professor Galiani's viewpoint; his opinion was completely opposite to that of Nadia and Carlo.\n[1962-06-05T21:20:00] Teacher's Balcony | I thought about how I would be completely absorbed in listening to their conversation. What they said would either bloom in my mind, because they were topics I was familiar with, and then I would become lively and fully engaged; or they would be like unfamiliar terrain, and I would step back, hiding my ignorance.\n[1962-06-05T21:21:00] Teacher's balcony | I found the second scenario deeply unsettling: sometimes I didn't know what they were talking about, I couldn't understand. To me, it all sounded meaningless, yet they showed me an entirely new world filled with people, events, and thoughts—a boundless world.\n[1962-06-05T21:22:00] Teacher's balcony | I realized that the reading I did at night was nowhere near enough, and I needed to work even harder to say to Nino, Teacher Galiani, Carlo, and Nadia: Yes, I understand, I know.\n[1962-06-05T21:25:00] Teacher's balcony | I heard her say, \"If this continues, a Marxist-Leninist party will turn into a social democratic one. Have you seen Leone's performance at the opening of the new term?\" Nadia shook her head and said with some contempt, \"You can't change the world through planning; it requires blood, it requires violence.\" Nino calmly replied to him, \"Planning is an essential tool.\"\n[1962-06-05T21:30:00] Teacher's Balcony | I saw them talking very passionately; Teacher Galiani was paying close attention to what the boys were saying. Later, Nino mentioned America in an admiring tone, speaking a few words of English as if he were British. I thought about how much they knew, as if they understood everything about this world.\n[1962-06-05T21:31:00] The teacher's balcony | I thought about how, in just a short year, his voice had become stronger, deeper, even a bit raspy, no longer as harsh as it was at Lina's wedding or when he was at school.\n[1962-06-05T21:32:00] Teacher's balcony | I heard him mention Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, as if he had been there himself. He also mentioned Danilo Dolci, Martin Luther King, and Bertrand Russell, and spoke about an organization he agreed with—\"The World Peace Tour\"—refuting Nadezhda's point of view, since she had used a sarcastic tone when mentioning the organization just before.\n[1962-06-05T21:35:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw, and then their tone became more intense, their voices rose. He said, technically speaking, this world has the ability to eliminate colonialism, hunger, and war from Earth. I thought, he's really handsome!\n[1962-06-05T21:36:00] Teacher's balcony | I was so excited I felt like I was going to burst, even though I knew nothing about the thousands of things they were talking about—the Gaullism, the pension funds, the Social Democratic Party, the left's openness, D'Orso, Bertrand Russell, the \"Black Feet\" immigrants, who the Fanfaniists were, what had happened in Beirut, Lebanon, and what was happening in Algeria. I felt an urgent need, one I'd always had, which was to care for, protect, support, and look after Nino no matter what he was doing.\n[1962-06-05T21:37:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw her standing next to Nino, radiant like a fairy. I thought that was the only moment during the entire evening when I felt jealous of Nadezhda.\n[1962-06-05T21:38:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw and then I heard myself saying something, as if it wasn't me speaking, but another person who knew more and was more confident, deciding to speak through my mouth. I started talking without knowing what I was going to say, and as I listened to their discussion, I kept recalling the words I had seen in Professor Galiani's newspaper. My desire to express myself and prove myself overpowered my shyness.\n[1962-06-05T21:39:00] The teacher's balcony | I saw that I was using the Italian I employed when translating Greek and Latin, and I supported Nino's point of view. I heard myself say that I didn't want to live in a world full of war, that we shouldn't repeat the mistakes of the previous generation. If war breaks out now, it will be a war against nuclear weapon factories. If we allow the use of those weapons, we'll be worse than the Nazis.\n[1962-06-05T21:40:00] The teacher's balcony | I said at the end that the world has too many tyrants and suffering people, and change is desperately needed, but it must be achieved through peaceful means. I was thinking, and when I talk about these things, I get very excited. I feel tears welling up in my eyes.\n[1962-06-05T21:42:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw Nadia looking not very happy, and another girl with blonde hair, whose name I didn't know, was staring at me with a mocking smile on her face. I thought about whether the words I had said were accepted by everyone.\n[1962-06-05T21:43:00] The teacher's balcony | I saw it, but by the time I spoke, Nino was already nodding. After I finished, Teacher Galiani immediately expressed her own thoughts, and she mentioned something I had said twice. She said, \"Just like Elena just said.\"\n[1962-06-05T21:44:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw Nadia also supported me; she left Nino and came over to whisper in my ear. I heard, \"You're really great, so brave!\"\n[1962-06-05T21:45:00] Teacher's balcony | I saw Lina beside me at that moment, and she didn't say anything. But as the teacher was speaking, she pulled me slightly and whispered in the dialect. \"I'm so tired, ask where the phone is, I need to call Stefano.\"",

    "text": "[1962-06-05T22:00:00] In Stefano's car | I saw her start talking as soon as she got into the car, even though her husband, in a low mood, had just asked us if we were having a good time. I knew, but in the car, when we returned to Mergellina, she didn't mention that feeling at all. She just became moody and mean. I thought to myself that I hadn't spoken, feeling a bit dizzy, because my nerves had been tightly stretched all night, full of excitement and happiness.\n[1962-06-05T22:05:00] Stefano's car | I saw her touch Stefano's hand, which was resting on the gear shift. I heard her speak in the local dialect, saying she'd never been so disgusted in her whole life. \"We should have just gone to the cinema back then,\" she told her husband, expressing her regret. I thought she was deliberately trying to hurt me, to remind me: Look, no matter what, I still have a man. Look at you, you have nothing, you're still a virgin. You know all kinds of knowledge, but you don't know how things really are.\n[1962-06-05T22:10:00] In Stefano's car | I heard her say that even watching TV all night was better than spending an evening with those terrible people. In that house, nothing—no piece of furniture, no painting—had been bought with their own money; all the furniture was from a hundred years ago. I knew the house had been built at least three hundred years ago. Some of their books were indeed new, but many were very old, covered in thick dust, as if no one had touched them for decades. They were books on law, history, science, and politics.\n[1962-06-05T22:15:00] In Stefano's car | I heard her [intimate gesture] against her husband's neck, then she ran her fingertips through his hair. \"Stefano! If you were here, you'd hear them chattering like parrots, repeating each other's words without understanding a thing they're saying.\" I knew that in that house, they studied and learned. My great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, generation after generation, had been lawyers, doctors, and professors for at least a hundred years. So they all spoke that way, dressed that way, ate that way, and walked that way.\n[1962-06-05T22:20:00] Stefano's car | I heard him say, \"Do you know what the pension fund is? Do you know what it means to be a liberal open-minded person? Elena, next time don't take me with you. If you take Pasquale, he'll handle them all in no time. They're just monkeys who crap and pee in the toilet, not in the wild, which is why they act so high and mighty. They claim to know what China should do, what Albania, France, and the Katanga province (Shaba region of Zaire) should do.\"\n[1962-06-05T22:21:00] In Stefano's car | I saw her laughing at her husband. I heard her say, \"Elena, you're the same, I have to tell you, be careful, you're about to become just like them, just like a parrot repeating words. You should listen,\" she said to her husband, then in a whiny voice, \"mumbling. Let Stefano listen, how you talk to those people? You're just like Nino's son.\"\n[1962-06-05T22:22:00] The car of Stefano | I heard, \"‘World Peace Travel,’ we have the ability, the means, hunger, war. You worked so hard in school just to say these words? Who can solve the problem of world peace? Great. Do you remember how Nino's son solved the problem? You do, yes, you listen to him completely? You want to be a doll, play that role, and mingle with those people? I'd rather live in our fucking reality, let myself get beaten up, while you two chatter away! Go to hell with your hunger, your war, your peace, your working class!\"\n[1962-06-05T22:30:00] In Stefano's car | I said nothing on our way home, silently listening to her cruel words. I saw the car pass along Vittorio Emanuele Street. I thought the important moment in my life was something significant, but in her mouth, it had instantly become a hypocritical and ridiculous joke. I didn't want to believe what she said—I felt she was an enemy, capable of doing anything.\n[1962-06-05T22:31:00] In Stefano's car | I thought about how she could make even good people go mad, how she could stir up a destructive rage in someone's heart. I felt that Giullia and Pinochia were right, that the photo had caught fire on its own. I hated her, even Stefano noticed it.\n[1962-06-05T22:40:00] My house's basement | I saw him park the car at our front gate and told me to get out on his side. I heard him say in an apologetic tone, \"Goodbye, Elena, good night, Lina was just joking.\"  \nI whispered \"Goodbye\" and left.\n[1962-06-05T22:41:00] My house's downstairs | I saw the car had started, and I heard Lina shouting at me. I heard her imitating the voice I used at Teacher Galiani's house: \"Goodbye, oh, goodbye.\"\n[1962-06-06T00:00:00] Posillipo | I knew our relationship had broken apart for the first time. From that night on, we began a long separation, and I went through a long, painful period. I couldn't calm down, my emotions remained unsettled. Up until that moment, there had been thousands of reasons that could have broken our relationship, but she had never openly insulted me like she did that night.\n[1962-06-06T10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw later, when I read it in her notebook, how much that gathering had hurt her. I thought about how she had admitted she had asked to come with me, saying she thought that way she could temporarily escape from Capodimonte for the evening, spend a pleasant night with me, and witness and take part in my increasingly broadening world.\n[1962-06-06T10:05:00] Posillipo | I know she wrote in her notebook that she was certain men liked her, that she had always been attractive to men. I thought, but that night, she felt she had nothing to say, no charm, didn't know what to do, and wasn't beautiful.\n[1962-06-06T10:10:00] Posillipo | I saw her note down every detail: when we stood side by side, everyone spoke to me, only to me, they handed me food and drinks, no one took care of her. I know Nadia showed me a painting that was passed down in her family, an ancient painting from the 17th century. She talked to me about it for a full quarter of an hour, completely ignoring Lina's presence, as if she knew nothing at all.\n[1962-06-06T10:15:00] Posillipo | I thought back to that night, when she first felt that her life would forever revolve around Stefano and Capodimonte, around her brother and Pinocchia's marriage, that her life would consist only of chatting with Pasquale and Pinocchia, and of vulgar struggles with the Solara brothers. At that moment, on the spot, she felt a complete loss of self.\n[1962-06-15T09:00:00] Mai Zuo Kannon Street | I never went back to Capodimonte to see her, even though she had bought me the textbooks and even though we had made a bet. Later, I also didn't tell her that I had scored nine in both of my upgrade exams and eight in the rest. I knew that after the school break started, I began working at a bookstore on Via Maio Canone, and I disappeared from our Mergellina, but I didn't tell her.\n[1962-06-20T13:00:00] Mai Zuo Kao Nei Street | I was strolling along Via Mezzocannone during lunch break one day when suddenly I heard someone call my name—Nadia. She was on her way to an exam. I knew he was in college, and the exams were very difficult, but before going to the San Domenico Maggiore district, he still stopped to chat with me for a while.\n[1962-06-20T20:00:00] Bookstore | I saw him running to the bookstore even at night to find me. He got twenty-eight points on his exam, and he was happy. He asked me for my phone number and wondered if I could go for a walk with him on Sunday. I heard myself tell him that on Sunday I would be staying home to help my mother.\n[1962-06-20T20:10:00] Bookstore | I saw him talking again about Latin America, how he planned to go there right after graduating from university, convincing the poor there to take up arms against their oppressors. His conversation was so far-fetched that I had to let him go before my boss got angry. I thought, in any case, I was happy because it was obvious he liked me. I was polite to him, but I wouldn't go out with him.\n[1962-06-21T10:00:00] Bookstore | The next day, another surprise awaited me. I was cleaning the floor of the bookstore when Nino and Nadia appeared before me. Nadia had told them where I worked, and they had come specifically to greet me.\n[1962-06-21T10:05:00] Bookstore | I saw their suggestion that we all go to the movies on Sunday, and I had to refuse by answering Nadia: I can't make it because I'll be working all week, and my parents want me to stay home on Sunday. I heard, \"Can you walk around in Mergellina?\"  \n\"That's possible.\"  \n\"Then we'll come find you on Sunday.\"\n[1962-06-21T10:10:00] Bookstore | I saw them leaving right away. I saw that at this moment, the bookstore owner was calling me in an impatient tone—a man in his sixties with dirty-looking skin, his gaze lecherous and his temper quick.\n[1962-06-24T10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that the following Sunday morning was already quite late. I heard someone calling me from the courtyard, and I recognized it as Nino's voice. I stuck my head out and saw that he had come alone.\n[1962-06-24T10:05:00] Posillipo | In just a few minutes, I had gotten myself together enough to go out and see people. I ran downstairs without telling my mother where I was going. I thought about how very happy, and yet also very uneasy, I was.\n[1962-06-24T10:10:00] Courtyard | I said, out of breath, when I faced him. I heard, \"I only have ten minutes.\" I thought I was going to suffocate.",

    "text": "[1962-06-24T10:15:00] Inside the residential community | I saw that instead of going out for a walk on the main road, we were walking around the buildings in the residential area. I didn't ask him, but he still said it. I knew that Nadia's relatives from her father's side had arrived, so she had to stay at home. Nino insisted on coming anyway, partly to see the Mergellina once more, and also to bring me some reading material — the latest issue of the Southern News magazine.\n[1962-06-24T10:20:00] Inside the residential area | I saw him hand me the magazine, but not very willingly. I thanked him. He said some bad things about the magazine. I heard \"Some dogmas,\" he said with a smile, \"like Professor Galiani, like Nadia.\" I thought, if he said that, why did he still give me the magazine.\n[1962-06-24T10:21:00] Within the residential area | I heard and then he became serious, speaking to me in the manner of an old man. He said he felt he owed his teacher too much. If it hadn't been for her, his entire high school years would have been a waste. But he warned me to be careful with her, to watch out for her. Her biggest flaw, he emphasized, was that she didn't allow anyone to disagree with her. You could take from her what she gave you, but the road ahead you had to walk yourself.\n[1962-06-24T10:22:00] In the residential area | I heard that in the end, his conversation returned to the magazine, and he said that Galiani also wrote for it. He suddenly changed the subject and mentioned Lina: \"If you have the chance, have her read it.\" I thought I never told him that Lina no longer sees anything anymore; she's now Mrs. Karachi, and the only thing that remains of her from when she was a child is her badness.\n[1962-06-24T10:25:00] In the residential area | I asked about Nadezhda instead of avoiding the topic of Lina. He told me that she would be traveling with her family this summer, driving all the way to Norway and then spending the rest of the time in Anakabri, where her father had a house.  \n\"Will you go see her?\"  \n\"I'll go once or twice. I have to study.\"\n[1962-06-24T10:26:00] Within the residential community | I heard, \"Is your mother okay?\"  \n\"She's very well. This year she's going to Balano, and she and the landlord have made up.\"  \n\"Are you going on vacation with your family?\"  \n\"Me? With my father? I wouldn't dream of it. I'm in Vomero, but I'm going alone.\"\n[1962-06-24T10:27:00] Inside the residential area | I heard, \"Where are you going?\"  \n\"I have a friend who has a house in Mergellina. His parents want him to stay there all summer, and we'll study together there. How about you?\"  \n\"I work at a bookstore in Mazzoccolo, until September.\"  \n\"Even on August fifteenth, the Assumption of Mary?\"  \n\"No, I'm not working on August fifteenth.\"\n[1962-06-24T10:28:00] Inside the residential area | I saw him smile. \"I heard, 'Then come to Mergellina, the house is big, maybe Nadia will also come to stay for a couple of days.'\"\n[1962-06-24T10:29:00] Inside the residential community | I saw myself smiling excitedly. I thought about Mergellina? Vomero? In a house without adults? Does he still remember Malvaldi Beach? Does he still remember when we [intimate act] there?\n[1962-06-24T10:30:00] In the residential area | I saw myself saying that I was going back. I heard him say, \"I'll be back.\" He promised, \"I want to know your opinion on this magazine.\" He added in a low voice, his hand in his pocket, \"I like talking to you.\"\n[1962-06-24T10:31:00] Inside the residential area | I said softly, \"I also like talking to you.\" I was about to go through the main gate when something happened that made both of us uneasy. I heard it was a sharp, piercing scream that broke the silence of the Sunday courtyard. I realized that, in fact, he had been talking all along. I suddenly felt proud and moved, because he was at ease in front of me, even though I hadn't said much at all.\n[1962-06-24T10:32:00] Courtyard | I saw Melina stick her head out of the window, spreading her arms to get our attention. At that moment, Nino was also uneasy; he turned around to look. Melina shouted even more loudly, her voice mixed with joy and anxiety as she called, \"Donato.\" I heard \"Who is it?\" Nino asked.  \n\"Melina,\" I said, \"Do you remember?\"\n[1962-06-24T10:33:00] Courtyard | I saw him make an extremely uncomfortable expression. I heard, \"Is she calling me?\"  \n\"I don't know.\"  \n\"She's calling Donato.\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \nHe turned around again to look at Melina's window. The widow was still shouting that name.\n[1962-06-24T10:34:00] Courtyard | I saw him saying it with some unease. I heard, \"Do you think I look like my father?\"  \n\"No.\"  \n\"Are you sure?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"I'm leaving.\"  \n\"Okay.\"\n[1962-06-24T10:35:00] Courtyard | I saw him walking away quickly, his shoulders hunched, and at that moment, Melina shouted even more loudly and excitedly: \"Donato! Donato! Donato!\"\n[1962-06-24T10:40:00] Posillipo | I saw it and quickly ran away, I returned home, my heart still pounding wildly, my thoughts all over the place. I thought about Nino and his father—they didn't look alike at all: not in body type, not in face, not even in movement, voice, or gaze. He wasn't an ordinary child; he was too beautiful. His messy long hair was truly charming. He was nothing like the other males, no one in the entire San Gregorio Armeno looked like him.\n[1962-06-24T10:45:00] Posillipo | I thought about how he even invited me to go to Vomero and Mergellina on August 15th. Although it wasn't a real invitation, since it wasn't feasible for me, he himself knew that, because my parents weren't like Nadezhda's parents, they wouldn't let me go. Yet he still invited me, because the unspoken message he wanted to convey was: I really want to see you.\n[1962-06-24T10:46:00] Posillipo | I thought of a good plan, I'm definitely going! I heard cheers in my mind, and I also really like talking with you—I'll go. On the fifteenth of August, I'll run away from home and meet you, whatever happens.\n[1962-06-24T22:00:00] My small room | I saw myself hiding the magazine inside my textbook. That night, lying in bed, I looked at the magazine's table of contents and sighed softly: there was an article by Nino. I thought about how this article was published in a magazine that looked very serious, unlike the previous one that had been put together by students. I saw Nino's full name—Antonio Nino. I knew him; he was only two years older than me.\n[1962-06-24T22:15:00] My small room | I read the article, but I didn't understand it very well. I read another one, and it was about a \"capitalized plan,\" written in a very complicated way. I thought it was an expression of his intelligence and a part of who he was. He didn't boast about it, but quietly gave it to me. He gave me the magazine that had his article in it—just for me.\n[1962-06-24T23:00:00] My small room | I saw tears welling up in my eyes, and it wasn't until very late that I finally put the magazine down. Would I even want to tell Lina about this? Show her the magazine? No, it's my own thing, and I don't want any more to do with her! They saw in me something Lina didn't want to see. Because her eyes were the eyes of our Mergellina, and she could only remain locked in her own madness, like Melina.\n[1962-06-30T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that at first, I didn't want to attend Pinochia's and Rino's wedding, but she personally delivered the invitation to me, was very warm toward me, and even consulted me on many issues. I couldn't refuse her, even though she only invited me and didn't invite my parents or my younger brothers and sisters.\n[1962-07-01 10:00:00] School | I knew that at the middle school graduation exam, I got eight in all my other subjects, nine in Latin and Italian, and was the best student in the school, better than Alfonso Carracci, who had an average of eight, and far better than Gino.",

    "text": "[1962-07-01 10:05:00] At home | I thought about it for many days, and I was immersed in the joy of being first.\n[1962-07-05 19:00:00] Home | I saw my father praising me, and from that moment on, he began to boast about his eldest daughter in front of everyone: she had scored nine in both Italian and Latin.\n[1962-07-05 19:10:00] Home | I saw her in the kitchen, standing by the sink, washing vegetables. Without turning around, she said to me. What astonished me was my mother.\n[1962-07-05 19:11:00] At home | \"I heard, 'On Sunday, you can wear my silver bracelet, but be careful not to lose it.'\"\n[1962-07-08T10:00:00] Church | I went to Pinocchia's wedding accompanied by Pinocchia and Alfonso Carracci. I saw Lina in the church, sitting in the front row between Stefano and Maria. It was hard for me to ignore her, because she was so dazzling.\n[1962-07-08T13:00:00] Restaurant | I ended up sitting at a rather secluded table, along with Alfonso Carracci, Pinochia, and a golden-haired boy around thirteen years old. I know the wedding reception was held at the same restaurant on Horatius Street, almost a year earlier, when Lina's wedding was also held there. Lina sat with Stefano at the newlyweds' table, which also had some important guests.\n[1962-07-08T13:10:00] Restaurant | I saw Lina talking to Michele, laughing in an exaggerated way. I saw her glancing my way now and then, but I quickly looked away, feeling annoyed and uncomfortable. She always laughed loudly. I thought of her mother, who seemed to be playing the role of a married woman, speaking and acting in a very vulgar way. She had completely captured Michele's attention, even though Michele was sitting next to his girlfriend Giggia.\n[1962-07-08T13:15:00] Restaurant | I saw that Nunzia and Fernando were also looking at their daughter with an helpless gaze. I thought of Lina! Lina! She was always so exaggerated, so reckless, and she made all of us suffer in this way.\n[1962-07-08T13:20:00] Restaurant | I knew that among the invited guests was Gino—the son of the pharmacist—because he had recently become engaged to a niece of the Caracci family. I had been his girlfriend before, but we broke up, and he had never forgiven me. I thought that Gino had become even more repulsive when he grew up. He was despicable before, and he's still the same now; in fact, he even found a chance to show me how much more despicable he had become.\n[1962-07-08T13:30:00] Restaurant | I saw them both come in from outside, joking with each other as they returned to their seats. Gino left his girlfriend, who tried to hold him back, and laughed as he sat down at our table. He pointed to Alfonso Carracci and whispered something to the boy. I heard, \"You have to be careful with that guy, he likes boys: next he'll be taking you to the bathroom with him.\"\n[1962-07-08T13:31:00] Restaurant | I saw Alfonso Carracci red with anger, but he didn't respond. He was so angry he couldn't speak, and only managed a helpless smile. At that moment, Pinocchia lost her temper. I heard, \"How could you say that?\"\n\"I said it because I know.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Yes. Should I tell you?\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"My girlfriend's brother once spent the night at a house in Karachi and had to sleep in the same bed as him.\"\n[1962-07-08T13:32:00] Restaurant | I heard, \"And then?\"\n\"He touched me.\"\n\"Who touched you?\"\n\"It was him.\"\n\"Where's your girlfriend?\"\n\"Over there.\"\n\"Tell that bitch that I can confirm Alfonso Carracci likes women, but I don't know if she can prove you.\"\n[1962-07-08T13:33:00] Restaurant | I saw that, and she turned to face her boyfriend, [intimate action] his lips. In front of everyone, Pinocchia passionately [intimate action] Alfonso Carracci. I thought about this intimate act being so passionate, and I felt I would never have the courage to do it.\n[1962-07-08T13:34:00] Restaurant | I saw Lina keep looking in my direction, as if she were watching me. She was the first to see that [intimate act], and without being able to help herself, she clapped her hands. Michele also started clapping with a smile, and Stefano cheered for his brother. The antique dealer immediately joined in, clapping even louder. In short, whistles filled the air, but Pinocchia pretended not to notice.\n[1962-07-08T13:35:00] Restaurant | I saw her gripping Alfonso Carracci's hand so tightly that the knuckles on her hand turned white. Gino stammered there, looking at them with a dull expression, watching their intimate moment. I heard, \"Get out right now, or I'll slap you.\"\n[1962-07-08T13:36:00] Restaurant | I saw the pharmacist's son say nothing and stand up, returning to his seat. His girlfriend immediately whispered something in his ear, looking very angry. Pinocchia gave them a look full of disdain.\n[1962-07-08T13:40:00] Restaurant | From that moment on, I began to look at Pinocchia with new eyes. I admired her courage, her ability to love wholeheartedly, and her seriousness toward Alfonso Carracci—another person I had overlooked. I felt regret for having been wrong before. I had relied so much on Lina that I saw nothing clearly. How shallow was Lina's applause just now! She was now as repulsive as Michele, Stefano, and that antique dealer.\n[1962-07-08T14:30:00] Restaurant | I turned back and saw Pinocchia standing there, struggling desperately as the antique dealer's wife was pulling her wedding dress upward, revealing her strong, sturdy legs. She was saying this to Stefano. I heard, \"Look at your sister's thighs, look at her ass and stomach. Now you men like those thin girls like a toilet brush, but only girls like our Pinocchia, whom God specially created, are [in a state of childbirth].\"\n[1962-07-08T14:31:00] Restaurant | I saw Lina about to bring a glass of wine to her lips, and without thinking, I poured the drink onto the woman's face and clothes. I thought she was still the same, and I felt very uneasy, thinking that she would surely make a mess of things now that she was acting on her own whims.\n[1962-07-08T14:32:00] Restaurant Toilet | I saw myself sneaking into the bathroom and locking myself in to delay as long as possible. I thought about how I didn't want to see Lina lose her temper, didn't want to hear her speak, and I wanted to stay out of it. I was afraid I'd be pulled into her pain, and I feared feeling that obligation again, standing by her side as I always had.\n[1962-07-08T14:45:00] Restaurant | I saw it all when I went out; everything was calm. Stefano was chatting with the antique dealers, the woman in a soiled dress sitting upright and proud. The band was playing, couples were dancing. Only Lina was missing. I saw her through the glass of the balcony, watching the sea.\n[1962-07-08T14:50:00] Restaurant | I saw that at this moment, Fernando—the father of Lina—appeared beside me, embarrassed and asked if I would like to dance with him. I didn't have the courage to refuse, so I silently danced a waltz with him. Only when the waltz ended did he finally speak to me. I heard, \"If it's not too much trouble, maybe you could talk to Lina, her mother is very worried.\" He then muttered again, \"If you need a pair of shoes, you can come to me, don't be shy.\"\n[1962-07-08T14:55:00] Restaurant | I saw and then he quickly returned to his own table. I thought, that is to say, if I were willing to spend some time on Lina, they would reward me. The last sentence really annoyed me.\n[1962-07-08T15:00:00] Restaurant | I saw that I suggested Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia to leave with me, and they happily accepted my request. Until I left the restaurant, I could feel Nunzia's eyes on me.\n[1962-07-10 16:00:00] Courtyard | I know I'm not very popular in the courtyard, where the only important topic is love between men and women.\n[1962-07-10 16:10:00] Courtyard | I saw when I told Camilla Peluso that I had come first in school, she immediately said to me. I stared at her intently as Alfonso Carracci passed by her.\n[1962-07-10 16:20:00] Courtyard | I saw Giggia Spagnuolo in great pain. I knew she wanted to salvage some dignity because she had failed both her Latin and math exams.\n[1962-07-10 16:21:00] Courtyard | I heard and said that Gino was chasing her, but she didn't want to, because she had fallen in love with Marcello, and maybe Marcello loved her too.",

I heard, \"They didn't give you ten?\"\n[1962-07-12 16:02:00] Unknown | I knew that only the students who consistently performed well could get a perfect score, and the teachers didn't give anyone a ten in the main subjects. I thought I felt very sad.\n[1962-07-12 16:03:00] Unknown | I thought of her words, and my heart immediately started to pound: If she had gone to middle school with me, in the same class, and if her family had allowed it, her current scores would all be ten out of ten.\n[1962-07-12 16:04:00] Unknown | I thought this was something I had always understood, and she did too; she was reminding me of it.\n[1962-07-12 18:00:00] Home | I saw myself returning home, my heart full of pain. I thought that although I had come first, I was not truly the first.\n[1962-07-15 10:00:00] Home | I saw that, meanwhile, my parents had already started discussing how to settle me, and now I already had a junior high school diploma. I knew my mother wanted the owner of the stationery store to make me a salesperson.\n[1962-07-15 10:05:00] Home | I thought that she must have felt I was so good at studying, that I was perfectly suited to sell the school's pens, pencils, notebooks, and books.\n[1962-07-15 10:10:00] Home | I saw my father imagining that through his acquaintances in the city government, he could secure me a good job.\n[1962-07-15 10:15:00] Home | I felt a deep sorrow in my heart, but I couldn't put into words what exactly it was. This sorrow kept rising and swelling, until by the weekend, I didn't even feel like leaving the house.\n[1962-07-15T10:00:00] Bookstore | I saw the bookstore owner treating me like a servant. He made me move heavy boxes, stack them one by one, take the books out of the boxes, put the new books on the shelves, organize the old ones, and clean the dust—never allowing me a moment's rest. To get a look beneath my skirt, he always made me climb up ladders. I knew that in the days to come, I would gradually lose my confidence. I had thought that working in the bookstore would mean having plenty of books to read and time to read them, but I was wrong.\n[1962-07-20 09:00:00] At home | I thought I was no longer satisfied, and everything left me confused.\n[1962-07-20 09:05:00] Home | I often looked at myself in the mirror, but I never saw what I wanted to see. I thought about how my golden hair had now turned chestnut, how my nose was wide and flat, how my body was spreading out sideways instead of growing taller.\n[1962-07-20 09:10:00] Home | I saw that my skin had also gotten really bad: patches of red pimples appeared on my forehead, chin, and cheeks, gradually turning purple, with a yellow tip on each pimple.\n[1962-07-20T10:00:00] Bookstore | I thought about how I had started to feel extremely lonely and irritable. The weather was hot, the work was exhausting, and the bookstore owner's annoying remarks made me feel weak. Time moved slowly. I pondered: What could I possibly do in this bleak cave?\n[1962-07-25 10:00:00] Home | I saw myself starting to take the initiative to clean up, cook, tidy up after my brothers, and take care of my little sister Elena.\n[1962-07-25 14:00:00] At home | When I had free time, I didn't go out but sat in the corner reading the novels I had borrowed from the library: Grazia Deledda, Pirandello, Chekhov, Gogol, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky.\n[1962-07-25 14:10:00] Home | Sometimes I very much wanted to go to Lina's shoe repair shop, to talk with her about the fictional characters I loved, and the lines I had memorized, but in the end I never did.\n[1962-07-25 14:15:00] Home | I knew she would pour cold water on it; she might start talking about her plans with Rino: shoes, the factory, and money.\n[1962-07-25 14:20:00] At home | I thought to myself that I was slowly realizing the novels I read were of no use at all, and my life was very pale.\n[1962-07-25 14:21:00] Home | I thought about how I would one day become a fat, acne-covered saleswoman selling stationery in a shop opposite the church, or else become a government clerk, an old maid who would eventually end up with a squint and a limp.\n[1962-08-01 09:00:00] Home | I saw one day, I received a written invitation with my name on it. I knew that Teacher Ferraro had asked me to go to the library on Sunday morning.\n[1962-08-05 08:00:00] Home | I realized I had to take action, so I started getting ready, trying to look as beautiful as I did when I was a child, pretending I was still the same person I used to be.\n[1962-08-05 08:30:00] Home | I spent a long time squeezing the pimples on my face, and later my face was even redder than before.\n[1962-08-05 08:45:00] Home | I saw myself putting on my mother's silver bracelet and letting my hair down. I thought about it, but still don't like myself; I'm very depressed.\n[1962-08-05 09:00:00] Street | I saw that in that sweltering season, since morning, the heat had wrapped around the entire Mergellina like a feverish hand. I walked to the library.\n[1962-08-05 09:05:00] Library | I saw, I was about to see, there was a small group of people there—elementary school students and their parents, some middle schoolers as well. They were entering through the gate, and the situation was different from usual.\n[1962-08-05 09:10:00] Library | I saw myself go in, and there were rows of chairs, all occupied, with colorful banners on the walls. I saw the priest, Professor Ferraro, even the principal of the primary school and Professor Oliviero.\n[1962-08-05 09:11:00] Library | I saw that borrowing books was temporarily suspended because the reward ceremony was about to start. I thought of the fact that Teacher Ferraro had introduced a reward for outstanding readers, giving a book to those who borrowed the most books according to the registration list.\n[1962-08-05 09:12:00] Library | I saw myself sitting in the last row of the hall, searching with my eyes for Lina, but I only saw Giggia Spagnuolo, who was with Gino and Alfonso Carracci.\n[1962-08-05 09:13:00] Library | I saw myself sitting uneasily on the chair, very uncomfortable.\n[1962-08-05 09:15:00] Library | I saw that after a while, Carmela and her brother Pasquale sat down next to me. We greeted each other. I heard you say \"hello.\" Hello.\n[1962-08-05 09:16:00] Library | I saw myself using my hair to cover my reddening cheeks.\n[1962-08-05 09:20:00] Library | I watched the small award ceremony begin. The winners were: first place Lina Lina, second place Fernando Lina, third place Nunzia Lina, fourth place Rino Lina, fifth place Elena Greco — that's me.\n[1962-08-05 09:25:00] Library | I found it so funny that even Pasquale wanted to laugh; we looked at each other, trying to hold back our laughter.\n[1962-08-05 09:26:00] Library | I saw this, and Camilla whispered. I heard, \"What are you laughing at?\"\n[1962-08-05 09:27:00] Library | I saw that neither of us answered, and we looked at each other again, stifling our laughter with our hands.\n[1962-08-05 09:28:00] Library | I thought about how I felt my eyes were filled with laughter, and suddenly I felt happy.\n[1962-08-05 09:30:00] Library | I saw Teacher Ferraro ask several times whether anyone from Lina's family had shown up, and later I was called up to receive the fifth prize.\n[1962-08-05 09:35:00] Library | I saw Professor Ferraro praising me and handing me Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat.\n[1962-08-05 09:36:00] Library | I saw myself thanking him, then hesitantly asking. \"I heard, 'Can I take the prize from Lina's house too? I'll bring it to them.'\"\n[1962-08-05 09:40:00] Library | I saw the teacher give me all the books that were meant for Lina's family.",

I found his words so amusing that they made me laugh.\n[1962-08-05 10:02:00] Outside the library | I know he was in the same class as Rino when he was in elementary school, and they were even desk mates.\n[1962-08-05 10:03:00] Outside the library | I saw tears of joy in his eyes as he told me that between the two of them—him and his deskmate Rino, helping each other, plus the years they had to repeat, after six or seven years of schooling, the only words they could barely read were: salt, cigarette, Capodimonte, post office, telegram... I heard him ask me what prize the girl who used to sit next to him had received.\n[1962-08-05 10:04:00] Outside the Library | I heard \"The Dead Bruges.\" \"Is it a ghost story?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:05:00] Outside the Library | \"I heard, 'Can I go with you to find him and give him the book? It would be best if I could hand it to him myself, okay?'\"\n[1962-08-05 10:06:00] Outside the library | I saw us laughing again. I heard, \"Sure.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:07:00] Outside the library | I heard, \"They gave the award to Rino? That's hilarious! It was clearly Lina who read those books. My God! That girl is amazing.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:08:00] Outside the Library | I found comfort in Pasquale Peluso's attention to me, and I liked laughing with him. Maybe I'm not that ugly, I thought. Perhaps I just can't appreciate myself.\n[1962-08-05 10:09:00] Outside the Library | I saw that at this moment I heard someone calling me, it was Teacher Oliviero.\n[1962-08-05 10:10:00] Outside the library | I saw myself walking up to her, and she looked at me with a judging gaze, speaking to me in an authoritative tone. I heard, \"You've grown up, you're really beautiful.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:11:00] Outside the library | I thought about her words, and it almost made me confident about my appearance.\n[1962-08-05 10:12:00] Outside the library | I heard, \"Teacher, this isn't true.\" \"It is true. You're like a star, your body is strong and well-built, and you're also doing very well in your studies. I heard you got first place at school.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:13:00] Outside the Library | \"I heard 'Yes.' 'What are you going to do now?' 'I'm going to start work.'\"\n[1962-08-05 10:14:00] Outside the library | I heard her exclaim, \"Don't even think about it! You should keep studying.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:15:00] Outside the library | I saw myself looking at her uneasily. What else was there left for me to learn? I realized I knew nothing about the education system, didn't know what came after middle school, and had no concept of high school or university—they were as abstract to me as the words I'd read in novels.\n[1962-08-05 10:16:00] Outside the library | \"I can't continue studying, my parents won't let me.\" \"What score did the Latin teacher give you?\"\n[1962-08-05 10:17:00] Outside the library | \"I heard 'nine points.' 'Are you sure?' 'Sure.'\"\n[1962-08-05 10:18:00] Outside the library | I heard, \"Then I'll talk to your parents.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:19:00] Outside the library | I saw myself pretending to leave, and I have to say I was a little scared at the time. I thought that if Professor Oliviero really came to my house and my parents continued to support my education, another war would break out at home, and I didn't want to see that scene at all.\n[1962-08-05 10:20:00] Outside the Library | I found I preferred the current situation: helping my mother at home, working in the stationery shop, accepting the pimples on my face, being strong and healthy—just as Professor Oliviero said, living a miserable, hard life.\n[1962-08-05 10:21:00] Outside the library | I know Lina hasn't been to school in three years, right? I thought of the shoemaker's daughter, wasn't she once full of dreams too?\n[1962-08-05 10:22:00] Outside the library | I heard, \"Teacher, thank you,\" I said, \"Goodbye.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:23:00] Outside the library | I saw but Olivieroteacher pulled my arm.\n[1962-08-05 10:24:00] Outside the Library | \"I don't waste time with that man,\" she said, pointing at Pasquale, who was waiting for me. I heard, \"He's a bricklayer, he won't have any future, and his background is terrible. His father was a communist, and he killed Don Achille.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:25:00] Outside the library | I heard, \"I don't want you to see him. He's just like his father, surely a communist.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:26:00] Outside the library | I saw myself nodding in agreement and left without saying hello to Pasquale.\n[1962-08-05 10:27:00] Outside the Library | When it started, he was a bit lost, but then he caught up with me, staying about ten paces behind. I thought he wasn't a very handsome young man, but I wasn't a beautiful girl either.\n[1962-08-05 10:28:00] Outside the library | I saw his curly hair was black, and because he often sunbathed, his skin was dark. His mouth was large.\n[1962-08-05 10:29:00] Outside the library | I thought he was the son of a murderer, maybe even a communist.\n[1962-08-05 10:30:00] Street | I thought about how I was mulling over the word \"Communist Party,\" which meant nothing to me, but in the teacher's mouth, it became a derogatory term.\n[1962-08-05 10:31:00] Street | I thought of Communist Party! Communist Party! Communist Party! I found the word fascinating, Communist Party, the son of a murderer.\n[1962-08-05 10:35:00] Street | At that moment, I had reached the turn, and Pasquale caught up with me. We walked together for a while, all the way to a place very near my house.\n[1962-08-05 10:36:00] Street | I saw us laughing again, and we made plans to meet the next day, going together to the cobbler's shop to give those books to Lina and Rino.\n[1962-08-05 10:37:00] Street | I saw, before leaving, Pasquale say to me. I heard that he, his sister, and several others who are willing to go to Giggia's house will all learn to dance next Sunday.\n[1962-08-05 10:38:00] Street | I saw him ask me if I wanted to go, and he also said I could bring Lina along. I was so surprised that I opened my mouth in disbelief. I knew my mother wouldn't let me go, but I still said, \"Okay, I'll think about it.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:39:00] Street | I saw him reach out his hand, a gesture I wasn't yet used to, so I hesitated for a moment before gently shaking his hand.\n[1962-08-05 10:40:00] Street | I saw myself and immediately pulled my hand back. I saw and felt his hand was hard and rough.\n[1962-08-05 10:41:00] Street | \"I heard you say, 'You've always been a bricklayer?' I asked him, even though I already knew what he did. 'Yes.'\"\n[1962-08-05 10:42:00] Street | I saw him looking at me with an uneasy gaze. I heard, \"Are you a communist?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1962-08-05 10:43:00] Street | I saw him become very serious. I heard, \"Are you going to visit your father at the Prison of Poggio?\" \"Whenever I get the chance,\" I said.\n[1962-08-05 10:44:00] Street | I heard \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\"\n[1962-08-05 15:00:00] Home | I saw that afternoon, Professor Oliviero came to my house unexpectedly without any prior notice.\n[1962-08-05 15:05:00] Home | I thought about how her visit made my father very nervous and my mother extremely anxious.",

I heard they were going to send me to the nearest liberal arts high school, she said she would help me find the textbooks for school.\n[1962-08-05 15:11:00] Home | When I saw her looking at me with a stern expression while she was speaking to my father. I heard her say she saw me walking alone with Pasquale Peluso, which was improper.\n[1962-08-05 15:12:00] Home | I heard that because I was a girl with a bright future, he wasn't even worthy to be with me.\n[1962-08-05 15:15:00] At home | I saw them solemnly assure the teacher that they would let me go to high school. I thought about how I saw that my parents lacked the courage to argue with her.\n[1962-08-05 15:16:00] Home | I saw my father with a dark expression saying. I heard, \"Rino, be careful! Don't talk to Pasquale anymore.\"\n[1962-08-05 15:17:00] Home | Before she left, she asked me about Lina.\n[1962-08-05 15:18:00] Home | I saw her and told her that Lina was helping to keep the books at her father and brother's shop. I heard her say, \"Does she know you got a nine in Latin?\" and she made a scornful face as she asked me.\n[1962-08-05 15:19:00] Home | I saw myself nodding. I heard, \"Tell her you're now studying Greek, tell her!\"\n[1962-08-05 15:20:00] Home | I watched until the end, and she stood tall and proud as she said goodbye to my parents, sighing. I heard, \"This girl will be your pride!\"\n[1962-08-05 15:21:00] Home | I watched until the end, and she bid farewell to my parents with her head held high, sighing as she said. I heard, \"This girl will be your pride!\"\n[1962-08-05 20:00:00] Home | I saw that night, my mother was furious. I heard that now I have to be sent to a school for rich people, otherwise Teacher Oliviero will keep bothering us and might even take revenge by making little Elena fail her exams.\n[1962-08-05 20:05:00] At home | I heard him threaten me that if he found me alone with Pasquale Peluso again, he would break my leg. I thought about how my father was concerned with another issue.\n[1962-08-05 20:06:00] Home | At that moment, we heard a scream — it was Pinocchio, Melina's daughter, shouting \"Help!\"\n[1962-08-05 20:07:00] By the window | I saw us both running to the window. I saw the courtyard in a messy turmoil.\n[1962-08-05 20:08:00] By the window | I know we all know that since Nino's family moved away, Melina has usually behaved quite well.\n[1962-08-05 20:09:00] By the window | I know she was certainly melancholy, a bit distracted, but her strange behavior had become rare and hardly disturbed anyone.\n[1962-08-05 20:10:00] By the window | I know, for example, that when she was very sick, she would sing loudly while cleaning the stairs; she'd dump the dirty water onto the street without even looking to see if anyone was around.\n[1962-08-05 20:11:00] By the window | I saw that she was having another episode of mental instability. I thought I was finally happy, but I had [mental health issues] again.\n[1962-08-05 20:12:00] By the window | I saw her laughing, jumping on the bed at home.\n[1962-08-05 20:13:00] By the window | I saw her lift her dress and reveal her thin thighs and underpants to the frightened children.\n[1962-08-05 20:14:00] By the window | I saw her asking the other women who had stuck their heads out of the window. I thought my mother was very familiar with such matters.\n[1962-08-05 20:15:00] By the window | I saw Nunzia Lina and Lina come downstairs to see what was happening.\n[1962-08-05 20:16:00] By the window | I saw it, but my mother stopped me. I thought to myself that I wanted to go out and join them.\n[1962-08-05 20:17:00] By the window | I saw her fix her hair and then go out, limping, to investigate.\n[1962-08-05 20:18:00] By the window | I saw that she was having another episode, laughing loudly as she jumped on the bed at home. I thought to myself that this time I was truly happy, [with a mental health issue].\n[1962-08-05 20:19:00] By the window | I saw her lift her skirt and reveal her thin thighs and underpants to the frightened children.\n[1962-08-05 20:20:00] By the window | I saw that my mother was very familiar with such matters; she inquired of the other women who had stuck their heads out of the window. I saw Nunzia Lina and Lina go downstairs to see what was happening.\n[1962-08-05 20:21:00] By the window | I saw her fix her hair and then go out, limping, to find out for herself. I thought about wanting to go out and join them, but my mother stopped me.\n[1962-08-05 20:25:00] Home | I saw her return, and she looked a bit angry. I heard that someone sent a book to Melina.\n[1962-08-05 20:26:00] At home | I know Melina never went beyond the second grade and has never read a single book in her life. I thought yes, a book.\n[1962-08-05 20:27:00] Home | I saw the name Donato Nino on the cover of the book, and on the first page, in pen, there was a dedication that also included the name Melina.\n[1962-08-05 20:28:00] Home | I saw in red ink: These poems are for her.\n[1962-08-05 20:30:00] Home | I saw my father hearing about this strange incident and cursed the railway worker and poet repeatedly.\n[1962-08-05 20:31:00] Home | I heard my mother say that someone really should break that bastard's head.\n[1962-08-05 20:40:00] Home | I saw her return, and she looked a bit angry. I heard that someone sent a book to Melina.\n[1962-08-05 20:41:00] Home | I saw the name Donato Nino on the cover of the book, and on the first page, in pen, there was a dedication written: \"To Melina,\" with red ink above it: \"These poems are for her.\" I know Melina never went beyond the second grade and has never read a single book in her life.\n[1962-08-05 20:45:00] Home | I saw my father hearing about this strange incident and cursed the railway worker and poet many times. I heard my mother say that someone really should break that bastard's head.\n[1962-08-05 21:00:00] Home | I watched all night; we all heard Melina singing happily.\n[1962-08-05 21:05:00] Home | I saw them trying their best to calm my mother down, but they failed. I saw and heard several children—especially Antonio and Pinocchio's voices.\n[1962-08-05 22:00:00] Home | I thought about this amazing thing that had shaken me.\n[1962-08-05 22:05:00] At home | I thought about how on the same day, I had attracted a mysterious young man named Pasquale; before me there suddenly appeared a new school.\n[1962-08-05 22:10:00] Home | I thought of another person who used to live in Mergellina—right across from us, and he published a book.\n[1962-08-05 22:15:00] At home | I thought that in the end, this proved that Lina was right, and the possibility of having a book published could also happen to us.\n[1962-08-05 22:16:00] Home | I thought, although she had given up, what about me? Maybe I'll write a book myself, like Nino, who knows?\n[1962-08-05 22:17:00] Home | I thought that if things went smoothly, I might become rich before Lina finished making her shoes and established her shoe factory.\n[1962-08-05 23:00:00] Home | I watched all night; we all heard Melina singing happily, and we could hear the children—especially Antonio and Pinochietta—trying to calm their mother down, but they failed.\n[1962-08-05 23:10:00] Home | I thought about this amazing thing that left me stunned: on the same day, I attracted a mysterious young man named Pasquale; a new school suddenly appeared before me; and I also discovered someone who had once lived in Mergellina—someone who lived across from our building, and who had published a book.\n[1962-08-05 23:15:00] Home | I thought that in the end, this proved that Lina was right, that the possibility of having a book published could also happen to us.\n[1962-08-05 23:20:00] Home | I thought I might write a book myself, like Nino, maybe? If things go well, I might become rich before Lina makes her shoes and starts her shoe factory.",

    "text": "[1962-08-06 09:00:00] Street | I saw the next day, according to the time I had agreed with Pasquale Peluso, I slipped out quietly.\n[1962-08-06 09:05:00] Street | I saw him running toward me, out of breath. I saw, I saw him wearing the clothes of a construction worker, drenched in sweat, his shirt covered with white spots of lime.\n[1962-08-06 09:10:00] Street | I told him about Donato and Melina on the way. I heard myself say to him that the recent events proved that Melina wasn't crazy, that Donato had truly fallen in love with her and still did.\n[1962-08-06 09:15:00] Street | I saw that Pasquale agreed when I said those words. I thought I sensed his great interest in love.\n[1962-08-06 09:16:00] Street | I thought about the latest developments in this matter, and what most excited me was that Donato Nino had recently published a book.\n[1962-08-06 09:20:00] Street | I thought about it and realized that the latest development in this matter, which most excited me, was that Donato Nino had recently published a book.\n[1962-08-06 09:25:00] Street | I know that this railway employee has become the author of a book. I thought to myself that Professor Ferraro could certainly put this book in his library for everyone to borrow.\n[1962-08-06 09:30:00] Street | I saw I told Pasquale. I heard that we all knew an extraordinary man: Donato seemed completely controlled by his wife Lydia, but he was actually a poet.\n[1962-08-06 09:35:00] Street | I saw that his tragic love story was unfolding right before our eyes. I heard that it was a person we all knew well, Melina, who inspired him.\n[1962-08-06 09:40:00] Street | I felt extremely excited, my heart was pounding, but I realized that when it came to this topic, Pasquale couldn't keep up with my thoughts. He just agreed to avoid going against me.\n[1962-08-06 09:45:00] Street | I saw that after a while, he started changing the subject, asking me about Lina. I heard how she's doing at school? How is she as a person? Are we still friends or not, and so on.\n[1962-08-06 09:50:00] Street | I was enthusiastically talking all the way. I thought I would be happy to answer his question, the first time someone had ever asked me about our friendship.\n[1962-08-06 09:55:00] Street | I tried to downplay my relationship with Lina, suppressing many loud expressions and exclamations. I thought about how I had never before felt the need to find the right words to talk about our friendship, until now.\n[1962-08-06 10:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the cobbler's shop, and we were still talking about the subject. I know Fernando has gone home to take a nap.\n[1962-08-06 10:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina and Rino sitting face to face, both looking down at something with expressions of dissatisfaction. I saw their faces were full of gloom.\n[1962-08-06 10:06:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw them through the glass door and immediately put everything away.\n[1962-08-06 10:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw myself giving Professor Ferraro's prize to Lina.\n[1962-08-06 10:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that at this moment, Pasquale and his friend Rino were joking around, opening the book he had won in front of him, teasing him. I heard, \"After you finish reading The Dead Bruges, tell me if you like it. If it's well written, I'll read it too.\"\n[1962-08-06 10:16:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the two of them laughing, whispering about Bruges. I heard, of course, something utterly disgusting.\n[1962-08-06 10:17:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that even though Pasquale was joking with Rino, he secretly glanced at Lina. I thought to myself that I had noticed it.\n[1962-08-06 10:18:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I wondered why he looked at her that way? What was he searching for? What did he see? That meaningful glance, Lina hadn't even noticed.\n[1962-08-06 10:19:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him drag Pasquale into the street, as if trying to prevent us from hearing their joke. I thought that Rino had noticed it more than me, and in fact, he hated the way his friends looked at my sister.\n[1962-08-06 10:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw myself accompanying Lina to the room at the back of the shop, and I tried hard to watch her. I thought about what it was that had caught Pasquale's attention in her.\n[1962-08-06 10:21:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her still as the frail little girl: bony, pale, her only attraction possibly her big eyes and the slight rise and fall of her chest. I thought she was still the same as ever.\n[1962-08-06 10:22:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her put those books among her own books, old shoes, and some crumpled notebooks.\n[1962-08-06 10:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that I had mentioned Melina's mental health issues to her. What I want, above all, is to convey my excitement to her.\n[1962-08-06 10:26:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard myself finally say that we knew someone who had just published a book—Donato Nino.\n[1962-08-06 10:27:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw myself speaking to her in standard Italian. \"I heard, 'Think about it, his son Nino went to the same school as us, and Nino's family got rich.'\"\n[1962-08-06 10:28:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her make a hesitant smile, full of doubt. I heard her say, \"You mean this book?\"\n[1962-08-06 10:29:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her reach out and show me the book by Nino.\n[1962-08-06 10:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I knew the book was given to her by Melina's eldest son, Antonio, who didn't want his mother to see it.\n[1962-08-06 10:31:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the book I had taken and looked at it carefully. I saw that the title of this poetry collection was Clear Proof, the cover was red, and the design showed a radiant sun atop a mountain.\n[1962-08-06 10:32:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the cover of the poetry collection, which was inscribed with the name Donato Nino. I thought about how excited I was.\n[1962-08-06 10:33:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw myself opening the book and reading aloud the dedication on it. I heard, \"To Melina, who inspired me. Donato, San Gregorio Armeno, June 12, 1958.\"\n[1962-08-06 10:34:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I said, \"Nino will have a car, even more beautiful than the Sorrento brothers' car.\" I felt excited, a tingling sensation ran down my neck, spreading all the way to the ends of my hair.\n[1962-08-06 10:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina looking at me with her usual gaze, fixed on the book in my hand.\n[1962-08-06 10:36:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard her mutter, \"Whatever is going to happen, we'll find out soon enough.\" She said, \"So far, these poems have only brought disaster.\"\n[1962-08-06 10:37:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Why?\" \"Nino didn't have the courage to come to Melina himself; he sent her this book.\"\n[1962-08-06 10:38:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Isn't this a beautiful thing?\" \"Who knows? Now Melina is waiting for him. If Nino doesn't come, she'll suffer even more than before.\"\n[1962-08-06 10:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw my eyes on her pale skin. I saw that her face was very smooth, not a single pimple in sight. I thought of such a brilliant analysis!\n[1962-08-06 10:41:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the delicate contours of her lips and ears as I looked at her. I thought so. I suppose she's changed, not just physically, but her way of expressing herself has changed too.\n[1962-08-06 10:42:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought that, in today's terms, she could not only explain something clearly in a tone I was familiar with, but even more clearly than when I was a child.\n[1962-08-06 10:43:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that now, by listing facts, she naturally enhanced their weight, and with just a few sentences, she heightened the impact of the situation. I thought, and happily realized that when she expressed her opinions, I felt I also had the ability to speak like that.\n[1962-08-06 10:44:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I tried it and the effect was very good. I thought happily to myself, this is the difference between me and Camilla and the other girls: I can talk with her passionately and respond to her.\n[1962-08-06 10:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw how strong her hands were! How graceful her movements and her gaze were! I thought to myself, sighing.\n[1962-08-06 10:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | When Lina and I were talking and analyzing love, the pleasure of our conversation suddenly stopped because I had a very ugly thought. I suddenly realized that I had been wrong.\n[1962-08-06 10:51:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought of the mason Pasquale, the son of a killer, who had brought me here not for me, but for her, just to have a chance to see her.\n[1962-08-06 10:55:00] Shoemaker's Shop | The moment I think about it, I suddenly can't catch my breath.\n[1962-08-06 11:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw two young men come in from outside and interrupted our conversation.\n[1962-08-06 11:01:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Pasquale smiling as he confessed. I heard that when he came out from the construction site, he didn't tell the foreman, and he had to go back to work immediately.\n[1962-08-06 11:02:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that he was still staring at Lina, almost as if he couldn't help himself. I thought about what he said, and maybe it was meant to imply that: I risked being fired just to see you.\n[1962-08-06 11:03:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw it all, and then he said to Rino. I heard, \"Sunday, we're all going to Giggia's house, and Elena is coming too. Are you going?\"\n[1962-08-06 11:04:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Rino answer. I heard, \"Sunday is still a long way off, we'll think about it.\"\n[1962-08-06 11:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Pasquale glance at Lina again, but Lina didn't notice at all.\n[1962-08-06 11:06:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I watched until the end, and he didn't even ask if I wanted to go with him before leaving quickly.\n[1962-08-06 11:07:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Pasquale glance at Lina again, but Lina didn't notice at all. In the end, he didn't even ask if I wanted to go with him before leaving quickly. \"I heard, 'Sunday is still far away, we'll think about it.' Rino answered.\"\n[1962-08-06 11:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I felt very uncomfortable and anxious. I thought about how I kept running my fingers over my reddening cheeks, but once I became aware of it, I forced myself not to do so.\n[1962-08-06 11:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Rino pull something out from under the workbench, and he examined it uneasily. I knew that was what they had been busy with before we arrived.\n[1962-08-06 11:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I tried again to talk to Lina about books and love.\n[1962-08-06 11:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw us talking freely about Nino, about Melina's wild love, and about the role of the book. What do you think is happening now?\n[1962-08-06 11:26:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how much passion could be rekindled in that woman's heart just by looking at the book's cover, its title, and the name on it—without even reading its contents!\n[1962-08-06 11:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that we were talking so intensely that eventually Rino lost his patience and shouted at us. I heard, \"Have you two had enough? Lina, let's see how we're going to do this. Dad will be back in a minute, and then we'll be stuck doing nothing!\"\n[1962-08-06 11:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I stopped talking, and I took a look at what he was doing. I saw that it was a wooden last, surrounded by a chaotic mess of soles, strips of leather, thick pieces of leather, knives, various sizes of awls, and other tools.\n[1962-08-06 11:36:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard Lina say to me that she and Rino were trying to make a pair of travel shoes for a man.\n[1962-08-06 11:37:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her brother get anxious very quickly, and he made me swear on my sister Elena's life that I would never tell anyone about this. I knew they were working behind Fernando's back, and Rino got some leather through a friend who did odd jobs at the \"Casanova\" leather factory.\n[1962-08-06 11:38:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know they use some scattered moments, five minutes today and ten minutes tomorrow, to make the shoes, because they couldn't convince their father to help them.\n[1962-08-06 11:39:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know it's not just that—every time they mentioned the matter, Fernando would become furious and tell Lina to go home immediately, saying he didn't want to see her in the shop anymore.\n[1962-08-06 11:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know he also threatened to kill Rino, saying that he was already nineteen years old and still so unreasonable, not respecting his father at all.\n[1962-08-06 11:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that I was pretending to be interested in their secret operation. I know that, even though both siblings regarded me as their confidant, even though I could only be a witness to this matter. I thought that later, I felt regretful.\n[1962-08-06 11:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought of Lina walking alone along this road, accomplishing great things. What saddened me most was this: after we had passionately discussed poetry and love, she saw me off at the door, and yet she found a pair of shoes more interesting than love?\n[1962-08-06 11:51:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how our conversations about Nino and Melina were so fascinating. What I couldn't believe was that when she talked about the pile of skins and tools, she immediately forgot about the woman who had suffered for love, while I still couldn't get her out of my mind.\n[1962-08-06 11:52:00] Shoemaker's Shop | What does making shoes have to do with me?\n[1962-08-06 11:53:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about my heart, my eyes, still experiencing the passion of love, that broken fidelity, and the love song written into a book. It felt like the time when I and she read a novel together in the shop, and on a weekend watched a tragic film in the church cinema.",

    "text": "[1962-08-06 11:54:00] Outside the Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her look confused, as if she didn't know what to say. Finally, she uttered a disjointed sentence. I heard, \"Last week, my period came.\"\n[1962-08-06 11:55:00] The door of the cobbler's shop | I saw that even though Rino didn't call her, she went in.\n[1962-08-06 12:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | The mismatched emotions I saw caused me pain, and I had to leave. I thought about how she preferred the adventure on her shoes rather than our conversation; because she was independent, while I needed her; because she had a world she could throw herself into.\n[1962-08-06 12:01:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how it was Pasquale, a man older than us, not a boy, and he must have found other opportunities to see her, to flirt with her, to secretly become her boyfriend, to be intimate with her, to touch her, just like any other couple.\n[1962-08-06 12:02:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, in the end, now I feel that I am becoming increasingly unnecessary for her.\n[1962-08-06 12:05:00] The shoemaker's shop door | I said suddenly, I'm going to high school, as if to drive away my inner discomfort at the time, to emphasize my worth, and my irreplaceable position in her life. I thought about how I told her at the shop's entrance, by which time I had already reached the road.\n[1962-08-06 12:06:00] The door of the cobbler's shop | I told her that the decision had been imposed on my parents by Professor Oliviero, and she also said she would get textbooks for me to use at school, as well as some free old books.\n[1962-08-06 12:07:00] Outside the cobbler's shop | I thought that way because I wanted her to realize: I am unique, even if she might get rich with Rino making shoes, she would never be able to do without me, just like I could never do without her.\n[1962-08-06 12:08:00] At the shoemaker's shop door | I saw her looking at me uneasily. I heard her ask, \"What is high school?\"\n[1962-08-06 12:09:00] The shoemaker's shop door | I heard, \"It's the school you go to after finishing middle school.\" \"What are you going to high school for?\" \"To study, of course.\"\n[1962-08-06 12:10:00] Outside the cobbler's shop | \"I heard, 'What are you learning?' 'Latin.' 'Just that?'\"\n[1962-08-06 12:11:00] At the shoemaker's shop door | I heard, \"Still studying Greek?\" \"Greek?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1962-08-06 12:12:00] At the shoemaker's shop door | I saw her look very confused, as if she didn't know what to say. Finally, she said something that made no sense. I heard, \"Last week, my period came.\"\n[1962-08-06 12:13:00] At the shoemaker's shop door | I saw that even though Rino didn't call her, she went inside.\n[1962-08-06 12:15:00] Street | I thought that she was also bleeding, the secret movement inside her body, first happening to me, then spreading to her like an earthquake wave, changing her, and it had already begun to change her.\n[1962-08-06 12:16:00] Street | I thought, and I thought that Pasquale had discovered this earlier than me. It might not just be him—maybe other boys had noticed it too.\n[1962-08-06 12:17:00] Street | I thought about the fact that I was going to high school, and the glamour of it quickly faded.\n[1962-08-10 10:00:00] Home | I've been thinking about this for several days, wondering about the changes that might have happened to Lina, whether she might have become as beautiful as Pinocchia, Giggia, or Carmela.\n[1962-08-10 10:05:00] Home | I saw myself returning home and looking at my reflection in the mirror. I wondered if I was really that ugly. Would she become ugly like me? What would she turn into, anyway?\n[1962-08-12 15:00:00] Home | I saw myself beginning to dress up.\n[1962-08-12 15:30:00] Street | I remember a Sunday afternoon when I walked from the main road to the small park, dressed in my usual holiday clothes: a sky-blue dress with a large square neckline, and my mother's silver bracelet on my wrist.\n[1962-08-12 15:40:00] Small Park | I saw Lina. I saw her as usual, her dark hair in disarray, wearing an old, faded dress. I thought I felt a very secret joy.\n[1962-08-12 15:41:00] Small Park | I thought she was no different from usual, still that neurotic, thin girl.\n[1962-08-12 15:42:00] Small Park | I know she was once very small, but now she's almost as tall as me, maybe just a centimeter shorter. I thought she had grown a bit taller.\n[1962-08-12 15:43:00] Small Park | I wondered where exactly her changes had been. At that time, my chest was already big, already shaped like that of a mature woman.\n[1962-08-12 15:50:00] Small Park | I saw us walking all the way to the small park, then back again, and then once more into the park.\n[1962-08-12 15:51:00] Small Park | I knew the time was still early, and there was no usual Sunday noise yet; the vendors selling fried peanuts, walnuts, and broad beans had not arrived yet.\n[1962-08-12 15:55:00] Small Park | I saw Lina ask me carefully about high school. I didn't know much, so I exaggerated and told her everything I knew.\n[1962-08-12 15:56:00] Small Park | I thought about how I wanted to arouse her curiosity, to make her long to know about my life outside, to involve her in my experiences, to make her feel that she was losing a part of me, just as I feared losing her.\n[1962-08-12 16:00:00] Small Park | I saw myself walking on the side of the road, and her on the other side. When I spoke, she listened very carefully.\n[1962-08-12 16:05:00] Small Park | I saw later that the Solara brothers' \"Fiat 1100\" pulled up, driven by Michele, with Marcello sitting beside him.\n[1962-08-12 16:06:00] Small Park | I saw Marcello start making humorous remarks to us, teasing us. I heard, to be precise, not just what was said to me, but to both me and Lina.\n[1962-08-12 16:07:00] Small Park | I saw him singing like that in his dialect. I heard such a beautiful lady! You keep walking back and forth, aren't you tired? Look! San Gregorio Armeno is that big, it's the most beautiful city in the world, as beautiful as you. Come up here! In half an hour, we'll send you back.\n[1962-08-12 16:08:00] Small Park | I thought I shouldn't have done it. I should have pretended not to see him and Michele, not to see the car. I should have kept walking, continued talking to Lina, and ignored him.\n[1962-08-12 16:09:00] Small Park | I saw it, but to prove to myself that I was charming and lucky, I was about to go to the school that the wealthy attended, where I would meet other boys with more beautiful cars.\n[1962-08-12 16:10:00] Small Park | I saw myself turn around and say in Italian. I heard, \"Thank you, but we can't...\"\n[1962-08-12 16:11:00] Small Park | I saw that at that moment, Marcello extended a hand. I thought that although he was tall, he was already a fully developed man.\n[1962-08-12 16:12:00] Small Park | I saw his five fingers sticking out of the car window, grabbing my arm. I saw it, but I saw that the hand was broad, with short fingers.\n[1962-08-12 16:13:00] Small Park | I saw him saying. I heard, \"Michele, stop the car for a second. Look, the concierge's daughter is wearing such a beautiful bracelet!\"\n[1962-08-12 16:14:00] Small Park | I saw the car stop. Marcello grabbed my wrist, twisting my arm and taking the bracelet from my hand.\n[1962-08-12 16:15:00] Small Park | I saw the bracelet lying on the road between the car and the sidewalk, broken.\n[1962-08-12 16:16:00] Small Park | I saw \"Oh my God! Look what you've done!\" and I thought of my mother, so I screamed. \"I'm not in a hurry,\" he said as he opened the car door and got out, \"Now I'll fix it for you.\"\n[1962-08-12 16:17:00] Small Park | I saw him about to reach out and grab my arm again, trying to act more familiar, to calm me down. I thought he was pleasant and courteous.\n[1962-08-12 16:18:00] Small Park | At that moment, Lina suddenly came over—she pushed Marcello into the car and pressed a leather-cutting knife against his throat. I saw that her height was only half of Marcello's.\n[1962-08-12 16:19:00] Small Park | I saw her speak in a slow, unhurried way, using the local dialect. I heard, \"If you dare touch her again, I'll show you what will happen.\"\n[1962-08-12 16:20:00] Small Park | I saw Marcello motionless, stunned.\n[1962-08-12 16:21:00] Small Park | I saw Michele quickly get out of the car and he said with certainty. I heard, \"Marcello, what can that little slut do to you? She doesn't have the guts.\"\n[1962-08-12 16:22:00] Small Park | \"I'm coming,\" Lina said, \"you come here, so you can see if I have the guts or not.\"\n[1962-08-12 16:23:00] Small Park | I saw Michele lingering around the car. At that moment, I started crying.\n[1962-08-12 16:24:00] Small Park | I saw from my angle that the knife had already cut Marcello's skin, leaving a small wound from which a thread of blood flowed.\n[1962-08-12 16:25:00] Small Park | I saw Lina standing next to Marcello, as if there was a dangerous insect on his face, and she was trying to brush it away. I remember the scene very clearly in my mind: it was still very hot, and there were few people on the street.\n[1962-08-12 16:26:00] Small Park | I remember clearly what happened; at that moment, her attitude was very clear: she would have no hesitation in cutting Marcello's throat.\n[1962-08-12 16:27:00] Small Park | I saw that Michele had also realized it.\n[1962-08-12 16:28:00] Small Park | \"I see. You're pretty good,\" he said, still calm, almost humorous. He returned to his car. \"I heard, 'Come on! Marcello, apologize to the two ladies, let's go.'\"\n[1962-08-12 16:29:00] Small Park | I saw Lina slowly lower the knife from Marcello's neck. I saw him smile shyly, his eyes a little flustered.\n[1962-08-12 16:30:00] Small Park | I heard \"Wait a minute,\" he said. I heard him kneeling on the sidewalk in front of me, as if offering an apology through the greatest possible humility.\n[1962-08-12 16:31:00] Small Park | I saw him fumble underneath the car and found the bracelet.\n[1962-08-12 16:32:00] Small Park | I saw him look at it carefully, tightening the silver ring with his fingernail, and fixed the bracelet.\n[1962-08-12 16:33:00] Small Park | I saw him hand me the bracelet, but his eyes were on Lina. I heard him say, \"I'm sorry.\"\n[1962-08-12 16:34:00] Small Park | I saw and then got into the car and left.\n[1962-08-12 16:35:00] Small Park | I saw what I said. I heard, \"I was crying not because I was afraid, but because of the bracelet.\"",

    "text": "[1962-08-15 08:00:00] Home | I remember one morning, my father took me out. I knew that summer, the boundary of Mergellina was slowly dissolving.\n[1962-08-15 08:05:00] Street | I saw that I had to go register for high school. I thought he wanted to take this opportunity to make me figure out which bus to take and which route to follow to the new school I was supposed to go to in October.\n[1962-08-15 08:10:00] Street | I saw that it was a very clear day, with a breeze and excellent weather.\n[1962-08-15 08:15:00] Street | I thought about how I felt deeply cherished, and my feelings for my father quickly turned into admiration.\n[1962-08-15 08:20:00] Street | I saw that he knew where to take the subway, the tram, and the bus. I thought about how familiar he was with this vast city.\n[1962-08-15 08:30:00] Street | I saw him being friendly on the way. I thought it was a very composed form of courtesy; he never behaved that way at home.\n[1962-08-15 09:00:00] On the bus | I saw that in the bus and the office, he could get along with anyone. I thought about how he always made it known that he worked at the city hall, that he could help speed up procedures and open some doors.\n[1962-08-15 09:30:00] Train Station | I saw us spending a day together, the first time in my life. I thought I had never felt that before.\n[1962-08-15 09:35:00] Train Station | I saw that he was paying attention to me. I thought that, in just a few hours, he was going to pass on to me everything he had learned in life that was useful.\n[1962-08-15 09:40:00] Train Station | I saw him showing me the Garibaldi Square and the train station under construction.\n[1962-08-15 09:41:00] Train Station | I heard him say that the train station would be built very advanced, so even the Japanese would come here to study its structure and then build an exact copy back home, especially the columns, which were very beautiful.\n[1962-08-15 09:42:00] Train Station | I saw it, but he confessed to me that he preferred the old train station because it was more emotional. I heard there's nothing we can do about it. San Gregorio Armeno has always been like this: split apart, break down, then rebuild again. Money flows, creating opportunities for work.\n[1962-08-15 10:00:00] Street | I saw him take me to Garibaldi Street, all the way to where I had to go to school.\n[1962-08-15 10:10:00] School | I saw him chatting warmly with the secretary, and his tone was always likable. I thought that at our Mergellina and at home, he would hide that tone.\n[1962-08-15 10:15:00] School | I saw him showing off my grades in front of a custodian, and at school he also found an acquaintance, someone from the same faction.\n[1962-08-15 10:16:00] School | I saw and heard him constantly saying \"Is everything okay?\" or \"We can only do our best.\"\n[1962-08-15 11:00:00] City area | I took him to see Piazza Carlo III, the homes of the poor, the botanical garden, Via Flora, and the museum.\n[1962-08-15 12:00:00] City center | I saw him take me to Constantinople Street, then to the Port of Alba, Dante Square, and the Toledo district.\n[1962-08-15 12:10:00] Downtown | I saw my mind full of names. I saw the bustling sounds of cars and people on the road, the rich colors, and the festive atmosphere around me.\n[1962-08-15 12:15:00] City center | I tried very hard to write down everything I saw, so I could tell Lina about it when I got back.\n[1962-08-15 12:30:00] Downtown | I saw my father chatting humorously with a pizza maker, and he bought me a hot, cheesy pizza. He also got me a golden peach from the fruit stand.\n[1962-08-15 12:35:00] City center | I wondered if it was possible that only our Mergellina was filled with violence, while other parts of the city were radiant and peaceful?\n[1962-08-15 13:00:00] City Hall | I saw him take me to the municipal building where he worked.\n[1962-08-15 13:05:00] City Hall | I heard him say that everything there was new, the trees had all been cut down, and the old houses had been torn down: now look how spacious it is, the only old thing is the Azzurro Castle, delicate and beautiful. Governor Azzurro, two real men were your father and him.\n[1962-08-15 13:10:00] City Hall | I saw us walking toward the government building; he greeted this one and that one, he knew so many people.\n[1962-08-15 13:15:00] City Hall | I saw that he was especially familiar with some people, and he introduced me to them. I've heard it said countless times that I got a nine in Italian at school, and also a nine in Latin.\n[1962-08-15 13:20:00] City Hall | I saw that he hardly spoke to anyone else. I just heard him say, \"Well, yes, I'll do as you say.\"\n[1962-08-15 13:25:00] City Hall | I saw it all, and then he announced that he wanted me to take a close look at Mount Vesuvius and the sea.\n[1962-08-15 13:30:00] By the sea | I thought it was a very unforgettable moment.\n[1962-08-15 13:31:00] By the sea | I saw us walking together toward the seaside road. I saw and felt the wind getting stronger, the sunlight growing more intense.\n[1962-08-15 13:35:00] By the sea | I saw the silhouette of Mount Vesuvius like a chalk drawing, with the usual white pebbles found in cities at its base. I could see the reddish silhouette of Ovo Castle and the sea.\n[1962-08-15 13:36:00] By the sea | I really saw the sea, and it was magnificent! The waves were huge, the sound of the ocean was powerful, the wind was so strong that I could hardly breathe, my clothes clung tightly to my body, and my bangs were blown up by the wind.\n[1962-08-15 13:40:00] By the sea | I saw us standing on the side of the road with a small group of people, looking at the view ahead.\n[1962-08-15 13:41:00] By the sea | I saw the waves spraying up like protein, bursting into countless glittering fragments, tossing them all the way to our feet and causing a wave of astonishment and fear among us.\n[1962-08-15 13:42:00] By the sea | I thought about how it was a real pity that Lina wasn't by my side.\n[1962-08-15 13:43:00] By the sea | I thought of the grand scene before me, the sounds that made me feel dizzy.\n[1962-08-15 13:44:00] By the sea | I thought about how I felt, even though I was immersed in the scene before me and remembered many details, yet so much else unfolded before my eyes, slipping away too quickly for me to catch.\n[1962-08-15 13:45:00] By the sea | I saw my father tightly gripping my hand, as if afraid I would slip away. I thought that, in reality, I really wanted to let go of his hand and run, across the main road, toward the sparkling sea.\n[1962-08-15 13:46:00] By the sea | I saw that in this shocking moment, everywhere was filled with sunlight and the noise of the sea. I thought of myself as pretending to be alone in an unfamiliar city, like a brand-new me facing my own rebirth.\n[1962-08-15 13:47:00] By the sea | I thought of a brand-new life, suddenly emerging from lifeless things—I was sure I could seize this new beginning.\n[1962-08-15 13:48:00] By the sea | I thought of me and Lina, the two of us invincible together—we could only capture those colors and sounds, those people and events when we were together. We could tell stories and give those stories power.\n[1962-08-15 15:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself returning to our Mergellina, as if coming back from very far away.\n[1962-08-15 15:05:00] Mergellina | I saw myself back on the familiar street. I saw Stefano's Capodimonte, and his sister Pinocchia; I saw Enzo selling fruit; I saw the Solara brothers' \"Fiat 1100\" parked in front of the bar.\n[1962-08-15 15:06:00] Mergellina | I thought I would be willing to pay any price to make the Solara brothers disappear from the world.\n[1962-08-15 15:07:00] Mergellina | I was relieved that my mother didn't know about the bracelet, and lucky enough that no one told Rino what had happened that day.\n[1962-08-15 16:00:00] Mergellina | I told Lina about the streets I saw, the names of those streets, the noise of the cars, and the magical lights.\n[1962-08-15 16:05:00] Mergellina | I thought about it, but I quickly felt uncomfortable. If she were me, if she were the one telling about her day's experiences, even though I hadn't been with her, I would have couldn't help but be amazed.\n[1962-08-15 16:06:00] Mergellina | I thought about asking questions, being very active in our conversation, raising doubts. I would try to suggest that I wanted to follow the same route as her, and if there was an opportunity, I would make the trip more exciting. I would become a better companion than her father.\n[1962-08-15 16:07:00] Mergellina | I thought of her, but she was careless. At that moment, I thought, she must have done it on purpose, to extinguish my enthusiasm.\n[1962-08-15 16:08:00] Mergellina | I thought she wanted me to believe that things weren't as I said. She was just lost in her own thoughts, something very specific: a book, or maybe a small fountain.\n[1962-08-15 16:09:00] Mergellina | I saw her ears really listening to what I was saying. I thought of her, but her eyes and mind were closely watching the street.\n[1962-08-15 16:10:00] Mergellina | I saw her looking at the few trees in the small park; Girolama, Alfonso Carracci, and Carmela were walking; Pasquale waved at us from the scaffolding at the construction site.\n[1962-08-15 16:11:00] Mergellina | I saw Melina talking loudly about Donato Nino, and Pinocchia tried to pull her back home; Don Achille's son Stefano had just bought a \"Gallardetta,\" his mother was sitting in the passenger seat, and his sister Pinocchia was sitting in the back.\n[1962-08-15 16:12:00] Mergellina | I saw Marcello and Michele driving their \"Fiat 1100\" past, and Michele pretended not to see us, but Marcello still gave me a friendly glance.\n[1962-08-15 16:13:00] Mergellina | I thought that above all, Lina was thinking about the secret job she had done behind her father's back, and she was thinking about how to move forward with the plan for the shoes.\n[1962-08-15 16:14:00] Mergellina | I thought about the story I told, which for her was just useless signals in useless spaces. Those places, she would only consider if she had the chance to go there.\n[1962-08-15 16:15:00] Mergellina | I saw that, in reality, after hearing my story, she only said. \"I heard, 'I'm going to tell Rino that we'll accept Pasquale Peruzzo's invitation for Sunday.'\"\n[1962-08-15 16:16:00] Mergellina | I thought that's how it was. I told her about the events in the city center, and she took Girolama's house as the topic of our conversation—that was one of the houses in our Mergellina, and Pasquale wanted to take us dancing there.\n[1962-08-15 16:17:00] Mergellina | I thought it was a pity, because every time Peruzzo invited us, Lina and I said we'd go, but we never actually did.\n[1962-08-15 16:18:00] Mergellina | I didn't go to avoid unnecessary arguments with my parents; Lina didn't go because Rino opposed it.\n[1962-08-15 16:19:00] Mergellina | I see, but sometimes we pay close attention to Pasquale, who is neatly dressed and waiting for his various friends, big and small, during the ball.\n[1962-08-15 16:20:00] Mergellina | I know he's a very generous young man, treating people of all ages equally and willing to welcome everyone.\n[1962-08-15 16:21:00] Mergellina | I saw him usually waiting at the gas station, and at that time his friends would come over one by one: Enzo, Gigliola, and Camilla—now she wanted everyone to call her \"Pinocchia.\" Rino would also show up sometimes.\n[1962-08-15 16:22:00] Mergellina | I know Antonio is taking care of Melina; he also appears when she's calmer, and there's his sister Pinocchia— the Solara brothers would drag her into the car and spend an hour somewhere misbehaving, and sometimes she goes off with them.\n[1962-08-15 16:23:00] Mergellina | When the weather was good, they and their friends would go to the beach, and come back with sunburned faces.",

In their house, whoever can dance does so, and those who can't learn.\n[1962-08-15 16:25:00] Small Park | \"I God! Look what you've done!\" I shouted, and at that moment, Lina suddenly came over—she pushed Marcello into the car and pressed a leather-cutting knife against his throat. \"I'm not in a hurry,\" he said as he opened the car door and got out, \"Now I'll fix it for you.\"\n[1962-08-15 16:26:00] Small Park | I saw her speaking in a slow, unhurried way in her dialect. I heard, \"If you dare touch her again, you'll see what happens.\"\n[1962-08-15 16:27:00] Small Park | I saw from my angle that the knife had already cut into Marcello's skin, creating a small wound that oozed a thread of blood. I remember clearly what happened; at that moment, her attitude was very clear: she would have no hesitation in cutting Marcello's throat.\n[1962-08-15 16:30:00] Small Park | I saw Michele return to the car, and Lina slowly lowered the blade from Marcello's neck. I heard, \"Come on! Marcello, apologize to the two ladies, we're leaving.\"\n[1962-08-15 16:32:00] Small Park | I saw him kneeling in front of me on the sidewalk, reaching under the car, finding the bracelet, fixing it, and handing it back to me, but his eyes were on Lina. I heard him say, \"I'm sorry.\"\n[1962-08-20 09:00:00] By the sea | I remember one morning when my father took me out, and we walked together toward the seaside avenue. I saw the wind growing stronger, the sunlight more intense. The silhouette of Mount Vesuvius looked like a chalk drawing. At the foot of the volcano, there were the usual white pebbles found in cities. I could see the reddish silhouette of Ovo Castle and the sea.\n[1962-08-20 09:10:00] By the sea | I really saw the sea, and it was magnificent! The waves were huge, the sound of the ocean was powerful, and the wind was so strong that it made it hard to breathe. I thought about Lina not being by my side, and it was truly a regret. This grand scene, this sound made me feel dizzy.\n[1962-08-20 09:20:00] By the sea | I thought that in this shocking moment, the place was filled with sunlight and the noise of the sea, and I pretended to be a person alone in an unfamiliar city, like a new me facing my own rebirth.\n[1962-08-20 12:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself returning to our Mergellina, as if coming back from very far away, and I told Lina about the streets I had seen, the names of those streets, the noise of the cars, and the magical lights. I thought about it, but I soon felt uncomfortable. She, however, was careless. At that moment, I thought, she must have done it on purpose, to extinguish my enthusiasm.\n[1962-08-20 12:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that, after hearing my story, she just said. I heard, \"I'm going to tell Rino that we'll accept Pasquale Peluso's invitation on Sunday.\"\n[1962-08-20 19:00:00] Elena's House | I saw Lina start dragging me to these family gatherings, for some reason, she suddenly seemed interested in dancing.\n[1962-08-20 19:10:00] Elena's house | I saw how we learned the tango, waltz, polka, and mazurka from them. I thought and I was surprised to discover that both Pasquale and Rino were excellent dance partners.\n[1962-08-20 19:15:00] Elena's house | I know, as a dance teacher, Rino can easily lose his patience, especially with his sister, while Pasquale is very patient. He started by having me step on his feet to learn the steps.\n[1962-08-20 19:20:00] Elena's house | I saw that when we learned a little, we would spin around in the house.\n[1962-08-20 19:25:00] Elena's House | I thought about how we both like to dance, and I wanted to keep dancing forever.\n[1962-08-20 19:30:00] Elena's House | I saw Lina still wearing that determined expression, as if her pleasure came from the process of learning.\n[1962-08-20 19:35:00] Elena's House | I saw, really, she usually sat there watching, studying our dance steps, and clapping for those who danced most beautifully.\n[1962-08-20T20:00:00] Posillipo | I knew that time was passing day by day, and I felt my life becoming increasingly meaningless. This feeling kept growing and finally erupted after August fifteenth. I feel very depressed. I have to get up very early every day, run to Via Mezzocannone, work busily all day there, and come home completely exhausted. My mind is full of thousands of sentences I've learned at school, but I never have the chance to show them off.\n[1962-08-20T21:00:00] Posillipo | I think about it now, and the only one who truly loved me was Antonio. There will never be anyone else who loves me like he did. Lying in bed at night, I can't help but recall the scent of his skin, our secret meetings by the pond, and our whispered moments in the abandoned canning factory.\n[1962-08-25 15:00:00] Lina's house | I remember once when I went to her house, she showed me a book she had borrowed from the library. I know it's described in detail on the page, with diagrams—an black-and-white illustration of a man and a woman spinning together.\n[1962-08-25 15:05:00] Lina's house | I knew that during that time, she was in a very good mood. I thought that for her, it was a period of rich and varied life.\n[1962-08-25 15:10:00] Lina's house | Sometimes she would suddenly wrap her arms around my waist and pull me into a tango, humming the tune with her mouth.\n[1962-08-25 15:15:00] Lina's house | I saw Rino sometimes stick his head in, and when he saw us he would laugh. He also wanted to dance, first with me, then with his sister, even though we had no music.\n[1962-08-25 15:20:00] Lina's house | I saw you dancing with Rino, he told me. I heard that Lina is now obsessively pursuing perfection, always forcing him to practice with her, even though they don't have a phonograph. As soon as Lina hears the word, she starts shouting, \"Phonograph! Phonograph! Phonograph!\"\n[1962-08-25 15:21:00] Lina's house | I saw her in the corner of the room, squinting as she said. I heard, \"Do you know where this word comes from?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1962-08-25 15:22:00] Lina's house | I saw myself looking at her with a puzzled expression. I heard \"It's Greek.\"\n[1962-08-25 15:23:00] Lina's house | I saw that at this moment Rino let go of me and started dancing with his sister. She gave a soft cry of joy, shoved a book on dancing into my hands, and then began to dance gracefully with Rino in the room.\n[1962-08-25 15:24:00] Lina's house | I saw myself placing the dance book on top of a pile of books. I thought about what she had just said. \"Gramophone\" is Italian, isn't it? Not Greek.\n[1962-08-25 15:25:00] Lina's house | I saw it then, a copy of \"War and Peace\" with Professor Ferraro's library stamp on it. I saw another very worn book emerge from the pile of books, its title was \"Greek Grammar.\"\n[1962-08-25 15:26:00] Lina's house | I thought about grammar, Greek grammar.\n[1962-08-25 15:27:00] Lina's house | I saw and heard her panting as she spoke to me. I heard, \"Later, I'll write 'gramophone' for you using Greek letters.\"\n[1962-08-25 15:30:00] Lina's house | I said I had something to do and left.\n[1962-08-25 18:00:00] Elena's House | I saw Lina start dragging me to these family gatherings, and I was surprised to find that Pasquale and Rino were excellent dance partners. We learned the tango, waltz, polka, and mazurka from them.\n[1962-08-26 15:00:00] Lina's house | I remember once when I went to her house, she showed me a book she had borrowed from the library. While we were dancing, Rino told me that Lina was now obsessively pursuing perfection. Lina, in the corner of the room, squinted her eyes and said. I heard, \"Do you know where the word 'gramophone' comes from? It's from Greek.\"\n[1962-08-26 15:05:00] Lina's house | I saw myself placing the dance book on top of a pile of books. I saw a copy of \"War and Peace\" and another very worn book popped out from the pile, titled \"Greek Grammar.\"",

I never even considered that possibility.\n[1962-09-01 10:10:00] Home | I thought about how I had spent all my time following her, only to find out in the end that it was actually she who was following me. Whether I was following her or she was following me, I always felt inferior to her.\n[1962-09-01T20:00:00] Small Garden | One evening after dinner, Pinocchia, Pinocchia, and Pasquale came to see me. We bought ice cream and ate it in the small garden. Pinocchia was blunt and direct, asking me why I had never gone to Capodimonte again. I heard myself say that I worked on Via Mezzocannone and that I didn't have time now.\n[1962-09-01T20:05:00] Small Garden | I heard Pinocchia coldly say, \"If you really care about someone, you always find the time. But that's just who I am—no explanations needed.\"  \nI asked, \"What kind of person am I?\" She replied, \"You're heartless. Just look at how you treated my brother.\"  \nI suddenly got very emotional and reminded her that it was her brother who left me. She answered, \"If you believe that, you can rest easy. Someone ends a relationship, and someone else makes another person leave her.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:06:00] Small Garden | I heard Pinocchia also chiming in agreement: \"It's the same with friendship.\" She said, \"On the surface, it seems that friendship ends because of one person's mistake, but if you think about it yourself, the fault lies with the other person.\"  \nAt this, I became even more excited, speaking slowly and clearly: \"Listen, if me and Lina aren't as close anymore, it's not my fault.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:07:00] Small Garden | I heard Pasquale interject at this point, saying, \"Elena, whether someone is right or wrong doesn't matter, but what matters is that we stand by Lina's side.\" I know he mentioned his own experience of having a tooth pulled, and how Lina helped him at that time. He also talked about the money she secretly gave to Pinocchia, and the money she gave to Antonio when he joined the army.\n[1962-09-01T20:08:00] Small Garden | I heard it and still asked carefully, \"What's wrong with Antonio?\" They all spoke at once, their tones were different, saying his mind had already broken down once and he was in a bad way now, but he was a tough guy and would surely make it. I know that, even though I don't know and don't want to know, Antonio's situation in the army is bad.\n[1962-09-01T20:09:00] Small Garden | I heard, \"What's wrong with Lina?\"  \n\"They took her to see a doctor.\"  \n\"Who is taking her to see a doctor?\"  \n\"Stefano, Pinocchia, and other relatives.\"  \n\"Why?\"  \n\"To find out why she only had one child and couldn't have any more after that.\"  \n\"What about her?\"  \n\"She pretended to be crazy and didn't want to go to the hospital.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:00] Small Garden | I saw myself shrugging my shoulders. I heard \"What can I do now?\"  \nPinocchio said, \"Take her with you.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:05] Small Garden | I ended up going to see Lina and talking to her. I heard her laugh and say that if I swore I wasn't angry with her, she would go to the doctor.\n[1962-09-01T20:10:10] Small Garden | I heard \"Okay.\"\n\"You swear it.\"\n\"I swear it.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:15] Small Garden | I said that whether she went to see a doctor was none of my business; if she wanted to, she could, if not, it was fine too. I heard, \"You must swear by the lives of your brothers, or by Elisa's life.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:20] Small Garden | I heard, \"So you don't want to take the oath then.\"  \n\"No.\" I saw her become very serious.\n[1962-09-01T20:10:25] Small Garden | I saw her fall silent for a moment, then lower her eyes. I heard, \"Well, I was wrong.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:30] Small Garden | I saw myself making an impatient expression. I heard, \"You go see the doctor and then tell me the result.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:35] Small Garden | I heard, \"You're not coming with me?\"  \n\"If I don't go to work at the bookstore, I'll be fired.\"\n[1962-09-01T20:10:40] Small Garden | I saw her speak to me in a mocking tone. \"I could hire you,\" I heard.  \n\"Go see a doctor, Lina.\"\n[1962-09-02T10:00:00] Courtyard | I know she went to see the doctor with Maria, Nunzia, and Pinocchia, and all three were present when the doctor examined her.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:05] Courtyard | I knew Lina was very obedient and submissive; she had never before undergone such an examination. Throughout the process, she kept her lips tightly closed and her eyes wide open.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:10] Courtyard | I heard that only Pinocchia was very unhappy, so I asked, \"Then why can't she get pregnant, and even if she does, she can't keep the baby?\" I knew that when the doctor—the elderly physician recommended by the gynecologist—spoke in some very sophisticated words, saying everything was fine, my mother-in-law and my mother both turned from worried to relieved.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:15] Courtyard | I saw the doctor notice her displeasure and he frowned. I heard him say, \"This lady is still too young.\" He added, \"She needs to build up her strength.\"\n[1962-09-02T10:00:20] Courtyard | I saw when Lina told me the result. I thought about strengthening my body—I didn't know if the doctor used that exact expression, but I was shocked.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:25] Courtyard | I thought that meant, even though Lina always acted so strong, she was actually very fragile.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:30] Courtyard | I thought that meant she couldn't get pregnant, or if she did, she wouldn't be able to keep the baby. It wasn't because she had some magical ability to prevent herself from becoming pregnant. On the contrary, she was a weak woman.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:35] Courtyard | I saw us in the courtyard at that time, and she told me about the \"torture\" she had endured at the doctor's. She described the doctor and the three people who had accompanied her with vulgar language. I thought about hearing these things, and my anger gradually faded away.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:40] Courtyard | I didn't show impatience; on the contrary, I was very interested in what she was saying. I knew because I hadn't seen a doctor, let alone a gynecologist.\n[1962-09-02T10:00:45] Courtyard | I saw her end with a very sharp conclusion. I heard him say, \"He stuck some metal thing inside my body, it hurt like tearing apart. I spent a lot of money just to get this conclusion? I need to build up my strength?\"\n[1962-09-02T10:00:50] Courtyard | I heard, \"What do I need to do to build up my physical strength?\"  \n\"I'm going swimming at the beach.\"  \n\"I don't understand.\"\n[1962-09-02T10:00:55] Courtyard | I saw that we said our cheerful goodbyes, and later we met again. I heard, \"Beach, sun, and sea. Elena! It seems that if a woman goes to the seaside, her body becomes stronger and she can have children.\"\n[1962-09-03T09:00:00] Bookstore | I saw her again the next day, very warm toward me, but impatient with her husband. I thought that overall, our time together had been fairly pleasant.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:05] Bookstore | I knew Stefano wanted to rent a house by the sea in Torre Annona, so that Lina, Nunzia, and Pinocchia could stay there all through July and August.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:10] Bookstore | I know that Pinocchia also wants to build up her strength, even though she doesn't need to. They've already started considering how to arrange the store's affairs.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:15] Bookstore | I knew that until the start of the term, Alfonso Carracci would manage the store at Piazza Martiri with Giggia, and Maria would take Lina's place at the new Capodimonte.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:20] Bookstore | I saw Lina looking dejected as she spoke to me. \"I heard, 'If I stayed with my mother and Pinocchio for two months, I would [tragic event].'”\n[1962-09-03T09:00:25] Bookstore | \"I heard, 'But you can swim, you can sunbathe.'\"\n\"I don't like swimming, and I don't like sunbathing.\"\n\"If I could build up my strength like you, I'd go tomorrow without hesitation.\"\n[1962-09-03T09:00:30] Bookstore | I saw her looking at me with a face full of curiosity, speaking slowly. \"I heard, 'Then you come with me.'  \n'I have to go to work on Via Maestra Cappuccina.'\"\n[1962-09-03T09:00:35] Bookstore | I saw her become very enthusiastic, and she said she would hire me, not in jest, and she began to pressure me. I heard, \"You quit! Whatever amount the bookstore owner gives you, I'll give you the same.\"\n[1962-09-03T09:00:40] Bookstore | I saw that she kept insisting, saying that if I agreed to go, everything would become bearable, even including Pinocchio. I know that Pinocchia is now heavily pregnant, and her condition is clearly visible.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:45] Bookstore | I saw that I had politely declined her invitation. I could imagine what would happen during those two months, in that house by the sea: she would argue with Nunzia, she would cry.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:50] Bookstore | I thought that when Stefano arrived there on Saturday night, they would also quarrel, she would argue with Rino, because Rino would come with his brother-in-law to reunite with Pinocchia.\n[1962-09-03T09:00:55] Bookstore | I said at the end, very firmly. I heard, \"I can't go! My mother won't let me.\" I thought especially about how she would fight with Pinocchia, constantly arguing, whether it was a small conflict or a loud outburst, they would say very cruel and disgusting words.\n[1962-09-03T09:01:00] Bookstore | I saw her walk away angrily. I think about the beautiful moments between us, which were very short.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:00] Bookstore | I saw Nino appear in the bookstore. What surprised me was that I saw his face pale and his whole body very thin.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:05] Bookstore | I know that during these days, he took one exam after another, four subjects in total. I thought about how I had imagined all sorts of things happening in the ivory tower of the university. I believed it was filled with exceptionally outstanding students and wise professors who spent their days discussing Plato and Kepler.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:10] Bookstore | I saw myself completely absorbed in listening to him. I heard myself just say, \"You're really good at it.\"\n[1962-09-04T09:00:15] Bookstore | As soon as there was a chance to speak, I praised his article published in Southern News with a lot of vague and empty words.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:20] Bookstore | I saw him listening seriously to me without interrupting once. I thought to myself that in the end, I didn't know what else to say to prove to him how familiar I was with the article.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:25] Bookstore | I saw that he looked happy. I heard him sigh, saying that even Galiani, Nadia, and even Nadia herself hadn't read the article that carefully.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:30] Bookstore | I saw him start to tell me about the article he was working on regarding this subject, and he hoped to publish those articles.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:35] Bookstore | I saw myself standing at the bookstore threshold, listening to him speak, pretending not to hear the bookstore owner calling me. I heard the bookstore owner's cry growing louder.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:40] Bookstore | I saw him with that very indifferent expression and stayed a little longer. I heard Nino mutter, \"What does that bastard want?\"\n[1962-09-04T09:00:45] Bookstore | I saw him reaching out a hand to me. I heard him say that he would leave for Vomero in a few days.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:50] Bookstore | I saw myself shaking his hand. I saw and felt his hands were delicate, with soft skin.\n[1962-09-04T09:00:55] Bookstore | I saw him quickly pull me to him, lower his head and gently kiss my lips.\n[1962-09-04T09:01:00] Bookstore | I saw it in an instant—he touched my lips with his finger, then walked toward the Rettifilo district.\n[1962-09-04T09:01:05] Bookstore | I saw myself standing there watching him leave, never turning my head. I saw him walking, like a carefree army commander, fearless toward everything in the world, as if the entire world had to pay him respect.\n[1962-09-05T07:00:00] New Capodimonte | I hadn't closed my eyes all night. Early the next morning, I got up very early and ran to the new Capodimonte.\n[1962-09-05T07:05:00] New Capodimonte | I saw Lina pulling open the roller shutter to start the day's business. I saw that Pinocchio had not arrived yet.\n[1962-09-05T07:05:05] New Capodimonte | I said it in a tone that I knew was impossible, but I still had to say it. \"I heard, 'If you go to Vomero instead of going to Torre Annunziata, I'll quit my job and go with you.'\" I thought about the fact that I hadn't told her about Nino.",

    "text": "[1962-09-10 18:00:00] Elena's House | I remember once seeing Lina and her brother dance a waltz, and I was completely enchanted. I saw them dancing so well that everyone else made space for them to dance. I thought of how, when I looked at them, I immediately understood: in a short time, the old-maidish aura surrounding Lina would disappear, she would become like a harmonious piece of music, completely drawing one's emotions into it.\n[1962-09-10 18:10:00] Elena's House | I noticed that while Lina and Rino were dancing, all the boys were staring at her. I saw, especially Pasquale, Antonio, and Enzo, staring intently at Lina, as if the other girls had vanished.\n[1962-09-15 19:00:00] Pizza Shop in Rettifilo District | That night, we arrived at the pizzeria in the Rettifilo district, happily eating pizza.\n[1962-09-15 19:30:00] Pizza Place in Rettifilo District | I saw the pizza maker secretly give Lina a kiss, and Pasquale laughed. I heard, \"That man, the pizza maker, is just an old man to you girls.\"\n[1962-09-15 19:35:00] Pizza Place in Rettifilo District | I saw Pasquale stand up, he walked over to the pizza oven and slapped the pizza maker, knocking him face-first into the mouth of the oven. I saw a pale smile on her lips.\n[1962-09-15 19:40:00] Pizza Place in Rettifilo District | I watched us silently finish the pizza, our eyes drooping, eating very slowly, as if the pizza were poisonous.\n[1962-09-20 15:00:00] Bar | I saw it on an afternoon in late August. We had walked all the way to the city hall. A man sitting across from us approached Lina and, with great politeness, spoke to a few young men. I heard, \"You're really lucky, this girl will be even more beautiful than the Venus in Botticelli's painting.\"\n[1962-09-20 15:05:00] Bar | I saw him about to return to his seat when Rino suddenly grabbed him by the collar, shoved him into his own seat, and forced him down, cursing a string of filthy words from our Mergellina in front of his wife and several sons.\n[1962-10-01 08:00:00] High School | I know our class has forty-two students, one of the few mixed-gender classes in that school. I thought that the first two years of high school were even more exhausting than middle school.\n[1962-10-01 08:05:00] High School | I know very few girls, I don't know any of them personally.\n[1962-10-01 08:10:00] Capodimonte | I knew that after Giacinta had made a lot of big talk (\"Yes, I'm also going to high school, and I'll be your seatmate\"), she ended up dropping out of middle school and went to work at the Solara bar for her father.\n[1962-10-01 08:15:00] High School | I saw the boys, and I recognized Alfonso Carracci and Gino. I saw them sitting at a table near the front, their elbows touching, looking scared, both pretending they didn't know me.\n[1962-10-01 08:20:00] High School | I saw and smelled the classroom, which was stinky with the smell of sweat, smelly feet, and the air of worry.\n[1962-10-01 19:00:00] Elena's House | I saw that Giyao's mother had a party at home on her birthday. I saw that many delicious pastries had been prepared, and the music for dancing was also varied, ranging from the most common dance tunes to the most popular ones.\n[1962-10-01 19:30:00] Elena's House | I saw that they first played a traditional dance tune, and then switched to a trendy rock song. I saw everyone—old and young alike—filled with curiosity about rock music.\n[1962-10-01 20:00:00] Elena's House | I saw when another rock song was played, Enzo caught Lina's arm and naturally pushed her into the dance floor. I saw that Enzo really wasn't very good at dancing; his body didn't move well, and he was very serious and stiff, but he cared a lot about Lina.\n[1962-10-01 20:10:00] Elena's House | I saw when Lina was dancing, the Solara brothers arrived, and they finally noticed Lina, staring at her for a long time. I saw Marcello staring at Lina the whole time, as if he'd lost even the little bit of sense he had, gazing at her until the music ended.\n[1962-10-01 20:20:00] Elena's House | I saw Michele elbow Stefano and shout something at him. \"I heard, 'Are you even a man? That person is the son of your father's killer, or just a despicable Communist Party. He stole your dance partner, and you're just standing here watching him dance with that girl?'\"\n[1962-10-01 20:25:00] Elena's House | I saw Stefano looking at Michele with a flattering smile, saying. I heard, \"Let them dance, he dances well.\"\n[1962-10-01 20:30:00] Elena's house | After the dance ended, Girolama politely took Pasquale by the arm and led him to a corner, where she said something in his ear. Michele laughed and said something to his older brother. I heard, \"Go, the path has been cleared.\"\n[1962-10-01 20:35:00] Elena's House | I saw the music start again, and Lina grabbed Marcello's hand. She was drenched in sweat, and she began once more with the thing that had always been most important to her: dancing. I thought I was sure that Lina would refuse him, but that's not how it turned out.\n[1962-10-01 20:45:00] Elena's House | I saw the music end, and Lina came toward me. I said to her. I heard, \"Something's going to happen. We should leave.\"\n[1962-10-01 20:46:00] Elena's House | I saw her smile and said loudly. I heard, \"Even if there was an earthquake, I would dance one more.\"\n[1962-10-01 20:55:00] Elena's House | I saw the music start again, and Marcello grabbed Lina's arm, smiling as he begged her. I heard, \"Don't go, I'll take you home.\"\n[1962-10-01 20:56:00] Elena's house | I saw her trying to shake off Marcello's hand, but he held on tighter. He said. I heard, \"One more dance, please.\"\n[1962-10-01 20:57:00] Elena's house | I saw that, and at that moment Enzo came over from the wall, he grabbed Marcello's wrist, and said nothing.\n[1962-10-01 20:58:00] Elena's House | I saw Marcello release Lina's arm, his face showing pain, and immediately grabbed his wrist with his other hand. I saw Enzo standing right in front of me, calm, short in stature, and still young, as if it took him no effort at all, but the strength of his arms was only visible on Marcello's face.\n[1962-10-01 20:59:00] Elena's House | I saw and heard Lina was furious, biting her teeth and speaking in dialect to Enzo. I heard, \"He dared to touch me, did you see? Touch me? That piece of dog excrement! Lucky Rino wasn't here. If he comes again, his time has come.\"\n[1962-10-01 21:00:00] Outside Elena's house | I saw us run into Pasquale, Antonio, Carmela, and Pinocchia outside. Pasquale was furious, cursing wildly, shouting with a voice that seemed to tear his throat apart.\n[1962-10-01 21:05:00] Outside Elena's house | I saw him shouting loudly. I heard, \"Dad killed him, he killed well. Now it's the Solara family's turn, I'll kill them. In the end, I'll also make Stefano and his whole family disappear from this earth.\"\n[1962-10-01 21:06:00] Outside Elena's house | I saw him pointing at Lina, as if she had committed the worst crime, he said. I heard, \"You, you actually danced with him, you're really shameless!\"\n[1962-10-01 21:10:00] Outside Elena's house | I saw Pinocchio immediately start crying, and finally Camilla also couldn't hold back her tears. Enzo tried to persuade everyone not to stay on the road. I heard, \"Let's go home and get some sleep.\"\n[1962-10-01 21:15:00] Elena's house outside | I started crying too, and after a while, Lina began to cry as well. The thing that moved me the most was - I had never seen her cry, never once.\n[1962-10-01 21:20:00] Outside Jiyao's house | I saw that Pasquale had seen Lina crying, and that's when he softened. He spoke in a compliant tone. I heard, \"Okay, we won't do anything tonight. We'll settle with the Solara brothers another time. Let's go...\"\n[1962-10-01 21:25:00] Outside Elena's house | I saw Lina finally wipe her tears with the back of her hand and ask. \"I heard 'What is the Nazi Fascist? Pascal! What is the royalist? What is the black market?'\"\n[1962-10-01 21:30:00] Street | I found it hard to describe the effect Pasquale's answer had on Lina; she was completely transformed by the impact of the event.",

    "text": "[1962-10-05 15:00:00] Street | I saw her pointing at people, things, and the street, and then she would say. I heard, \"This man took part in the war, he's killed people; that one hit people with a stick and put castor oil on them; that one turned in a lot of people; that one let his mother starve; they tortured people in that house, they killed people; they walked over that stone, did the Fascist ritual.\"\n[1962-10-10 16:00:00] Street | I saw her becoming more and more feverish and troubled, mixing Pasquale's dry messages with the books she had borrowed from the library. I thought that perhaps she urgently needed to lock herself inside a solid idea, with no cracks whatsoever.\n[1962-10-10 16:10:00] Street | I saw her transform those concepts into streets, houses, and people's faces. I thought that in her eyes, her father, the cobbler Fernando, and my father were all stained with various sins from the depths of their bones; everyone was a criminal burdened with heavy sins, or an accomplice, and everyone could be bought for a few small coins.\n[1962-10-10 16:20:00] Street | I thought about how she and Pasquale had locked me into a terrible world with no way out.\n[1962-10-15 09:00:00] High School | In the first few months of high school, I remained silent and didn't speak to anyone. My hands were always on my forehead or my chin. I always see pimples emerging endlessly in these two places.\n[1962-10-15 09:05:00] High School | I saw myself sitting in the back row of the classroom, barely able to see the teacher, and the words on the blackboard. I know that I don't even know my seatmate.\n[1962-10-15 09:10:00] High School | I knew that Teacher Oliviero had managed to get me the books I needed, even though they were dirty and worn, they would work.\n[1962-10-15 17:00:00] Street | By the end, Pasquale stopped speaking. I often saw them walking together; where once he had spoken, now he was the one listening to her. I thought he was also defeated by Lina's ability to connect everything.\n[1962-10-15 17:10:00] Street | I thought he had fallen for Lina. I thought Lina would fall for him too, and they would get engaged, get married, and keep talking about those political issues forever.\n[1962-10-15 17:20:00] Street | I thought about the start of the school term. On one hand, I felt very sad because I knew I would never have time to be with Lina again; on the other hand, I wanted to get out of that world, that world full of crimes.\n[1962-10-20 05:00:00] Home | I forced myself using the method I learned in middle school: studying from afternoon until 11 p.m., and from five a.m. to seven a.m., then going to school.\n[1962-10-20 07:00:00] Street | I often met Lina when I left home carrying my backpack; she was also running to the shop, getting ready to open it and clean and wash it.\n[1962-10-20 07:05:00] Street | I knew that before her father and brother went to work, she had to clean the shop thoroughly.\n[1962-10-20 07:10:00] Street | I asked her what class she had that day, what she had learned, and she wanted me to answer in detail. If my answer wasn't detailed enough, she would ask me a series of questions.\n[1962-10-20 07:15:00] Street | I felt anxious thinking about it, convinced that I hadn't studied well enough to answer the teacher's question, just like I couldn't answer her question.\n[1962-11-01 05:00:00] Home | I saw that on a cold morning, I got up before dawn and reviewed my lessons in the kitchen.\n[1962-11-01 05:05:00] Home | I thought, as usual, I felt I had sacrificed the warm, cozy bed and my sleep—not to show off in front of the teachers at that rich school, but to avoid embarrassment in front of the cobbler's daughter.\n[1962-11-01 06:50:00] Home | I had rushed through my breakfast because of her, downing my milk and coffee in one go before heading out onto the main road. I thought about not wanting to miss even a single meter of the path we walked together.\n[1962-11-01 07:00:00] Main Gate | I saw myself waiting at the gate, watching her come out of the building where she lived.\n[1962-11-01 07:01:00] Main Gate | I saw her constantly changing—she was now a bit taller than me, and the way she walked was no longer that of the bony little girl from a few months ago. Her body had become rounder, as if her steps had also grown softer.\n[1962-11-01 07:02:00] Street | I said hello, and we started talking right away. I heard \"Hi! Hi!\"\n[1962-11-01 07:15:00] Crossroads | I saw that we would part ways at the crossroads; she went toward the shoemaker's shop, and I headed for the subway station.\n[1962-11-01 07:16:00] Crossroads | I saw myself turning back again and again, stealing one last look at her.\n[1962-11-01 07:17:00] Crossroads | I saw him run over, out of breath, a couple of times, accompanying her along that stretch of road.\n[1962-11-01 07:30:00] Subway | I saw the subway crowded with dirty boys and girls, drowsy and still half-awake, and the first cigarette of the morning people were smoking.\n[1962-11-01 07:35:00] Subway | I saw that I didn't smoke and didn't speak to anyone.\n[1962-11-01 07:40:00] Subway | I saw, in those few minutes, how I had reviewed the lessons in my mind. I thought about my anxious state, the foreign languages that were wildly popping into my mind, completely different from our common language Mergellina.\n[1962-11-01 07:45:00] Subway | I thought about what I feared most: academic failure, my mother's disappointment, her limp figure, and Professor Oliviero's scornful look.\n[1962-11-01 07:46:00] Subway | I realized that at the time, my only real thought was: I had to find a boyfriend right away, before Lina announced she was with Pasquale.\n[1962-11-01 07:47:00] Subway | I felt the sense of urgency growing stronger and stronger.\n[1962-11-01 14:00:00] Street | I thought about how scared I was to go back to school, I was afraid of meeting her.\n[1962-11-01 14:01:00] Street | I thought about how she might tell me, with a voice full of joy, that she had slept with Pasquale Peluso; or not Pasquale, but Enzo; or not Enzo, but Antonio; or maybe even Stefano Carracci, the owner of Capodimonte; or even Marcello.\n[1962-11-01 14:02:00] Street | I thought about Lina, how she was always capricious and unpredictable, and how all the men around her had grown up, each full of expectations for her.\n[1962-11-01 14:03:00] Street | I thought the end result might be that, busy with her shoes and focused on studying the history of this terrible world we live in, plus having boyfriends, she wouldn't have time for me anymore.\n[1962-11-01 14:10:00] Street | I sometimes took a long way home from school, avoiding their shop altogether.\n[1962-11-01 14:15:00] Street | If I saw her from a distance, I would change my route out of anxiety; but later, I could no longer resist and walked toward her. I thought it was as if it were destined.\n[1962-11-02 08:00:00] High School | I saw our school was a very dilapidated gray building.\n[1962-11-02 08:05:00] High School | I watch the boys coming and going at school, staring at them intently. I wanted them to feel my gaze, wanted them to see me too.\n[1962-11-02 08:10:00] High School | I saw my classmates of the same age, some wearing shorts, some in wide-top narrow-bottom military pants, and others in long pants.\n[1962-11-02 08:15:00] High School | I watched the upperclassmen, most of them were dressed in suits and ties, but few wore coats. I saw them with short haircuts, their bare necks exposed. I thought they were trying to be cool, showing they weren't afraid of the cold at all.\n[1962-11-02 08:16:00] High School | I thought I preferred older boys, but now having a boyfriend who's a freshman is also good. The important thing is that he should be a boy who wears pants.\n[1962-11-05 08:30:00] High School | I saw one day that a boy caught my attention. I saw how he walked in a lazy way. He was thin, with curly chestnut hair and a handsome face. I thought to myself that I felt very familiar.\n[1962-11-05 08:31:00] High School | I wondered how old he was? Sixteen? Seventeen?\n[1962-11-05 08:32:00] High School | I looked at him carefully, then went back to look at him again. My heart was about to jump out of my chest—it was Nino, Nino! He was Donato Nino, the son of a railway worker and a poet!\n[1962-11-05 08:33:00] High School | I saw him looking at me. I thought of him, but he seemed indifferent and didn't recognize me.\n[1962-11-05 08:34:00] High School | I saw his coat sleeves were wrinkled, his shoulders narrow, his pants old and worn, and his shoes dirty and messy.\n[1962-11-05 08:35:00] High School | I thought he didn't look rich at all, not like Stefano who showed off, especially not like the Solara brothers. Although his father had written a poetry collection, it was obvious they weren't wealthy yet.\n[1962-11-05 08:40:00] High School | I felt very uneasy at Nino's sudden appearance.",

I thought about it, but then I changed my mind.\n[1962-11-05 13:05:00] Street | I thought that if I told her, she would definitely ask me to go to school with her to see him.\n[1962-11-05 13:06:00] Street | I thought I already knew what was going to happen. Nino hadn't noticed me at all—the thin, blonde little girl from elementary school had now become a fat, fourteen-year-old with acne all over his face—and he didn't recognize me.\n[1962-11-05 13:07:00] Street | I thought that he would immediately recognize Lina and be conquered by her.\n[1962-11-05 13:10:00] Street | I decided to keep the encounter with Nino to myself.\n[1962-11-05 13:15:00] Street | I saw him leave the school with his head down, swaying as he walked toward Garibaldi Road.\n[1962-11-05 13:16:00] Street | I thought that since that day, the reason I went to school was just to see him, or at least to see him from a distance.\n[1962-11-30 08:00:00] High School | I know that autumn also speeds away.\n[1962-12-01 09:00:00] High School | I remember one morning, I was asked a question about the Aeneid. I knew that was the first time I had been called to the podium.\n[1962-12-01 09:05:00] High School | I saw that the teacher, Gerace, was a man in his sixties. He seemed somewhat annoyed, always yawning loudly.\n[1962-12-01 09:10:00] High School | I noticed I had mispronounced the word \"oracle\" and he immediately laughed.\n[1962-12-01 09:11:00] High School | I thought he could never imagine it, although I knew the meaning of the word, no one in the world I lived in would ever use it.\n[1962-12-01 09:12:00] High School | I saw everyone laughing, especially Gino, who was sitting in the front row with Alfonso Carracci. I thought I felt ashamed.\n[1962-12-05 09:00:00] High School | I had seen it a few days before, and we took our first Latin exam.\n[1962-12-05 09:05:00] High School | I saw Teacher Girace bring the corrected exams into the classroom and ask. I heard, \"Who is Greco?\"\n[1962-12-05 09:06:00] High School | I saw myself raising my hand. I heard, \"Come here.\"\n[1962-12-05 09:10:00] High School | I saw him asking me a lot of questions about verb endings, verbs, and syntax.\n[1962-12-05 09:15:00] High School | I saw myself answering the questions in a state of terror. I thought, because he was looking at me so carefully, he had never paid attention to anyone in the class before.\n[1962-12-05 09:20:00] High School | I saw that in the end he didn't make any comments, just handed me the exam paper. I got nine points.\n[1962-12-10 09:00:00] High School | I thought that from that moment on, my status had been elevated.\n[1962-12-10 09:05:00] High School | I know I got eight in my Italian exam, didn't make a single mistake in the history test, and for geography—I knew all the areas, populations, underground resources, and agriculture.\n[1962-12-10 09:10:00] High School | I thought of my Greek grades, which especially astonished him.\n[1962-12-10 09:15:00] High School | I saw that I could read fluently, and my tone and intonation were also natural. I finally received my teacher's public praise. I already knew those Greek letters because I had studied them with Lina beforehand.\n[1962-12-10 09:20:00] High School | I thought of my outstanding grades as a theorem, and they also shocked the other teachers.\n[1962-12-12 09:00:00] High School | One day morning, the religion teacher called me aside and asked if I was willing to enroll in a free theology correspondence course. I heard myself say yes.\n[1962-12-20 09:00:00] High School | When Christmas approached, out of respect, everyone called me Grego, few called me Elena.\n[1962-12-20 13:00:00] At the school gate | I saw Gino start to loiter near the school gate, waiting for me to go back with him to our residence at Mergellina.\n[1962-12-20 13:30:00] Street | One day when I came home, he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend.\n[1962-12-20 13:31:00] Street | I saw myself taking a deep breath, and I accepted him. I thought, even though he was still a little kid, at least it's better than nothing.\n[1962-12-25 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself once again merging back into our Mergellina. I thought about how the pressure of excitement and unease during Christmas was relieved.\n[1962-12-25 10:05:00] Mergellina | I felt I had a bit more time now, and I often met with Lina.\n[1962-12-25 10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw her realize I was studying English, so she went and borrowed a grammar book too.\n[1962-12-25 10:15:00] Mergellina | I know she now knows many English words, and her pronunciation is passable. I thought, of course my pronunciation was no better.\n[1962-12-25 10:20:00] Mergellina | I saw that she had been harassing me all along. I heard people always saying: \"After you go back to school, ask the teacher how to read this character, how to read that one.\"\n[1962-12-26 15:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | One day, she took me to her shop and showed me a metal box. I saw some paper slips inside: one side was in Italian, the other in English: \"Pencil; Understand; Shoe.\"\n[1962-12-26 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I knew that was Professor Ferraro's suggested method, and it was an excellent way to learn new words.\n[1962-12-26 15:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her reading in Italian, wanting me to speak in English. I thought, but my vocabulary was so limited it was almost nonexistent.\n[1962-12-26 15:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how I felt she was better than me in every way, as if she had attended some secret school.\n[1962-12-26 15:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, and I also noticed, that what she cared about was showing me that she knew everything I had learned.\n[1962-12-26 15:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I didn't want to talk about it, but she kept asking me about Greek cases.\n[1962-12-26 15:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how I had just begun to learn the first case, while she had already learned the third.\n[1962-12-26 15:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her asking me about the plot of the Aeneid. I know she has been deeply fascinated by this epic recently.\n[1962-12-26 15:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I knew that she had finished the entire epic in just a few days, but I had only reached halfway through the second chapter at school.\n[1962-12-26 15:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her talking to me about Queen Dido, going into many details. I thought of her, but I still knew nothing about this person.\n[1962-12-26 15:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought I hadn't first heard the name at school, but from her.\n[1962-12-27 16:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw one afternoon that she made a comment. I thought of something that left me deeply shocked.\n[1962-12-27 16:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard her say: Without love, not only would people's lives become dull, but the life of the entire city would also become boring.\n[1962-12-27 16:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought I didn't remember exactly how that sentence was worded, but the content was basically like that.\n[1962-12-27 16:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about connecting this sentence with the dirty streets where we lived, the dusty parks, the countryside ruined by new buildings, and the acts of violence that happened in every home.\n[1962-12-27 16:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that I had not responded. I thought about how worried I was that she might bring up Fascist, the Nazis, and Communist Party.\n[1962-12-27 16:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I wanted her to understand that many good things had happened to me, so I told her two things in one breath. I heard that first, I became boyfriend and girlfriend with Gino, and then Nino also came to my school. He's even more handsome now than when he was in elementary school.\n[1962-12-27 16:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her squint her eyes. I thought about how worried I was that she might say to me: \"I've also started dating a boyfriend.\"\n[1962-12-27 16:31:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard it, but I didn't say anything. She teased me, saying, \"You slept with the pharmacist's son. Not bad! You've also given yourself to someone, just like Aeneas' lover...\"\n[1962-12-27 16:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her suddenly shift the topic from Queen Dido to Melina.\n[1962-12-27 16:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her and we talked for a long time. I know that because I basically didn't know what was happening in our building, I left for school very early and came back very late at night.\n[1962-12-27 16:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I knew that when Lina mentioned this relative from her family, she always seemed to be watching her closely. The children didn't eat well, and she had to clean and wash the stairs along with Pinocchia (Antonio's earnings were never enough).\n[1962-12-27 16:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I knew I would never hear her singing in the stairwell again, the happy times had passed, she just worked mechanically.\n[1962-12-27 16:55:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know, according to Lina's description, that Melina bent over and cleaned each step, starting from the top floor, wiping them one flight at a time with a damp cloth, cleaning them thoroughly. Even someone stronger than her would have been worn out in the end.\n[1962-12-27 17:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know that if someone went up and down the hallway while she was cleaning it, she would start cursing.\n[1962-12-27 17:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know that Pinocchio told Lina that once someone ruined her mother's work, and she had an episode where she drank dirty water from a bucket. Pinocchio had to take the bucket away from her.\n[1962-12-27 17:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | Do you see what I mean? As we talked, we moved from Gino to Dido, and then to Aeneas abandoning Queen Dido, and finally to that mad widow.\n[1962-12-27 17:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | At that moment, I once again mentioned Nino.\n[1962-12-27 17:16:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her listen carefully to what I said, and then she said to me. I heard, \"Tell him about Melina, and have him tell his father.\"\n[1962-12-27 17:17:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard her add, bitterly, \"Just writing a few poems is too easy.\"\n[1962-12-27 17:18:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her smile in the end, swearing in a very solemn tone. I heard, \"I will never love anyone, and I will never write any poetry.\"\n[1962-12-27 17:19:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I don't believe it.\" \"That's it.\"\n[1962-12-27 17:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"But others will fall in love with you.\" \"That's their bad luck.\"\n[1962-12-27 17:21:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"They'll suffer like Queen Dido.\" \"No, they'll be together with someone else, just like Aeneas did, and in the end he ended up with a king's daughter.\"\n[1962-12-27 17:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I still didn't believe it.\n[1962-12-28 15:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | Sometimes I also mention the topic of boyfriends and girlfriends, and now I have a boyfriend. I like talking about these things.\n[1962-12-28 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I remember once, I asked her very carefully. I heard, \"What's Marcello doing now? Is he still chasing you?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1962-12-28 15:06:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her sneer slightly, meaning: Marcello makes me feel sick. \"I heard 'What about you?'\"\n[1962-12-28 15:07:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"What about Enzo?\" \"We're friends.\"\n[1962-12-28 15:08:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Where's Stefano?\" \"Do you think everyone's after me?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1962-12-28 15:09:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Every time I go to their store, even though there are many people in line, he always takes care of me first.\"\n[1962-12-28 15:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Did you see it?\" \"There's nothing to see.\"\n[1962-12-28 15:11:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"What about Pasquale? Did he confess to you?\" \"Are you crazy?\"\n[1962-12-28 15:12:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'I saw him accompany you to the store this morning.' 'He explained to me what happened before we were born.\"\n[1962-12-28 15:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how this brought us back to the topic of \"before,\" but it was completely different from the \"before\" we used to talk about when we were children.\n[1962-12-28 15:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard her say that we know nothing, neither before nor now, because we can't understand what has happened.\n[1962-12-28 15:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard everything, every stone, or rather, every piece of wood, had appeared before us.\n[1962-12-28 15:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard that we grew up here, but neither of us ever realized it, never thought about it, and couldn't understand it.\n[1962-12-28 15:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard that it wasn't just us; her father pretended nothing had happened before, and her mother did the same.\n[1962-12-28 15:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard my parents, including Rino, all pretending not to know that Stefano's Capodimonte \"before\" was the Peruzzo carpenter shop, belonging to Pasquale's father; the money from Don Achille, and the money from the Solara family was \"before\" earned.\n[1962-12-28 15:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her testing her parents, who knew nothing and didn't want to talk about it.\n[1962-12-28 15:55:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard that there was no Fascist, no king, no oppression, no tyranny, no exploitation — none of these had ever existed.\n[1962-12-28 16:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard they hated Don Achille and were afraid of the Solara family, but they didn't care. They spent money at Don Achille's son's store, and sometimes they made us go there too.\n[1962-12-28 16:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard them voting for Fascist, voting for the royalists, because Solara made them do it.\n[1962-12-28 16:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard them think that the past was over, that they had already placed a stone on top of it, but they were still inside, just as before, and they made us stay inside as well.\n[1962-12-28 16:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard it like that, we didn't even realize it, everything remained the same.\n[1962-12-28 16:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about the topic of \"before,\" and it shocked me more than any of the other terrifying subjects she had talked about.\n[1962-12-28 17:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that we talked about a lot during that Christmas holiday, in the shop, on the street, in the yard—we discussed everything, even the smallest things. We felt at ease.",

I reported my results to Teacher Oliviero, and she praised me.\n[1962-12-29 10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw myself meeting with Gino every day, walking together to Capodimonte, where he would buy a snack, and we would eat it together before heading back.\n[1962-12-29 10:15:00] Mergellina | I sometimes even have the feeling that it's Lina who depends on me, not the other way around.\n[1962-12-29 10:20:00] Mergellina | I thought about how I had left our Mergellina to go to high school, and I was with boys who studied Latin and Greek, unlike her, who could only be with bricklayers, craftsmen, shoemakers, fruit sellers, meat sellers, and cobblers.\n[1962-12-29 10:25:00] Mergellina | I saw how, when she talked to me about Queen Dido, methods for learning English words, the third case in Greek, or the political topics she discussed with Pasquale, . I thought to myself that I was increasingly aware that she was doing it to get my attention.\n[1962-12-29 10:30:00] Mergellina | I thought that, as if she too had finally felt the need to show me that she could think just like me.\n[1962-12-29 15:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw it, even one afternoon when she hesitated a bit and decided to let me see the shoes she and Rino had secretly made.\n[1962-12-29 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how I would never again feel that sense of her living in a magical world without me.\n[1962-12-29 15:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought to myself that even she, and her brother as well, felt a bit embarrassed when they talked about these disgraceful matters.\n[1962-12-29 15:11:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, or perhaps it was just my own feeling of being superior.\n[1962-12-29 15:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw them rummaging in the storage room, and when they took out a paper package, I pretended to encourage them to open it.\n[1962-12-29 15:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw it, but when they showed me a pair of men's shoes, I immediately felt that the shoes were unusual:\n[1962-12-29 15:21:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the shoes were brown, size forty-three, and both Rino and Fernando wore that size.\n[1962-12-29 15:22:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw the shoes and they were exactly the same as the design drawing of Lina's. They looked light yet sturdy, and I had never seen anyone wear such shoes before.\n[1962-12-29 15:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw them letting me touch the shoes and showing me their quality, and I praised them with an enthusiastic voice.\n[1962-12-29 15:26:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard \"Feel here,\" Rino said, and my praise had lifted his spirits. \"Tell me, can you feel the seam?\"\n[1962-12-29 15:27:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'It can't be touched, it can't be felt.' I answered.\"\n[1962-12-29 15:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | At that moment, he took the shoes from my hands, folded them, rubbed them a bit, and showed me how sturdy they were.\n[1962-12-29 15:31:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I nodded in agreement, just like when Professor Oliviero encouraged us. I heard myself say, \"Great!\"\n[1962-12-29 15:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that Lina didn't look at all satisfied, unlike her brother who was excited. She pointed out the problem with the shoes to Rino. I heard, \"Can Dad tell these flaws at a glance?\"\n[1962-12-29 15:40:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I later heard her say seriously, \"Let's try water again.\"\n[1962-12-29 15:41:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw my brother express his disagreement, but she still filled the basin with water, put one hand into the shoe, pretending it was a foot, and \"walked\" a few steps in the water.\n[1962-12-29 15:42:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard him say, \"She wants to play around.\" Rino said impatiently to me, like an older brother talking about his mischievous younger sister.\n[1962-12-29 15:43:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him looking at Lina taking out the shoe, then he looked worried and asked. \"I heard 'How is it going?'\"\n[1962-12-29 15:44:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina pull her hand out, touch a few fingers together, and hand him the shoes. I heard, \"Touch it.\"\n[1962-12-29 15:45:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Rino put his hand inside and said. I heard, \"The shoes are dry.\"\n[1962-12-29 15:46:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard, 'Only you would think that. It's actually damp. Rino, feel it!'\"\n[1962-12-29 15:47:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw it and touched it too. \"I heard 'a bit damp.'\" I said.\n[1962-12-29 15:48:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina make a very unhappy face.\n[1962-12-29 15:49:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"You saw it, didn't you? It got that wet just from being in the water for a minute. That won't work. We have to take it apart and do it again.\"\n[1962-12-29 15:50:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Rino getting angry. I heard, \"Damn! It's a bit damp, but so what?\"\n[1962-12-29 15:51:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that, not only that, right before my eyes, he seemed to be changing: his face turned very red, and the area around his eyes and his cheekbones swelled up.\n[1962-12-29 15:52:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that he had finally had enough and started cursing his sister.\n[1962-12-29 15:53:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him cursing and complaining about how much longer this would go on.\n[1962-12-29 15:54:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him blaming Lina, saying that she had first encouraged him, and now was making him lose heart.\n[1962-12-29 15:55:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him shouting, saying he never wanted to stay in this disgusting place anymore, to be a slave to his father, watching everyone else get rich.\n[1962-12-29 15:56:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him pick up a metal shoe last to throw at Lina.\n[1962-12-29 15:57:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought that if he really threw her out, Lina would be killed on the spot.\n[1962-12-29 16:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw myself leaving their shop, feeling a bit disoriented.\n[1962-12-29 16:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, on one hand, I didn't know why the usually polite young man had become so angry; on the other hand, I felt proud that my opinion had become so authoritative and decisive.\n[1962-12-30 08:00:00] Home | I noticed over the next few days that the pimples on my face were drying up.\n[1962-12-30 09:00:00] Home | I heard Lina say, \"You look really good, it must be the school life that's making you so happy, and also the result of being in love.\" She said it with some sadness.\n[1962-12-30 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that during the New Year, Rino was obsessed with setting off a lot of firecrackers and fireworks on New Year's Eve, more than anyone else, especially to outdo the Solara brothers.\n[1962-12-30 10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Lina tease him, but she could also be very strict with him sometimes.\n[1962-12-30 10:10:00] Mergellina | I heard her say that she thought at first her brother had doubted the idea of getting rich by making shoes, but now he had become too radical, considering himself the owner of the \"Lina\" shoe factory, and no longer wanted to be just an ordinary shoemaker.\n[1962-12-30 10:15:00] Mergellina | I knew this troubled her, and she hadn't known this side of Rino before.\n[1962-12-30 10:20:00] Mergellina | I thought she always believed that her brother was just a bit impatient, occasionally aggressive, but not someone who liked to boast.\n[1962-12-30 10:25:00] Mergellina | I know his attitude is different now from what it used to be; he feels he is about to become rich, a small boss.\n[1962-12-30 10:30:00] Mergellina | I knew that in his eyes, the Solara brothers were the model of successful young men, ones to be imitated and surpassed.\n[1962-12-30 10:35:00] Mergellina | I know, so he wants to set off a lot of fireworks and firecrackers during the New Year, symbolizing that in the new year he will surpass them.\n[1962-12-30 10:40:00] Mergellina | I know that those people in Mergellina who harbored jealousy toward the Solara family all saw the Solaras as enemies, someone to be defeated and replaced.\n[1962-12-30 10:45:00] Mergellina | I know Lina never gossips, she's not like the other girls in the courtyard, like Carmela.\n[1962-12-30 10:50:00] Mergellina | I heard her say this time: \"Maybe, I made him have a fantasy, and now he can't control that dream.\"\n[1962-12-30 10:55:00] Mergellina | I knew that it had been Lina's dream, and she believed it could come true; her brother was an essential part of making it happen.\n[1962-12-30 11:00:00] Mergellina | I thought of something else—she loved her older brother, who was six years older than her, but she didn't want to turn him into a little boy who couldn't control his own dreams.\n[1962-12-30 11:05:00] Mergellina | I know she often said that Rino lacked practicality, couldn't be grounded, and when faced with difficulties, he was always a bit extreme, like competing with the Solara brothers.\n[1962-12-30 11:10:00] Mergellina | \"I heard her say, 'Maybe it's because he's jealous of Marcello.'\" Once, I told her.\n[1962-12-30 11:11:00] Mergellina | \"I heard 'that means?'”\n[1962-12-30 11:15:00] Mergellina | I saw her smile, pretending to be foolish.\n[1962-12-30 11:20:00] Mergellina | I know it was actually she who told me, Marcello would hang around in front of their shop every day, sometimes walking, sometimes driving.\n[1962-12-30 11:25:00] Mergellina | I heard him warn his sister more than once: \"Don't talk to that bastard, not even in your dreams.\" I know Rino must have noticed by now.\n[1962-12-30 11:30:00] Mergellina | I thought that maybe Marcello had feelings for his sister, which is why he couldn't brutally smash the Solara brothers' faces, and instead he wanted to show his strength through fireworks.\n[1962-12-30 11:35:00] Mergellina | \"I heard, 'If things were like this, would you agree that I'm right?' 'In which way am I right?'\"\n[1962-12-30 11:36:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"It's him, he's become a show-off now. Where did he get the money to buy fireworks?\"\n[1962-12-30 11:40:00] Mergellina | I know it's true. The entire San Gregorio Armeno, in our Mergellina, that final night of the year was really a war:\n[1962-12-30 11:45:00] Mergellina | I saw dazzling flames and explosions everywhere. The thick smoke from the firecrackers and fireworks made it impossible to see anything around me. The smoke drifted into the house, blinding my eyes and making me cough violently.\n[1962-12-30 11:50:00] Mergellina | I know that firecrackers, sky rockets, and all kinds of fireworks cost money, and usually the person who has the most money is the one who sets off the most.\n[1962-12-30 11:55:00] Home | I knew our Greco family didn't have much money, and during the New Year, the amount of money we had for buying firecrackers was very little.\n[1962-12-30 12:00:00] Home | I knew my father would buy a box of fireworks, a string of firecrackers, and a few small cannons.",

There were the ones that exploded into stars and the spinning ones.\n[1962-12-30 23:55:00] Home | I was excited and scared, standing motionless there, watching the dazzling fireworks form fiery rings just a few inches from my fingers.\n[1962-12-31 00:00:00] Home | I saw my father run over, place the fountain firework into the glass bottle on the marble windowsill, and light the fuse with a cigarette.\n[1962-12-31 00:05:00] Home | I saw him getting very excited, and finally he threw the bottle into the street. I saw bright flames shooting up into the sky.\n[1962-12-31 00:10:00] Lina's house | I knew that Lina's family also had very few fireworks, almost none, and Rino had been protesting for a long time.\n[1962-12-31 00:15:00] Street | I know that since he was twelve, he's had a habit of going out at midnight on New Year's to collect the unexploded firecrackers with those men who were braver than his father.\n[1962-12-31 00:20:00] Street | I knew that as soon as the sound of firecrackers and fireworks stopped, he would run out.\n[1962-12-31 00:25:00] By the pond | I know he used to light the firecrackers and fireworks he found by the pond, enjoying the crackle of the firecrackers, the rockets shooting into the sky, and the joy of their final explosions.\n[1962-12-31 00:30:00] By the pond | I know he still has a scar on his hand, a wide mark, from the time he pulled his hand back too slowly once.\n[1962-12-31 00:35:00] Mergellina | I know that the confrontation at the end of 1958 had many surface and underlying reasons, and one more point to add is that Rino wanted to wash away the shame of his poor childhood.\n[1962-12-31 00:40:00] Mergellina | I knew he started making money everywhere, buying fireworks, but everyone, including himself, knew that despite his current fervor and boldness, he still couldn't match the Solara brothers.\n[1962-12-31 00:45:00] Mergellina | I know that every year, the two brothers would come and go in their \"Fiat 1100,\" each time carrying a suitcase full of firecrackers, which they would set off on New Year's night.\n[1962-12-31 00:50:00] Mergellina | I know those fireworks could kill birds, scare cats, dogs, and mice, and make every tile in the whole building tremble.\n[1962-12-31 00:55:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Rino looking at them with hostility from the shop.\n[1962-12-31 01:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I knew he was with Pasquale, Antonio, and especially Enzo—by then Enzo had some money, and they had also stockpiled some fireworks so they wouldn't lose face at least.\n[1962-12-31 10:00:00] Capodimonte | I remember the small, unexpected thing that happened when I went with Lina to Stefano Carraci's Capodimonte to buy things for the New Year's dinner—the task our mother had sent us on.\n[1962-12-31 10:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw that Alfonso Carracci was also helping behind the counter, along with Stefano and Pinocchia; he gave us an awkward smile. I saw that Capodimonte was packed with people.\n[1962-12-31 10:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw that we were behind the queue and estimated that we'd have to wait a long time, but Stefano clearly greeted us and said something in his brother's ear.\n[1962-12-31 10:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw my high school classmate Alfonso Carracci come out from behind the counter and ask us if we had a shopping list.\n[1962-12-31 10:16:00] Capodimonte | I saw that we gave him the list, and he took it and left.\n[1962-12-31 10:20:00] Capodimonte | I had watched for five minutes; the things we needed were all ready.\n[1962-12-31 10:25:00] Capodimonte | I saw us putting everything into the bags, paying Mrs. Maria, and then leaving.\n[1962-12-31 10:30:00] Outside Capodimonte | I saw him, but we hadn't taken a few steps when, instead of Alfonso Carracci, it was Stefano calling me in his mature man's voice. I heard \"Rino!\"\n[1962-12-31 10:35:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw him catch up with us, his expression calm, his smile polite. The only thing ruining his perfection was a stain on his white shirt.\n[1962-12-31 10:36:00] Outside Capodimonte | I saw he was speaking to both of us -- in the dialect, but his eyes were on me. \"I heard, 'Would you like to come to my house to celebrate the New Year? Alfonso Carracci also hopes you can come.'\"\n[1962-12-31 10:40:00] Outside Capodimonte | I know that after my father was murdered, Don Achille's wife and children lived simple lives, staying mostly indoors: going to church, Capodimonte, and home, and only attending gatherings they couldn't avoid.\n[1962-12-31 10:41:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought about how they had invited us, something that had never happened before.\n[1962-12-31 10:42:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I looked at Lina and answered. I heard, \"We already have an appointment, we're with Lina's brother, and many other friends...\"\n[1962-12-31 10:43:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard her say, \"You should also tell Rino, including your parents. Our house is big, you can set off firecrackers on the rooftop.\"\n[1962-12-31 10:44:00] Outside Capodimonte | I saw Lina insert a remark in a cold, distant tone. I heard, \"Pasquale and Pinochcia Peluso, and their mother will also be joining us for the holiday.\"\n[1962-12-31 10:45:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I know that Alfredo Peruzzo is now in prison because he killed Don Achille, and so Don Achille's son cannot invite Alfredo's child to celebrate New Year's in his house. I thought that line should have ended any possibility of further conversation.\n[1962-12-31 10:46:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw it, but Stefano was looking at Lina as if he had never noticed her, with a focused look and speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.\n[1962-12-31 10:47:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Okay, you all come. We'll drink champagne, dance together, new year, new life...\"\n[1962-12-31 10:48:00] Outside Capodimonte | I was moved by what he said.\n[1962-12-31 10:49:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I looked at Lina, and she also seemed confused, muttering something under her breath. I heard, \"We need to talk to my brother first.\"\n[1962-12-31 10:50:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Let me know when it's settled.\" \"What about the fireworks?\" \"What do you mean?\"\n[1962-12-31 10:51:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"We're taking our fireworks, how about you?\"\n[1962-12-31 10:52:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Stefano smile slightly and say. I heard, \"How many fireworks do you want?\"\n[1962-12-31 10:53:00] Outside Capodimonte | I heard \"so many, so many.\"\n[1962-12-31 10:54:00] Outside Capodimonte | I saw the young man look at me again and said. \"I heard, 'As long as you come to my house, I promise you, even when it's dawn, we'll still have fireworks to set off.'\"\n[1962-12-31 11:00:00] Street | I saw that all along the way, we laughed so hard we were doubled over, laughing and talking at the same time.\n[1962-12-31 11:01:00] Street | I heard, \"He did it because of you.\" I said. \"No, because of you.\"\n[1962-12-31 11:02:00] Street | I heard, \"He's fallen in love with you. To invite you to his house, he even invited Communist Party, even his father's killer...\"\n[1962-12-31 11:03:00] Street | I heard, \"What did you say? He didn't even look at me once.\"\n[1962-12-31 11:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Rino hear Stefano's proposal, and he immediately said he wouldn't go, but the desire to defeat the Solara family made him hesitate again and again.\n[1962-12-31 11:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him talking about it to Pasquale, and Pasquale was very angry.\n[1962-12-31 11:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Enzo mutter something. I heard, \"Well, if I can come, I will.\"\n[1962-12-31 11:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that as for our parents, they were very happy when they heard about the invitation.\n[1962-12-31 11:26:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know that because Don Achille is no longer alive, his wife and children are very polite people, extremely wealthy. It was a great honor to be able to become friends with them.\n[1962-12-31 11:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina beginning to lose her way, as if she had forgotten where she was.\n[1962-12-31 11:35:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her thinking about this question everywhere, on the street, in the neighborhood, even in the shoe repair shop.\n[1962-12-31 15:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw her later, one afternoon, when she appeared before me with an expression of sudden realization, and said. I heard, \"We were all wrong. Stefano doesn't want me, and he doesn't want you either.\"\n[1962-12-31 15:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that we discussed for a while in our usual way: facts mixed with our imaginations.\n[1962-12-31 15:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, if he wasn't after us, then what was he after? We thought, maybe Stefano also wanted to teach the Solara brothers a lesson.\n[1962-12-31 15:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I know that we remember when Michele made her kick Pasquale out on the day of her mother's birthday. He had brought up the matter of the Caracci family, inserted himself in the situation, all just to show that Stefano was ungrateful and had forgotten his own father.\n[1962-12-31 15:16:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, in that situation, those two brothers didn't just embarrass Pasquale, but also humiliated Stefano.\n[1962-12-31 15:17:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought that, therefore, this time Stefano would take his revenge and make it count: he wouldn't just reconcile with the Peluso family without holding any grudges, but he would even invite them to celebrate the New Year at his house, precisely to humiliate them.\n[1962-12-31 15:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard \"What would he get then?\" I asked Lina. \"I don't know. He wants to do something that no one in Mergellina has ever been able to do.\" \"Forgiveness?\"\n[1962-12-31 15:21:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina shaking her head with a look of suspicion on her face.\n[1962-12-31 15:22:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that she was also searching for answers, both of us wanting to figure things out.\n[1962-12-31 15:23:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought that Stefano didn't seem like the kind of person who could forgive others, according to Lina's view, he had his own plans in mind.\n[1962-12-31 15:24:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought that gradually, she connected the issues she had been thinking about recently—the questions she and Pasquale had been discussing—and finally it seemed she had found an answer.\n[1962-12-31 15:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | \"I heard you say that Camilla and Alfonso Carracci could be a couple?\" \"I remember.\"\n[1962-12-31 15:26:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"Stefano did something similar.\" \"Is he going to marry Camilla?\" \"It's not just that.\"\n[1962-12-31 15:30:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought that, according to Lina's view, Stefano wanted to erase everything and move on from what had happened before.\n[1962-12-31 15:31:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about how he didn't want to pretend, just like our parents did, pretending nothing had happened.\n[1962-12-31 15:32:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought about what he wanted to do, which could be summed up as: I know, my father was like that before, but now I am me, we are we, and everything in the past is gone.\n[1962-12-31 15:33:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought, in the end, he wanted everyone in Mergellina to understand that he wasn't Don Achille, and the Peruzzo family wasn't the same carpenter who had killed his father.\n[1962-12-31 15:34:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I thought of this theory, and we liked it very much. We quickly confirmed it and immediately took a liking to this young man from the Calogero family. We decided to take his side.\n[1962-12-31 16:00:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I told Rino, Pasquale, and Antonio about our discovery.\n[1962-12-31 16:05:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw that the invitation we spoke of regarding Stefano was not just an invitation; there was great significance behind it,.\n[1962-12-31 16:06:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard him seem to tell us: there had been a lot of bad things before us, our fathers— they were all bad in their own ways,\n[1962-12-31 16:07:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, but now we have to take action. We have to show them, as children, that we are a little stronger than them.\n[1962-12-31 16:08:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard \"Stronger?\" Rino asked, full of interest. \"I heard 'a bit better,' I said, 'completely different from the Solara brothers, because they're worse than their father, and even worse than their grandfather.'\"\n[1962-12-31 16:09:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw myself speaking in Italian with great excitement, just like when I was in school.\n[1962-12-31 16:10:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina looking at me with an expression of extreme surprise, while Rino, Pasquale, and Antonio muttered a few awkward words.\n[1962-12-31 16:15:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Pasquale trying to answer me in Italian, but he gave up quickly.\n[1962-12-31 16:16:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw him with a gloomy face saying. I heard, \"Now Stefano's business capital comes from the money his father made through the black market. The Capodimonte used to be my father's carpentry shop.\"\n[1962-12-31 16:17:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Lina's eyes narrow until they were almost invisible.\n[1962-12-31 16:18:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I heard, \"It's true. But will you stand with someone who wants to change, or with the Solara brothers?\"\n[1962-12-31 16:20:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw Pasquale, he said confidently. I heard, \"I'm just standing from my own perspective, that's all.\" I thought it was partly because of his beliefs, and partly because he was a little jealous, since Stefano had suddenly become the center of Lina's conversation.\n[1962-12-31 16:25:00] Shoemaker's Shop | I saw it, but he was a kind young man. He thought about it again and then went to talk to his mother, and to everyone in the family.",

    "text": "[1962-12-31 16:30:00] At Pasquale's house | I knew Giuseppina was a tireless worker, with a very good nature, cheerful and easygoing.\n[1962-12-31 16:35:00] Pasquale's House | I knew that ever since her husband had been taken away, she had completely changed; she was sad because of her own misfortune.\n[1962-12-31 16:40:00] Church | I saw her tell the priest about it.\n[1962-12-31 16:45:00] Capodimonte | I saw the priest pass by Stefano's shop, talk with Maria for a long time, and then go and speak with Giuseppina Peluso.\n[1962-12-31 16:50:00] At Pasquale's house | I thought that in the end, they all were certain that life was already hard enough, and if during the New Year holidays everyone got along a little better, it would be good for everyone.\n[1962-12-31 23:30:00] Stairwell | I saw it like this: On the night of December 31st at 11:30, after we had finished our New Year's feast, several families from different backgrounds - the entire family of the former carpenter, the entire family of the building's porter, the entire family of the cobbler, the entire family of the fruit seller, and the entire family of Melina -\n[1962-12-31 23:35:00] At Don Achille's house | I saw them gathering in groups on the fifth floor, in Don Achille's house, the one everyone had hated the most, to celebrate the New Year together. I saw that everything was neatly cleaned.\n[1962-12-31 23:35:10] At Don Achille's house | I saw Stefano greeting us very warmly. I saw what I remembered: his neatly combed hair.\n[1962-12-31 23:35:20] At Don Achille's house | I saw his face slightly flushed with excitement. He was wearing a white shirt, a tie, and a blue suit vest.\n[1962-12-31 23:35:30] At Don Achille's house | I thought he was really handsome back then, looking quite like a prince.\n[1962-12-31 23:35:40] At Don Achille's house | I thought to myself, secretly calculating in my heart, and found out that he was seven years older than both me and Lina.\n[1962-12-31 23:35:50] At Don Achille's house | I saw him coming to my house in Karachi to find me. I thought that, in those circumstances, my boyfriend Gino was really not worth anything.\n[1962-12-31 23:36:00] At Don Achille's house | I heard, but he told me he couldn't come because his parents wouldn't let him go out, saying it was dangerous to be out at night.\n[1962-12-31 23:36:10] At Don Achille's house | I thought about how I longed for a boyfriend who was a bit older, like Stefano, Pasquale, Rino, Antonio, or Enzo, rather than a kid.\n[1962-12-31 23:38:00] At Don Achille's house | I watched them, stealing glances at them all night long with my eyes.\n[1962-12-31 23:40:00] At Don Achille's house | I saw myself constantly running my hand over the silver bracelet my mother had given me, as well as the earrings. I thought I felt a bit nervous.\n[1962-12-31 23:40:10] At Don Achille's house | I thought again that I was beautiful, and I wanted their attention and approval.\n[1962-12-31 23:40:20] At Don Achille's house | I thought about it, but it felt like all the boys were thinking only about the night fireworks, waiting to compete with other men, as if they didn't care much about Lina.\n[1962-12-31 23:45:00] At Don Achille's house | I saw Stefano being especially polite to Mrs. Peluso and Melina.\n[1962-12-31 23:45:10] At Don Achille's house | I saw Melina say nothing. I saw her eyes as if they were enchanted.\n[1962-12-31 23:45:20] At Don Achille's house | I saw her nose was long, her hair was neatly combed, and she was wearing earrings.\n[1962-12-31 23:45:30] At Don Achille's house | I saw her wearing an old black dress for a widow. I thought of all this, and she seemed like a lady.\n[1963-01-01 00:00:00] At Don Achille's house | At midnight, I saw my master Stefano first pour a glass of champagne for his mother, then another for Pasquale's mother.\n[1963-01-01 00:00:10] At Don Achille's house | I saw us clinking glasses together. I heard us wishing that many happy and beautiful things would happen in the new year.\n[1963-01-01 00:00:20] Stairwell | After the toast, we went outside. I saw and felt that the weather was cold; the old people and children were all wearing coats and scarves.\n[1963-01-01 00:00:30] Stairwell | I thought to myself that the only one who didn't want to go out was Alfonso Carracci.\n[1963-01-01 00:00:35] Stairwell | I saw him and, out of courtesy, called his name. I thought he hadn't heard, or was pretending not to have heard.\n[1963-01-01 00:01:00] Tiantai | I saw myself running up to the rooftop. I saw a terrible sky above me, filled with darkness, stars, and cold.\n[1963-01-01 00:01:10] Tiantai | I saw the young men all wearing sweaters; even Pasquale and Enzo were only wearing shirts.\n[1963-01-01 00:01:20] Tiantai | I saw Lina, Pinocchia, Carmela, and me all wearing thin dresses — the ones we wore to the ball.\n[1963-01-01 00:01:30] Tiantai | I thought about how we were both shivering from the cold, but feeling extremely excited.\n[1963-01-01 00:01:40] Tiantai | I saw that we had already heard the sound of several fireworks. I saw several bright lights streak across the sky, blooming into colorful flowers.\n[1963-01-01 00:02:00] Tiantai | I heard the sound of people throwing old items out of the windows, along with shouts and laughter.\n[1963-01-01 00:02:10] Tiantai | I saw that I felt the entire residential area was immersed in noise, and I heard the sound of firecrackers exploding.\n[1963-01-01 00:02:20] Tiantai | I saw myself lighting the fireworks, and the spinning firecrackers in the children's hands. I thought about how I liked watching the fear and astonishment in their eyes, even though I myself had once felt that way as a child.\n[1963-01-01 00:02:30] Tiantai | I saw Lina persuade Melina, and they both lit a \"Bengal\" firecracker.\n[1963-01-01 00:02:40] Tiantai | I saw the two of them shouting with excitement and hugging each other. I saw a colorful firework shoot up.\n[1963-01-01 00:03:00] Tiantai | I saw Rino, Stefano, Pasquale, Enzo, and Antonio carrying box after box of fireworks onto the roof. I thought that I felt they were all proud because their resources were so abundant.\n[1963-01-01 00:03:10] Tiantai | I saw Alfonso Carracci had joined as well. I thought about it, but I could see he wasn't very eager. He only came up because his brother was pressuring him.\n[1963-01-01 00:03:20] Tiantai | I thought he felt a bit shy in front of Rino.\n[1963-01-01 00:03:30] Tiantai | I saw Rino looking very excited; he took something from Alfonso Carracci, treating him like a child.\n[1963-01-01 00:03:40] Tiantai | I saw that Alfonso Carracci wasn't angry at all; he just stepped back and didn't get involved with the other boys.\n[1963-01-01 00:04:00] Tiantai | At that moment, they lit matches, and some of the older boys lit each other's cigarettes.\n[1963-01-01 00:04:10] Tiantai | I saw them covering their faces with their hands, talking seriously and politely.\n[1963-01-01 00:04:20] Tiantai | I thought to myself, was it possible that a civil war would break out, like the one between Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome.\n[1963-01-01 00:04:30] Tiantai | I thought of others, like Marius and Sulla, or perhaps Caesar and Pompey, the struggle between them.\n[1963-01-01 00:04:40] Tiantai | I thought of their faces, their looks and postures, which reminded me of those people.\n[1963-01-01 00:05:00] Tiantai | I saw that, except for Alfonso Carracci, every man had firecrackers in his pockets, and they put the fireworks inside empty bottles.\n[1963-01-01 00:05:10] Tiantai | I saw that Rino's task, given to me, Lina, Pinocchio, and Camilla, was to supply the fireworks on time.\n[1963-01-01 00:05:20] Tiantai | I saw Rino becoming more and more excited, shouting at us loudly.\n[1963-01-01 00:06:00] Tiantai | I watched until the very end, the young boys—my brothers Peppe and Gianni, and the men who were no longer young—like my father, and the oldest shoemaker—they also started moving in the darkness and cold.\n[1963-01-01 00:06:10] Tiantai | I saw them light the fuse of the package, and the fireworks shot into the sky or hit the rooftop railing.\n[1963-01-01 00:07:00] Tiantai | I heard everyone shouting: \"Look at how vibrant the colors are! How loud the sound is!\" I felt that the festival atmosphere was very strong, and people were very excited.\n[1963-01-01 00:07:10] Tiantai | I saw them hear Melina's terrified scream and comfort her. I heard, \"It's nothing! It's nothing!\"\n[1963-01-01 00:08:00] Tiantai | I saw Rino snatch the loose firecrackers from my two younger brothers and light them himself.\n[1963-01-01 00:08:10] Tiantai | I heard him shouting that they were just wasting time, that they had thrown it out before the fuse had even been lit.\n[1963-01-01 00:09:00] Tiantai | I saw the fireworks in the city sky becoming brighter and denser.\n[1963-01-01 00:09:10] Tiantai | After the sound of the fireworks faded, I heard the honking of cars again, along with a vast darkness.\n[1963-01-01 00:09:20] Tiantai | Even though the smoke was thick, I saw that the Solara brothers' balcony was shining even more brightly.\n[1963-01-01 00:09:30] Tiantai | I thought about how their balcony was very close to ours, and we could see them.\n[1963-01-01 00:09:40] Tiantai | I thought about how those fathers, relatives, and friends, just like us, wanted to create chaos and the festive atmosphere.\n[1963-01-01 00:09:50] Tiantai | I knew that everyone in Mergellina knew, by then, that it had only just begun.\n[1963-01-01 00:10:00] Tiantai | I thought about when the entire Mergellina poor people had finished setting off their meager firecrackers, that silver and golden drizzle, the Solara family would really start setting off fireworks.\n[1963-01-01 00:10:10] Tiantai | I thought that only at this moment did they reveal themselves as the true masters of the festival, because only they were left, freely setting off fireworks.\n[1963-01-01 00:11:00] Tiantai | I saw it just like that, I saw the fireworks from the Solara family's balcony suddenly become dense, the sky and the street exploding.\n[1963-01-01 00:11:10] Tiantai | Every time a firework lit up, especially after a deafening burst of firecrackers, I heard a lewd laugh coming from their balcony.\n[1963-01-01 00:11:20] Tiantai | What surprised me was that Stefano, Pasquale, Antonio, and Rino responded with equally loud firecrackers and fireworks.\n[1963-01-01 00:11:30] Tiantai | I saw the Solara family setting off fireworks, so we responded with fireworks; they launched skyrockets, so we responded with skyrockets.\n[1963-01-01 00:11:40] Tiantai | I saw all kinds of colorful, enchanting flower crowns spreading out in the air, while on the ground, firecrackers exploded loudly.\n[1963-01-01 00:12:00] Tiantai | I saw suddenly, Rino jumped onto the rooftop railing, shouting curses as he threw out those highly explosive firecrackers.\n[1963-01-01 00:12:05] Tiantai | I heard his mother scream in fear: \"Come down, you'll fall!\"\n[1963-01-01 00:12:10] Tiantai | I saw that at this moment, Melina was also startled, shouting loudly, her voice high-pitched and lasting a long time.\n[1963-01-01 00:12:20] Tiantai | I saw Pinocchia sigh, and she had to take her mother away.\n[1963-01-01 00:12:30] Tiantai | I saw Alfonso Carracci make a gesture to Pinocchia, meaning he would take care of Melina, and he led Melina downstairs.\n[1963-01-01 00:12:40] Tiantai | I saw my mother also limping after them right away, and the other women went down with their children as well.\n[1963-01-01 00:13:00] Tiantai | I heard the sound of explosions from the Solara house growing louder.\n[1963-01-01 00:13:10] Tiantai | I saw it suddenly—their fireworks didn't go up into the sky, but instead flew straight toward the rooftop where we were standing, bringing a burst of red light and suffocating smoke.\n[1963-01-01 00:13:20] Tiantai | I heard \"They did it on purpose.\" Rino said to Stefano. I thought I saw that he was furious.\n[1963-01-01 00:13:30] Tiantai | I saw him calm Rino down. I saw that in the night, Stefano was just a cold, black shadow.\n[1963-01-01 00:13:40] Tiantai | I saw him run to a corner where there were boxes of fireworks. He first warned us girls not to touch them, then told a few boys to go get them.\n[1963-01-01 00:13:50] Tiantai | I heard \"Enzo.\" He called out, \"Pascal, Rino, Anton! Come here, come on! Let's make them hear what we've got...\" I thought about how I could no longer detect any of the soft tone a salesperson usually used.\n[1963-01-01 00:14:00] Tiantai | I saw everyone laughing as they ran past. I heard everyone saying: \"Stefano! Yes! Let them hear it, let them die, these bastards!\"\n[1963-01-01 00:14:10] Tiantai | I saw them making obscene gestures toward the Solara family's balcony.\n[1963-01-01 00:14:20] Tiantai | I saw their restless black figures and felt myself growing colder and colder.\n[1963-01-01 00:14:30] Tiantai | I knew that we girls were left aside, and it wasn't our business. My father and the cobbler also went downstairs.\n[1963-01-01 00:14:40] Tiantai | I saw her silent, completely absorbed in the scene before her. I thought about what it felt like not to know Lina.\n[1963-01-01 00:14:50] Tiantai | I know I've mentioned this before, but she called what happened to her that day \"the disappearance of the boundary.\"\n[1963-01-01 00:15:00] Tiantai | I heard her tell me that it was like a moonlit night at sea, when suddenly the sky became covered with dark clouds, and a storm came, swallowing all the light.\n[1963-01-01 00:15:10] Tiantai | I heard them smash that bright, round disk back into its original form, turning it into a rough, meaningless mass.\n[1963-01-01 00:15:20] Tiantai | I thought about the scenes Lina imagined, saw, and heard as if they were real: her brother was breaking apart, and Rino had lost his true form in her eyes.\n[1963-01-01 00:15:30] Tiantai | I thought that was the face she had always remembered—a generous, honest young man whose facial features gave a sense of security, the face she had loved since childhood, the one who once made her laugh, helped her, and protected her.\n[1963-01-01 00:15:40] Tiantai | I thought of it, but there, in the cold wind and the loud explosions, in the thick, acrid smell of sulfur, she felt something unknown break apart her brother's body.\n[1963-01-01 00:15:50] Tiantai | I thought about the pressure that had been placed on him, so great that his shape and contours broke apart, revealing his true face.\n[1963-01-01 00:16:00] Tiantai | Every second of that festival filled her with terror. She saw Rino moving, and the substance spreading around him was also moving. The boundaries of his body were vanishing.\n[1963-01-01 00:16:10] Tiantai | I thought about how the boundaries of her own body had also become more flexible and fragile.\n[1963-01-01 00:16:20] Tiantai | I thought she found it hard to control herself, but in the end she managed to do so, not showing her anxiety and breakdown.\n[1963-01-01 00:16:30] Tiantai | I thought to myself, truly, amid the deafening sound of firecrackers and the dazzling fireworks, I hadn't noticed her.\n[1963-01-01 00:16:40] Tiantai | I thought, but I felt her expression growing more and more fearful, which shocked me.\n[1963-01-01 00:16:50] Tiantai | I saw that I noticed her staring at her brother's shadow—Rino was the most energetic, the most reckless, the most outspoken of them all. He was cursing vigorously in the direction of the Solara family's balcony.\n[1963-01-01 00:17:00] Tiantai | I saw Lina looking at her brother with an annoyed expression. I thought Lina was usually fearless, but at that moment she looked completely terrified.\n[1963-01-01 00:17:10] Tiantai | I didn't think about it carefully at the time; I felt closer to Carmela and Pinocchia. It was something I realized later.",

    "text": "[1963-01-01 00:17:20] Tiantai | I thought of her as usual, as if she didn't need the attention of those boys at all. And we were caught in the cold wind and chaos; without those guys, we would feel our existence had no meaning.\n[1963-01-01 00:17:30] Tiantai | I thought that if Stefano, Enzo, or Rino could stop fighting and come running over to put their arms around our shoulders, pressing close to us and saying nice things, that would be what we were longing for.\n[1963-01-01 00:17:40] Tiantai | I saw us huddled together for warmth, while they were busy grabbing those highly explosive fireworks and lighting the fuses.\n[1963-01-01 00:17:50] Tiantai | I thought they were excited because Stefano had a lot of fireworks, and they appreciated his generosity, but at the same time, they were uneasy about so much money turning into streams of fireworks, flashes, explosions, and smoke.\n[1963-01-01 00:18:00] Tiantai | I thought that, no matter what, they were satisfied with the advantage they had gained.\n[1963-01-01 00:18:10] Tiantai | I wondered how long the match between them and the Solara brothers had been going on.\n[1963-01-01 00:18:20] Tiantai | I saw explosions erupting on both sides, as if the rooftop and balcony were trenches, and the entire Mergellina was trembling, making my head spin.\n[1963-01-01 00:18:30] Tiantai | I heard the sound of firecrackers and breaking glass rising and falling continuously, as if the sky were collapsing.\n[1963-01-01 00:19:00] Tiantai | I heard Enzo shouting, \"They're out of stock! They're finished, we can keep going!\"\n[1963-01-01 00:19:10] Tiantai | I saw especially Rino, who kept going until there wasn't even a single firecracker left.\n[1963-01-01 00:19:20] Tiantai | I saw everyone cheering in victory, jumping around and hugging each other.\n[1963-01-01 00:19:30] Tiantai | I saw everyone finally calm down, and the surroundings became quiet.\n[1963-01-01 00:19:40] Tiantai | I saw that this silence didn't last long; from afar came the sounds of children crying, shouting, and cursing, as well as the noise of cars driving on streets piled with garbage.\n[1963-01-01 00:20:00] Tiantai | I saw it all, and we saw the flash of fire coming from the Solara family's balcony. I heard the sound of \"click! click!\" coming toward us, very crisp and clear.\n[1963-01-01 00:20:10] Tiantai | I heard Rino exclaim in disappointment, \"Let's start over.\"\n[1963-01-01 00:20:20] Tiantai | I saw it, and Enzo immediately understood what was happening, pushing us inside the house. After him, Pasquale and Stefano also realized what was going on.\n[1963-01-01 00:20:30] Tiantai | I saw that only Rino was cursing loudly, leaning over the rooftop railing.\n[1963-01-01 00:20:40] Tiantai | I saw Lina dodge Pasquale and pull her brother in this time, and she started shouting at him.\n[1963-01-01 00:20:50] Tiantai | I saw us girls shouting and running down too. I thought about how the Solara brothers had tried to shoot us because they couldn't beat us with fireworks.\n[1963-01-01 00:25:00] Stairwell | I thought I had already said that, that night I missed a lot of things.\n[1963-01-01 00:25:10] Stairwell | I thought about the rich festive atmosphere, the danger we faced, and especially the passion that burst forth from those men, which was more thrilling than the fireworks in the sky. I ignored Lina.\n[1963-01-01 00:25:20] Stairwell | I know that's when her inner world began to change.\n[1963-01-01 00:25:30] Stairwell | I thought to myself that I had already said it, but I hadn't realized what had happened to her at the time.\n[1963-01-01 00:25:40] Stairwell | At first, it was hard to understand her change just by looking at the surface, but I soon realized it: she had become very lazy.\n[1963-01-03 08:00:00] Residential Area | Two days after that evening, even though I didn't have to go to school, I got up very early, wanting to walk with her to the shop, to help her clean and open it, but she didn't show up.\n[1963-01-03 09:30:00] Residential Area | I saw that later she came out very late, and she looked angry. We walked through the residential area, trying to avoid their shop.\n[1963-01-03 09:30:10] Residential Area | I heard, \"Aren't you going to work?\"\n[1963-01-03 09:30:15] Residential Area | I heard \"I'm not going.\"\n[1963-01-03 09:30:20] Residential Area | I heard \"Why?\"\n[1963-01-03 09:30:25] Residential Area | I heard, \"I don't want to go.\"\n[1963-01-03 09:30:30] Residential Area | I heard, \"New shoes?\"\n[1963-01-03 09:30:35] Residential Area | I heard, \"It's still a long way to go.\"\n[1963-01-03 09:30:40] Residential Area | I heard, \"What should we do?\"\n[1963-01-03 09:31:00] Residential Area | I thought to myself, she didn't even know what she wanted to do.\n[1963-01-03 09:31:10] Residential Area | The only thing I was certain of was that she was more worried about her brother than when I had seen her before.\n[1963-01-03 09:31:20] Residential Area | I thought it was precisely this worry that changed her view on wealth.\n[1963-01-03 09:31:30] Residential Area | I thought about how she still desperately wanted to become rich, which was nothing to talk about, but wealth was no longer what she had imagined as a child: no safe, no gleam of jewels and gold coins.\n[1963-01-03 09:31:40] Residential Area | I thought that in her mind, wealth now seemed to have turned into cement—hardening, strengthening, fixing this and that thing, especially repairing Rino's brain.\n[1963-01-03 09:32:00] Residential Area | I know the shoes they made together. Rino thought they were already finished and wanted to show them to Fernando.\n[1963-01-03 09:32:10] Residential Area | I thought, but Lina clearly knew (she felt Rino should also know) that those shoes were a problem, and her father would throw them away the moment he saw them.\n[1963-01-03 09:32:20] Residential Area | I know that's why she said, they need to try again, to make more changes, because starting a shoe factory is a very difficult process.\n[1963-01-03 09:32:30] Residential Area | I thought, but Rino no longer wanted to wait anymore; he was eager to be as rich as the Solara brothers or Stefano.\n[1963-01-03 09:32:40] Residential Area | I thought that Lina was already unable to argue with him.\n[1963-01-03 09:32:50] Residential Area | I thought that suddenly, I felt she had lost interest in wealth itself; when talking about money, she no longer lit up with excitement, but just saw it as a way to prevent her brother from getting into trouble.\n[1963-01-03 09:33:00] Residential Area | I heard her say, \"It's all my fault,\" confessing to me, \"I made him believe that wealth was within reach, just around the corner.\"\n[1963-01-03 09:33:10] Residential Area | I saw her staring at me with a slightly fierce look and asked, \"How can I make him calm down?\" I thought about it, but there was no wealth at the street corner.\n[1963-01-03 09:33:20] Residential Area | I was really obsessed with Rino, for example, Lina no longer went to the shop.\n[1963-01-03 09:33:30] Residential Area | I knew Fernando never blamed her. On the contrary, he said he was glad Lina stayed at home to help mother with the chores, while her brother was unusually angry.\n[1963-01-03 14:00:00] Street | I saw that after the New Year, they had a big fight.\n[1963-01-03 14:00:10] Street | I saw Rino looking down, blocking our way on the road, and said to Lina. I heard, \"Hurry up and get to work!\"\n[1963-01-03 14:00:20] Street | I heard Lina reply, \"Not a chance.\"\n[1963-01-03 14:00:30] Street | I saw him and reached out to grab her arm, but she shook off his hand and started cursing.\n[1963-01-03 14:00:40] Street | I saw Rino slap her and shout, \"Then go home, help your mother with the work.\"\n[1963-01-03 14:00:50] Street | I saw her walk away without even saying hello after hearing Rino's words.",

    "text": "[1963-01-06 08:00:00] Lina's house | I saw their conflict reach its peak on Epiphany. When Lina woke up in the morning, she found a sock filled with coal by her bed, and she understood it was Rino's doing.\n[1963-01-06 08:30:00] Lina's House | I saw her setting the table for breakfast, giving everyone their utensils, but she didn't set one for Rino.\n[1963-01-06 08:35:00] Lina's house | I saw her mother appear at this moment. Her son had hung a sock on the chair next to her bed, filled with candies and chocolates, and she was deeply moved.\n[1963-01-06 08:36:00] Lina's house | I knew she doted on Rino; when she saw that no utensils had been placed at Rino's seat, she immediately started to set them, but Lina stopped her.\n[1963-01-06 08:37:00] Lina's house | I saw my mother and daughter arguing, and then my brother appeared. Lina immediately threw a piece of coal at him.\n[1963-01-06 08:37:10] Lina's house | I saw Rino laugh and say it was a joke, just to cheer her up.\n[1963-01-06 08:37:20] Lina's house | I saw him grab Lina and try to hit her when he realized his sister was serious.\n[1963-01-06 08:38:00] Lina's House | I saw Fernando appear, still wearing his undershirt and shorts, holding a box in his hands.\n[1963-01-06 08:38:10] Lina's House | I heard him say, \"Look, the Epiphany witch brought me what kind of gift?\" I thought I could tell he was angry.\n[1963-01-06 08:38:20] Lina's house | I saw him take out the shoes that the two children had secretly made.\n[1963-01-06 08:38:30] Lina's house | I saw Lina's mouth open in surprise. I thought she was completely unaware, that Rino had decided on his own to present their work results to their father through the Epiphany gift.\n[1963-01-06 08:38:40] Lina's house | I saw her seeing the slight smile on her brother's face, mixed with a hint of worry, and she also saw her father's watchful, sharp gaze.\n[1963-01-06 08:38:50] Lina's house | I thought of her, and the scene of startling myself on the rooftop came back again, amidst the smoke and firecrackers, Rino lost his usual shape.\n[1963-01-06 08:39:00] Lina's House | I thought about how she was now facing a transformed brother, a brother who might become an irredeemable person.\n[1963-01-06 08:39:10] Lina's house | I thought of that smile, that look, in which she saw something repulsive and unbearable.\n[1963-01-06 08:39:20] Lina's house | I thought that even though she found it unbearable, she still continued to love her brother. She felt she needed to stand by his side, helping him and being helped by him.\n[1963-01-06 08:39:30] Lina's house | I heard Nunzia say, \"What a beautiful thing!\" I know she doesn't understand shoes at all.\n[1963-01-06 08:39:40] Lina's House | I saw Fernando say nothing, making an angry face, like the movie actor Randolph Scott.\n[1963-01-06 08:39:50] Lina's house | I saw him sit down, first putting on his right shoe, then his left.\n[1963-01-06 08:40:00] Lina's House | I heard him say, \"The Epiphany Witch,\" and then, \"It really was made for my feet.\"\n[1963-01-06 08:40:10] Lina's house | I saw him stand up and stretch, then walk back and forth in the kitchen under his family's gaze.\n[1963-01-06 08:40:20] Lina's house | I heard him say, \"It's really comfortable.\"\n[1963-01-06 08:40:30] Lina's House | I saw his wife looking at her son with a happy, excited gaze. I heard, \"These shoes are like those worn by a rich man.\"\n[1963-01-06 08:40:40] Lina's house | I saw Fernando sit down again, take off his shoes, and give them a thorough look top to bottom, inside and out.\n[1963-01-06 08:40:50] Lina's house | I heard him say, \"The person who made these shoes is a true master!\" I saw it, but I could tell his face was dark and showed no sign of joy.\n[1963-01-06 08:41:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Great, Epiphany Witch.\"\n[1963-01-06 08:41:10] Lina's house | I thought about every word he had said, and I could hear how terribly upset he was. The pain was about to burst forth, making him want to smash everything in front of him.\n[1963-01-06 08:41:20] Lina's House | I thought of it, but Rino didn't notice. Each of his father's sarcastic remarks made him feel increasingly proud.\n[1963-01-06 08:41:30] Lina's house | I saw him blushing, hesitating slightly, and smiling as he said, \"Dad, I added this, I was thinking...\"\n[1963-01-06 08:41:40] Lina's House | I thought of Lina wanting to leave the kitchen, wanting to escape her father's impending rage, but she couldn't make a decision; she didn't want to abandon her brother.\n[1963-01-06 08:42:00] Lina's house | I heard him say, \"These shoes are both light and durable. There's nothing that rubs your feet. Especially, I've never seen anyone else wear them. The toe is quite wide, which is quite fresh...\"\n[1963-01-06 08:42:10] Lina's house | I saw him sit down, put on his shoes, then undo them again.\n[1963-01-06 08:42:20] Lina's house | I heard him say to his son, \"Turn around, Rino, I'm about to thank the Epiphany Witch...\"\n[1963-01-06 08:42:30] Lina's House | I thought that Rino saw this as a joke, which might finally put an end to their conflicts and arguments. He turned around, feeling a bit happy and also embarrassed.\n[1963-01-06 08:42:40] Lina's house | I saw him just turn around when my father kicked his butt hard from behind, calling him a beast and a bastard!\n[1963-01-06 08:42:50] Lina's house | I saw my father throw everything within reach at him, and finally even his shoes.\n[1963-01-06 08:43:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina get involved at the end, because she saw her brother initially just dodging their father's punches and kicks, but later he also started shouting.\n[1963-01-06 08:43:10] Lina's house | I saw him knock the chair over, break the plates, and start crying loudly, saying he would rather die than work for his father for free.\n[1963-01-06 08:43:20] Lina's house | I saw my mother, several of my brothers and sisters, and the neighbors all filled with fear, but it didn't matter—my father and son both needed to let off some steam.\n[1963-01-06 09:30:00] Lina's house | I saw them exhaust all their strength, then go to work together without saying a word, bowing their heads in despair as they worked in that run-down shop.\n[1963-01-07 08:00:00] Lina's house | I knew for a while, no one mentioned those shoes.\n[1963-01-07 08:00:10] Lina's House | I saw Lina make up her mind: her job was to help her mother with housework, go shopping, cook, wash clothes, and hang them out to dry. She would never go to the shoe repair shop again.\n[1963-01-07 08:00:20] Lina's House | I thought of Rino becoming very sad, his face drawn, believing it was his sister's revenge against him, and therefore found it hard to understand.\n[1963-01-07 08:00:30] Lina's House | I thought about how he had begun to expect his sister to neatly fold the clean socks, underpants, and shirts and place them in his drawer, showing him respect and taking care of him after he got home from work.\n[1963-01-07 19:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that if anything didn't suit him, he would protest, saying things like: \"You can't even iron a shirt, you idiot!\"\n[1963-01-07 19:00:10] Lina's house | I saw her shrug her shoulders, say nothing, and continue diligently with her task.\n[1963-01-13 09:00:00] Lina's house | I thought of Rino, who certainly wasn't satisfied with this attitude. He struggled to calm down, trying hard to return to his former self.\n[1963-01-13 09:00:10] Lina's house | On good weather days, like Sunday mornings, he would tease Lina, speaking in a beggarly tone: \"You're angry with me because I said those shoes were made by me alone?\"\n[1963-01-13 09:00:20] Lina's house | \"I said, 'But I did it,' lying, 'to prevent dad from getting angry at you.'\"\n[1963-01-13 09:00:30] Lina's house | I would then beg her: \"Help me! What should we do now? We can't stop. I have to get out of this situation.\"\n[1963-01-13 09:00:40] Lina's house | I saw Lina say nothing, she cooked, ironed clothes, and once she even kissed her brother's cheek, showing that she was no longer angry.",

She'll eventually marry some scumbag and leave this place, leaving him to continue living a miserable life alone.\n[1963-01-15 15:00:00] Lina's House | I once saw that when no one was home, Lina came into the small room where the shoes were hidden. She took out the shoes and examined them carefully.\n[1963-01-15 15:00:10] Lina's House | I thought about looking at those shoes, and even I found it strange: according to a drawing in the notebook, these shoes were finally made, whether good or bad, it had taken a lot of effort!\n[1963-01-20 10:00:00] School | I knew that for the rest of the semester, Lina had completely lost interest in my studies at school. I thought exactly that.\n[1963-01-20 10:00:10] Street | I saw her when I asked her what books she had borrowed from the library and what she was reading. I heard her answer impatiently, \"I didn't borrow any books, reading gives me a headache.\"\n[1963-02-15 16:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that I had been learning all along. I thought that for me, reading was almost a pleasure.\n[1963-02-15 16:00:10] School | I realized that soon I would find out that when Lina no longer followed me closely, surpassing me in study and reading, school and Professor Ferraro's library had ceased to be an adventure and had become something I was very good at.\n[1963-02-15 16:00:20] School | I know I have received a lot of encouragement and praise. I thought of two things that made me very clearly aware of this.\n[1963-02-20 11:00:00] Library | I remember once, I was holding my library card. I saw that it was filled with records of borrowed and returned books.\n[1963-02-20 11:00:10] Library | I saw the teacher first praised my perseverance, then asked about Lina.\n[1963-02-20 11:00:20] Library | I heard him say that Lina and her family no longer borrow books, and he felt sorry about it. I couldn't understand why, but the teacher's expression of regret was really painful.\n[1963-02-20 11:00:30] Library | I thought to myself that this regret came from a deep interest in Lina, which was far stronger than his praise and encouragement towards me.\n[1963-02-20 11:00:40] Library | I thought that even if Lina borrowed only one book a year, she would leave her mark on it, and when she returned it, the teacher would feel the trace she had left.\n[1963-02-20 11:00:50] Library | I think about it, but I won't leave any marks in the book. I'm just an obstinate reader, reading one book after another, without any pattern, swallowing them whole.\n[1963-03-01 10:00:00] Classroom | I also know another thing has to do with school homework.\n[1963-03-01 10:00:10] Classroom | I saw the Chinese teacher correct our essays and hand them back to us. I thought about how I still remember the essay topic at that time — \"The Tragic Stages of Queen Dido.\"\n[1963-03-01 10:00:20] Classroom | I know that usually he just says a few words, explaining why I got an eight or a nine.\n[1963-03-01 10:00:30] Classroom | I saw that time, he praised me in a very specific way in class. Only at the end did he mention my score, and he gave me a perfect mark.\n[1963-03-01 10:50:00] School corridor | I saw him calling me in the hallway when class was over. I heard that he really appreciated the way I analyzed problems.\n[1963-03-01 10:50:10] School corridor | When I saw the religious teacher, I stopped him too, enthusiastically talking about my progress in my studies.\n[1963-03-03 09:00:00] School | I realized that a few days later, and I found out that Teacher Girace hadn't only let the religious education teacher read my essay, but also other teachers, even some who had never taught me.\n[1963-03-03 09:00:10] School corridor | I saw some senior teachers smiling at me in the hallway, and sometimes they even praised me with a few words.\n[1963-03-05 12:00:00] School courtyard | I know, for example, a female teacher from Class A, Teacher Galiani, who is loved by everyone.\n[1963-03-05 12:00:10] School courtyard | I know, but everyone avoids her because she's an acknowledged communist, and with just a few words she can dismantle someone's argument that isn'tstrictly enough.\n[1963-03-05 12:00:20] School courtyard | I saw her stop me in the schoolyard.\n[1963-03-05 12:00:30] School courtyard | I saw how passionate she was about the main idea I expressed in my essay.\n[1963-03-05 12:00:40] School courtyard | I know that love can no longer exist in the city, the very nature of the city has changed, from good to evil.\n[1963-03-05 12:00:50] School courtyard | I heard her ask me, \"What does a city without love mean to you?\"\n[1963-03-05 12:00:55] School courtyard | I heard, \"people who mean losing happiness.\"\n[1963-03-05 12:01:00] School courtyard | \"I heard 'For example.'\"\n[1963-03-05 12:01:05] School courtyard | I thought about my discussions with Lina and Pasquale throughout the entire month of September.\n[1963-03-05 12:01:10] School courtyard | I thought that was the real school, more like a real school than the one I went to every day.\n[1963-03-05 12:01:15] School courtyard | I heard, \"Italy under Fascist, Germany under the Nazis, today all the people of the world.\"\n[1963-03-05 12:01:25] School courtyard | I saw her looking at me with interest. I heard that my essay was good, and she recommended a book to me, saying she would lend me her book.\n[1963-03-05 12:01:35] School courtyard | I heard her ask me at the end, \"What does your father do for a living?\" I replied, \"He's the gatekeeper at the city hall.\"\n[1963-03-05 12:01:40] School courtyard | I saw her walk away with her head down.\n[1963-03-05 12:10:00] School | I thought, of course, about Professor Galiani's interest in me, which made me proud, but nothing came of it, and everything returned to normal.\n[1963-03-05 12:10:10] School | I thought about how I became a fairly well-known and outstanding student in my first year of high school, but in the end, it didn't really matter.\n[1963-03-05 12:10:20] School | What does this reveal about the situation?\n[1963-03-05 12:10:30] School | I wondered if this was only proof of how beneficial it had been for me to study and talk with Lina.\n[1963-03-05 12:10:40] School | I thought that, encouraged and supported by her, I could bravely step out of the world beyond our Mergellina, break through the situation, and experience for myself the ideas, landscapes, characters, and events written in the books.\n[1963-03-05 12:10:50] School | I thought, of course, I told myself, the analysis of Queen Dido was mine, expressing those events with elegant phrases was my specialty, but the views I wrote about Dido did not belong to me.\n[1963-03-05 12:11:00] School | I thought of the composition—wasn't it written together with her?\n[1963-03-05 12:11:10] School | I thought about how we stimulated each other, how our passion burned together—wasn't that how it was?\n[1963-03-05 12:11:20] School | I thought about the idea that there's no love in the city, which the teacher so appreciated, but wasn't that Lina's view?\n[1963-03-05 12:11:30] School | I thought, although I had expressed this idea in my own words, what conclusion could I possibly draw from these events?\n[1963-03-15 10:00:00] Classroom | I thought about how I had started looking forward to getting praised for an essay I had written on my own.\n[1963-03-20 10:00:00] Classroom | I saw Professor Gerace assigning another homework essay on the Queen of Carthage— \"Aeneas and Queen Dido: The Encounter of Two Exiles.\"\n[1963-03-25 10:00:00] Classroom | I saw him read my essay, and he wasn't moved at all—he gave me an eight.",

I would meet him when I entered and left the school gate.\n[1963-03-30 14:00:10] At the school gate | I saw that he never once looked at me. I always saw him looking very focused.\n[1963-04-05 14:00:00] Street | I once even followed him all the way to Garibaldi Street and then to Casanova Street.\n[1963-04-05 14:10:00] Street | I thought, I wish he could see me and say, \"Hello, we're going the same way. I've often heard people talk about you.\"\n[1963-04-05 14:20:00] Street | I saw him, but he was walking quickly, his head down, never looking back.\n[1963-04-05 14:30:00] Street | I saw myself turning back, dejected, onto Via Novara, heading home. I thought I felt tired, and I looked down on myself.\n[1963-04-10 16:00:00] Home | I know that days just pass like this, and I am proving my determination and effort to my teacher, my classmates, and myself. I felt a growing sense of loneliness within me, and I felt that I lacked motivation when studying.\n[1963-04-10 17:00:00] Street | I told Lina about Professor Ferraro's regret and asked her to keep going to the library to borrow books. I told her about the recognition my essay on Dido had received, I didn't specify what I had written, but I made it clear that it was her success.\n[1963-04-10 17:05:00] Street | I saw her getting impatient as I spoke. I thought she might have forgotten the character of Queen Dido, and what we had both said about her, since she now had other issues to deal with.\n[1963-04-10 17:10:00] Street | I heard her say, whenever she had a chance, that Marcello hadn't accepted reality as Pasquale had; he was still chasing her.\n[1963-04-10 17:10:10] Street | When I saw her going out to do some shopping, he would follow her all the way to Stefano's shop, to Enzo's carriage, just watching her without disturbing her.\n[1963-04-10 17:10:20] Street | I saw that if she leaned out of the window, she would see him standing at the corner of the street, waiting for her to show her face.\n[1963-04-10 17:10:30] Street | I know her father noticed as well, especially Rino did. I can't help feeling anxious about this.\n[1963-04-10 17:10:40] Street | I know that such things are common in the place where we live, Mergellina. I thought she was worried that the several men might start fighting each other.\n[1963-04-10 17:10:50] Street | I heard her say, \"What exactly do I have?\" She looked thin and ugly, why was Marcello so obsessed with her? \"Am I the problem? Am I making people do the wrong things?\"\n[1963-04-12 17:00:00] Street | I saw her constantly saying similar things. I thought that I was increasingly certain that the harm I brought to my brother far outweighed any benefit.\n[1963-04-12 17:00:10] Street | I heard her say, \"You can tell just by looking at him—he's lost his mind over building the Lina factory.\"\n[1963-04-12 17:00:20] Street | I thought about how he was completely obsessed with becoming as rich as the Solara brothers, as wealthy as Stefano, even richer than them, and he couldn't stand working in the shop every day.\n[1963-04-12 17:00:30] Street | I saw him trying to rekindle Lina's previous passion, and he said to Lina. I heard, \"We're smart. Lina, between the two of us, no one can catch up. Tell me, what should we do?\"\n[1963-04-12 17:00:40] Street | I know he also wanted to buy a car and a television. Fernando didn't understand the importance of these things, which made me very angry.\n[1963-04-12 17:00:50] Street | I saw that especially when Lina showed she no longer wanted to support him, Rino's attitude became very harsh, and he treated her even more brutally than a servant.\n[1963-04-12 17:01:00] Street | I thought maybe he didn't even know he was ruined. Lina faced her brother every day and worried about it.\n[1963-04-12 17:01:10] Street | I once heard her say to me, \"Have you ever seen someone just waking up, looking very ugly, their whole face distorted, and their eyes vacant?\"\n[1963-04-12 17:01:20] Street | I thought that she saw Rino as having become just like that.\n[1963-04-14 19:00:00] Street | I know it was a Sunday evening in mid-April, and I remember that time we all went out together: me, Lina, Carmela, Pasquale, and Rino.\n[1963-04-14 19:10:00] Street | I saw that we girls wanted to dress nicely, so we put on lipstick and outlined our eyes as soon as we stepped outside.\n[1963-05-01 08:00:00] Lina's house | I saw it, but Rino didn't back down. In the following days, he either beat or scolded his sister.\n[1963-05-05 16:00:00] Street | I see that every time I meet Lina, I see new [physical violence] on her body.\n[1963-05-10 08:00:00] Street | I saw one morning that Rino asked her to go with him to the shoemaker's shop. I thought that after some time, I felt she had given in.\n[1963-05-10 08:10:00] Street | I saw them walking on the road, all of them trying to find a way to end the struggle.\n[1963-05-10 08:10:10] Street | I heard Rino tell her that he loved Lina, but Lina loved no one, neither her parents nor her brothers.\n[1963-05-10 08:10:20] Street | I heard Lina whisper, \"How do you love? What is the nature of our family's love? Tell me about it.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:10:30] Street | I listened to their conversation for a while, and finally he said his piece: \"If Marcello likes those shoes, Father will change his mind.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:10:40] Street | I heard, \"I don't think so.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:10:50] Street | I heard, \"I'm sure. If Marcello buys those shoes, Dad will realize your design is good and can make money, and he'll let us start making them.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:11:00] Street | I heard, \"Just the three of us?\"\n[1963-05-10 08:11:10] Street | I heard, \"Me and him, and if possible, you too. Dad can make a pair of shoes in four days, at most five.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:11:20] Street | I heard her say, \"If I try my best, I can make a pair in four or five days. Let's make a few pairs of shoes and sell them, use the money to buy materials again, then make a few more pairs and sell them to get funds.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:11:30] Street | I heard, \"Who are we going to sell the shoes to? Sell them to Marcello?\"\n[1963-05-10 08:11:40] Street | I heard, \"The Solara brothers sell a lot of things, they know people, they can do advertising for us.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:11:50] Street | I heard, \"Are they giving us free advertising?\"\n[1963-05-10 08:12:00] Street | I heard, \"If they want a commission, we can give them a little.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:12:10] Street | I heard, \"Why are they satisfied with just a small commission?\"\n[1963-05-10 08:12:20] Street | I heard, \"Now our relationship is solid.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:12:30] Street | I heard, \"You and the Solara brothers?\"\n[1963-05-10 08:12:40] Street | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:12:50] Street | I saw Lina sigh and say. I heard, \"Well, I'll go tell my father about this and see what he thinks.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:13:00] Street | I heard, \"You dare!\"\n[1963-05-10 08:13:10] Street | I heard, \"Well, then.\"\n[1963-05-10 08:13:20] Street | I saw Rino saying nothing. I thought he was very annoyed.\n[1963-05-10 08:13:30] Street | I heard, \"Well, anyway, you speak first, because you're better at talking.\"",

I heard, \"This is what I said, not what Marcello said.\"\n[1963-05-10 20:00:40] Lina's House | I saw Fernando looking at his wife. I thought Lina understood that her parents had already talked about it and had made a secret decision.\n[1963-05-10 20:01:00] Lina's house | \"I heard 'Tomorrow,' he said, 'I'll put the shoes you made in the shop window. If anyone wants to look at them, try them on, or wants to buy them, whatever the hell they want to do, they have to talk to me. I'm in charge of this.'\"\n[1963-05-15 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I had seen it a few days earlier, and now I passed by Lina's shop.\n[1963-05-15 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino working, and Fernando was working too; both had their heads down, their backs bent.\n[1963-05-15 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw a pair of \"Lina\" shoes, very elegant and beautiful, among the colorful boxes and shoelaces in the window display.\n[1963-05-15 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw a sign stuck to the glass, clearly made by Rino, which ostentatiously read: \"Selling 'Lina' brand shoes.\"\n[1963-05-15 10:00:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw the father and son both waiting for good fortune to come.\n[1963-05-15 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw it, but Lina was full of suspicion; she frowned.\n[1963-05-15 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought she didn't believe her brother's naive speculation at all, and she was worried about the secret agreement her parents had reached. She was waiting for something bad to happen.\n[1963-05-22 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that a week had passed, and no one—not even Marcello—showed any interest in the shoes in the window.\n[1963-05-22 17:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that, under Rino's prompting, Marcello was almost forcibly pulled into the shop. He took a look at the shoes. I thought of him, but his mind was elsewhere.\n[1963-05-22 17:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw, of course, he tried them on his feet. I heard him say that the shoes were a bit tight.\n[1963-05-22 17:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him take off his shoes and disappear quickly, saying not a single compliment, as if he had a stomachache and rushed home immediately.\n[1963-05-22 17:02:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw both the father and son were disappointed, but two minutes later, Marcello appeared again.\n[1963-05-22 17:02:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino suddenly jump up, he cheered and immediately grabbed Marcello's hand, as if they had arranged to meet.\n[1963-05-22 17:02:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw but Marcello pretended not to see him, and walked straight up to Fernando, speaking to him in one breath. I heard, \"I have a serious matter to discuss with you, Don Fernando. I want to marry your daughter Lina.\"\n[1963-05-25 00:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that Rino had a high fever for several days as he dealt with the change of events, and he didn't go to work for several consecutive days.\n[1963-05-30 02:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that later he suddenly stopped having a fever, but he had some astonishing behaviors: getting up from his bed in the middle of the night, eyes closed, still continuing to sleep.\n[1963-05-30 02:00:10] Lina's house | I saw him silent and very agitated, walking toward the door, wanting to open it, he opened his eyes and opened the door.\n[1963-05-30 02:00:20] Lina's house | I saw Nunzia and Lina were scared, and they pulled him back into bed.\n[1963-05-30 10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Fernando; he and his wife had already understood Marcello's real intention from the beginning. He calmly told his daughter about it.\n[1963-05-30 10:00:10] Lina's House | I saw him explain that the marriage between her and Marcello was not only important for her future, but also for the entire family.\n[1963-05-30 10:00:20] Lina's house | I saw him say that she was still a child, and as a father, he advised her to accept the arrangement, suggesting they could get engaged first, and over time she would get used to it.\n[1963-05-30 10:00:30] Lina's house | I saw Lina answer in the same calm tone, saying she would rather drown in the pond than get engaged to or marry Marcello.\n[1963-05-30 10:00:40] Lina's house | I saw them arguing fiercely, but she had already made up her mind.\n[1963-05-31 16:00:00] Street | I thought about how shocked I was upon hearing the news. I understood that Marcello was determined to be with Lina at any cost, but I had never imagined that someone had already formally proposed to Lina at our age.\n[1963-05-31 16:00:10] Street | I know she's not yet fifteen, and she's never had a boyfriend in secret, never been intimate with anyone, yet someone has already proposed to her.\n[1963-05-31 16:00:20] Street | I saw that I was about to support her decision.\n[1963-05-31 16:00:30] Street | Do I want to get married? With Marcello? And have [childbearing status]? No, absolutely not!\n[1963-05-31 16:00:40] Street | I saw myself encouraging her to rebel against her father, vowing I would support her.\n[1963-06-05 10:00:00] Lina's House | I saw her father, who had now lost his patience and was threatening her.\n[1963-06-05 10:00:10] Lina's house | I heard him say it was all for her own good, that if she didn't agree to marry such an important man, he would break her legs.\n[1963-07-08T09:00:00] Vomero | I saw that we boarded Vomero in the second week of July. I know Stefano and Lina, Rino and Pinochia, Nunzia, and me.\n[1963-07-08T09:05:00] Vomero | I saw two men carrying luggage, like two ancient heroes appearing in a strange place, and they were very alert.\n[1963-07-08T09:05:05] Vomero | I thought about how it was inconvenient for them that they didn't have a car here, and how it made them unhappy that they had to get up early and give up their weekend habit of sleeping in.\n[1963-07-08T09:05:10] Vomero | I saw that all their wives were dressed as if for a festival. I was thinking, but we were all angry for different reasons: Pinocchia was angry because Rino carried all the luggage by himself and didn't show her enough care; Lina was angry because Stefano pretended to know what to do and how to go, but in fact he didn't know anything at all.\n[1963-07-08T09:05:15] Vomero | I saw that as for Nunzia, she spoke and acted very carefully so as not to make the young people dislike her. I saw her, looking as if she felt she was unnecessary, an eyesore to others.\n[1963-07-08T09:05:20] Vomero | I saw a bag on my shoulder, containing my things. The only person who was truly happy was me. The smell, sound, and color of Vomero immediately excited me, and as soon as I stepped off the boat, all the memories from a few years ago came rushing back to me.\n[1963-07-08T09:15:00] Vomero | I saw the three of us squeeze into two motor tricycles, all of us carrying luggage and drenched in sweat.\n[1963-07-08T10:00:00] Rentals | I knew the house had been hastily rented, arranged by a Vomero person who was a sausage supplier for Capodimonte. It was located on a road leading to Guaoto, and it was a modest house, belonging to the cousin of the sausage supplier.\n[1963-07-08T10:05:00] Rentals | I saw the landlord was a very thin woman in her sixties, never married, who greeted us briefly and efficiently.\n[1963-07-08T10:10:00] Rentals | I saw Stefano and Rino dragging their luggage up a very narrow staircase, joking and cursing their miserable task.\n[1963-07-08T10:15:00] Rentals | I saw the landlord lead us into a very dim room. I saw the inside filled with religious icons and small lamps.\n[1963-07-08T10:15:05] Renting House | I saw her open the window. I saw that on the other side of the main road was a pine forest, and behind the palm trees and the pine forest was a beach.\n[1963-07-08T10:20:00] Renting House | I watched them argue for a while. One said, \"Your room is bigger,\" and the other replied, \"Yours is bigger!\" I know, or rather, the bedroom of Pinocchio and Lina faces the sea.\n[1963-07-08T10:25:00] Rentals | I saw that the room assigned to Nunzia had a small skylight on the ceiling, which offered almost no view, while the room assigned to me was extremely tiny, so cramped that fitting a bed in was a struggle. It faced a chicken coop and a quiet little bamboo grove.\n[1963-07-08T12:00:00] Restaurant | I saw, under the landlord's guidance, we arrived at a dark and dingy restaurant, which was empty except for us. I saw that there was nothing to eat there.\n[1963-07-08T12:30:00] Restaurant | I saw us sitting down hesitantly. I thought, but in reality, even Nunzia found the food there delicious.\n[1963-07-08T13:00:00] Restaurant | I saw her later even trying to pack some food, preparing for dinner at night. I knew she had always been skeptical about food outside her own kitchen.\n[1963-07-08T13:30:00] Restaurant | After eating, Stefano showed no intention of paying the bill. After lingering for a while, Rino finally paid the money.\n[1963-07-08T13:40:00] Traveling | I saw that, and we girls all suggested going to the beach, but the two boys didn't want to. They yawned and said they were too tired.\n[1963-07-08T13:45:00] Traveling | I saw that all of us girls were holding on, especially Lina, Nunzia, and the two men who thought alike, so we all went home. I heard Lina say, \"We ate too much; a walk would do us good. The beach is below, Mom, can you walk?\"\n[1963-07-08T14:30:00] Renting house | After walking around the room a few times, Stefano and Rino became very impatient and almost in unison said they wanted to take a nap.\n[1963-07-08T14:35:00] Rentals | I saw them laughing, biting each other's ears for a while, then laughing again, and they gestured to their respective wives. I saw the two of them reluctantly entering the room.\n[1963-07-08T15:00:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia and spent about two hours alone with her. I looked at the kitchen and we both thought it was pretty dirty.\n[1963-07-08T15:10:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia busily scrubbing away, carefully washing everything: plates, cups, knives and forks, and pots. I also had to help her from the side.",

    "text": "[1963-07-08T16:00:00] Renting House | I saw her reminding me to immediately ask the landlord for some things that were missing. I heard her say that she was afraid she'd forget if she turned her head, and told me to remember well. She sighed and said, \"That's why you've always been so good at school.\"\n[1963-07-08T17:00:00] Rentals | I saw the two couples appear again, first Stefano and Lina, then Rino and Pinochia.\n[1963-07-08T17:30:00] Rentals | I saw myself suggesting again that we go to the beach, but everyone was drinking coffee, joking, and chatting, and no one paid any attention.\n[1963-07-08T18:00:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia start cooking, and Pinocchia was tightly clinging to Rino. I heard her say, on one hand, that he should listen to the baby's heartbeat, and on the other, she whispered, \"Don't leave tomorrow morning.\"\n[1963-07-08T19:00:00] Rentals | I saw the last two men were very anxious, worried they'd miss the last boat. They complained they hadn't taken a car and ran off to find someone to drive them to the harbor, leaving without saying a word. I thought about how time had slipped away like that, and still, no one had gone to the sea.\n[1963-07-08T19:10:00] Rentals | I watched the several of us girls silently taking things out of our luggage, each of us getting settled, while Nunzia was enthusiastically cleaning the bathroom. I saw Pinocchio's tears welling up.\n[1963-07-08T20:00:00] Rentals | I thought about how we felt relieved only after being sure that the two men hadn't missed the last boat, hadn't turned back, and then we started to joke around.\n[1963-07-08T22:00:00] Rentals | I heard Pinocchio say she was scared. \"There's a picture of the Virgin Mary in the room, her face full of pain, with several daggers in her heart. Under a small lamp, the daggers were shining.\" I knew that for a whole week, we had no other responsibility besides taking care of ourselves.\n[1963-07-08T23:00:00] Rentals | I saw that she didn't want to be alone in the room, so she went to sleep with Lina. I locked myself in that small room. I thought about enjoying the secret of my heart: Nino was at Mergellina, not too far from here, and maybe tomorrow I would meet him on the beach.\n[1963-07-08T23:10:00] Rentals | I thought to myself that I must be crazy, reckless, but I liked that state; a part of me was tired of people who always followed the rules.\n[1963-07-08T23:30:00] Rentals | I noticed the weather was hot, so I opened the window. I heard the hens clucking and the reeds rustling. Later, I realized there were mosquitoes, and I quickly closed the window.\n[1963-07-09T00:30:00] Renting House | I saw that I had spent at least an hour beating those mosquitoes with a book that Teacher Galiani had lent me. I knew it was a book about theater, written by a writer named Beckett.\n[1963-07-09T00:35:00] Renting House | I didn't want Nino to see me covered in pimples, all swollen from mosquito bites, and I didn't want him to see me reading a book about theater, which was a field I had never even touched.\n[1963-07-09T01:00:00] Rentals | I saw that I had placed Beckett aside. I saw the book covered with black mosquito corpses and red blood.\n[1963-07-09T01:10:00] Rentals | I saw myself beginning to read a book about the idea of the nation. I thought the book was hard to understand, and I fell asleep quickly.\n[1963-07-09T08:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that in the morning, Nunzia felt it was her duty to take care of us, so she went to the store to buy food, while we went to Cetara Beach.\n[1963-07-09T09:00:00] Chitala Beach | I knew, but during that long holiday, we always thought the place was called \"Cetara.\"\n[1963-07-09T10:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw Lina and Pinocchia take off their swimsuits. I really like their swimsuits; they're all one-piece.\n[1963-07-09T10:05:00] Chitala Beach | I knew that before we were married, as a boyfriend, Stefano allowed Lina to wear a bikini, but after we married, both husbands unilaterally opposed the bikini.\n[1963-07-09T10:10:00] Chitara Beach | I saw them in their one-piece swimsuits, the new fabric was very bright in color, the cut at the chest and waist clung closely to their skin, very elegant and fashionable.\n[1963-07-09T10:15:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that under my old sky-blue long-sleeved dress, I was still wearing that faded swimsuit, which had become loose and shapeless. I knew it was made by Nella, the landlord, several years ago in Balano.\n[1963-07-09T10:20:00] Chitara Beach | I saw myself reluctantly taking off my dress. We walked in the sun for a long time, all the way to a place where hot water was bubbling up, and then we walked back.\n[1963-07-09T11:00:00] Chitala Beach | I swam many times with Pinocchio, but Lina never got in the water. I know that although she had come specifically to swim.\n[1963-07-09T12:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that Nino wasn't there. I thought I naturally felt sad, but I was sure he would appear before me like a miracle.\n[1963-07-09T18:00:00] Seaside | After I saw the two of them go home, I stayed behind on the beach and walked toward Mergellina along the shore. I saw the night, my whole body was scorching hot, feeling like I had a high fever. There were blisters on my shoulders.\n[1963-07-10T09:00:00] Rentals | I knew I had to stay home for the next few days, so I cleaned diligently, cooked, and read, which moved Nunzia deeply; she kept praising me nonstop.\n[1963-07-12T20:00:00] Mergellina | I said every night that I was staying home during the day to avoid the sun, and I had Lina and Pinocchia accompany me on a walk to Mergellina.\n[1963-07-12T20:30:00] Mergellina | I saw us loitering in the center of town, eating ice cream. I knew it was a long way.\n[1963-07-12T21:00:00] Mergellina | I heard Pinocchio complain, \"This place is really beautiful! Our home is as boring as a tomb.\" I thought about it, but for me, Mergellina was also a tomb, and I still hadn't seen Nino.\n[1963-07-13T19:00:00] Rentals | I knew their husbands had arrived even earlier; they had expected them to come on Sunday morning, but they showed up on Saturday night.\n[1963-07-13T19:05:00] Renting house | I saw that they were all very happy, each of them riding a \"Lametta\" motorcycle. I know it might have been rented at the harbor in Vomero.\n[1963-07-13T20:00:00] Renting house | I saw Nunzia preparing a very lavish dinner. I heard them talking about Mergellina, the store, and the production of new shoes.\n[1963-07-13T20:30:00] Rentals | I saw Rino boasting about the shoe designs he was finishing with his father, but he found some suitable moments to show Lina a few sketches.\n[1963-07-13T20:35:00] Renting house | I saw Lina looking reluctantly, and she gave him some suggestions.\n[1963-07-13T21:00:00] Rentals | I saw us sitting at the table eating, two young men who finished everything, competing to see who could eat more.\n[1963-07-13T21:50:00] Rentals | I saw that it wasn't even ten o'clock yet, and they were already dragging their wives into the bedroom.\n[1963-07-13T22:00:00] Rentals | I saw myself helping Nunzia clear the dishes, doing the washing up, and then locking myself in the room to read for a while.\n[1963-07-13T22:30:00] Rentals | I saw that the weather was extremely hot and stuffy. I thought about how worried I was about mosquitoes getting in, so I didn't open the window.\n[1963-07-13T23:00:00] Rentals | I saw myself tossing and turning in bed, drenched in sweat. I thought about how Lina had gradually given in.\n[1963-07-13T23:05:00] Rentals | I thought about how she showed no emotion toward her husband. Before they were married, sometimes her gestures still carried a hint of tenderness, but now there was nothing left.\n[1963-07-13T23:10:00] Rentals | I thought about dinner in the evening, when she often used some very harsh words to describe Stefano eating greedily and drinking in a disgusting way. But clearly, there was already a balance between them, even though it could be broken at any moment, it had still reached a kind of balance.\n[1963-07-13T23:15:00] Renting House | I saw that in the end he said a few suggestive words, then walked into the room, and Lina followed him in without delay, without saying \"you go first, I'll come later.\" I thought she had finally bowed to an inescapable convention.\n[1963-07-13T23:20:00] Renting House | I thought that between her and her husband there was no sensual joy like that which Rino and Pinocchia showed, but there was also no resistance.\n[1963-07-14T01:00:00] Renting House | I ended up falling asleep. I stayed up until late at night, and I kept hearing the sounds of the two couples— their laughter and moans, the sound of doors opening, the faucet turning on, the sound of flushing, and then the door closing again.\n[1963-07-14T09:00:00] Renting House | I saw that on a Sunday morning, I had breakfast with Nunzia.",

I went back home.\n[1963-07-14T12:35:00] Rentals | I heard Nunzia tell me that the four of them had gone around the island on a \"Lametta\" motorcycle, so we didn't need to wait for them for lunch.\n[1963-07-14T15:00:00] Rentals | I saw them come back at three. I saw them all bright-eyed and cheerful, their faces red from the sun.\n[1963-07-14T15:05:00] Renting House | I saw four people showing great enthusiasm for Casamiro, Lacco Ameno, and Mergellina.\n[1963-07-14T15:05:05] Renting House | I saw, especially the two women, who immediately turned to me with looks full of malice. I saw light in their eyes.\n[1963-07-14T15:05:10] Renting House | I saw Pinocchio almost shouting. I heard, \"Elena! Guess what happened.\"  \n\"What happened?\"  \n\"We met Nino by the sea,\" Lina said.\n[1963-07-14T15:05:15] Rentals | I heard \"Oh...\" I thought my heart was going to stop.\n[1963-07-14T15:05:20] Rentals | I saw Pinocchio speaking very excitedly, dramatically swinging his arms. I heard, \"Oh my God! He swims really well.\"\n[1963-07-14T15:05:25] Rentals | I heard Rino say, \"He's not that bad, he's interested in how to make shoes.\"\n[1963-07-14T15:05:30] Renting house | I heard Stefano say, \"He has a friend named Socavo, the Socavo who makes pork and beef sausages. His father is a big boss, and he owns a factory in Stazione Centrale.\"\n[1963-07-14T15:05:35] Rentals | I heard Rino say again, \"That's a real rich person.\"\n[1963-07-14T15:05:40] Rentals | I heard Stefano go on: \"Don't look for that poor student, Elena. He has no money at all. You should set your sights on Soccavo—it would be better for you.\"\n[1963-07-14T15:10:00] Rentals | I watched them exchange some more jokes (you know, Elena is now the richest among us, she looks like a good girl, but actually...), and then the four of them once again went back to their respective rooms.\n[1963-07-14T15:15:00] Renting House | I thought about how sad I was, that they had met Nino, swam with him, talked with him, and they hadn't invited me.\n[1963-07-14T15:30:00] Rentals | I saw myself wearing my best dress — the one I wore at Lina's wedding, even though it was very hot. I saw myself carefully combing my hair, and after basking in the sun, my hair had turned golden.\n[1963-07-14T15:35:00] Rental Apartment | I told Nunzia I was going out for a walk.\n[1963-07-14T16:30:00] Mergellina | I saw myself walking to Mergellina. I felt anxious when walking alone, because of the heat and because of the unknown outcome.\n[1963-07-14T16:35:00] Nino's friend's house downstairs | I saw myself arriving at the house where Nino's friend lived. I stood on the street, calling out several times with great nervousness, worried that no one would answer. I heard \"Nino! Nino!\"\n[1963-07-14T16:35:10] Nino's friend's house downstairs | I saw his face. I heard, \"Come up.\"  \n\"I'm waiting for you here.\"\n[1963-07-14T16:36:00] Nino's friend's house downstairs | I saw myself waiting for him below. I thought about how I was worried he might not be kind to me.\n[1963-07-14T16:38:00] Nino's friend's house downstairs | I saw him come out through the small door. I saw a rare kind of passion on his face.\n[1963-07-14T16:38:05] Nino's friend's house downstairs | I was captivated by the sharp, angular features of his face, his tall figure, broad shoulders, narrow chest, tight skin, and thin body, which seemed to consist only of muscle, bone, and sinew. I felt a sense of pleasure when he appeared before me.\n[1963-07-14T16:40:00] Town Center | I saw him say that his friend would join us later, and we walked to the center of Mergellina town. I saw there was a weekend market, with many vendors setting up their stalls.\n[1963-07-14T16:45:00] Town Center | I heard him ask me how the job at Mazzucchelli's bookstore turned out later.  \nI said that Lina had asked me to accompany her on vacation, so I quit.\n[1963-07-14T16:45:05] Town Center | I thought about the fact that I hadn't mentioned the money she gave me, and accompanying her felt like a job, like I was one of her employees.\n[1963-07-14T16:46:00] Town Center | I heard myself asking him about Nadia, and he just said, \"Everything's fine.\"  \n\"Do you write to each other?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Do you write every day?\"  \n\"Every week.\"\n[1963-07-14T16:47:00] Town Center | I thought about how this was our conversation back then, and by now there was nothing left to say. I thought we didn't understand each other at all.\n[1963-07-14T16:47:05] Town Center | I thought maybe I should ask how his relationship with his father was, but what tone should I use? Besides, I had already seen with my own eyes that their relationship wasn't good at all.\n[1963-07-14T16:47:10] Town Center | I saw that we fell into silence. I thought I felt embarrassed.\n[1963-07-14T16:48:00] Town Center | I saw it, but he immediately shifted the topic to the only area that could make our meeting seem legitimate. He said he was glad to see me, and he and his friends could only talk about football and exams.\n[1963-07-14T16:49:00] Town Center | I saw him start to praise me. I heard him say that Professor Galiani had good eyesight, that I was the only girl in the school who was curious about knowledge beyond the exams.\n[1963-07-14T16:50:00] Town Center | I saw him talking about those very important issues, and we immediately began speaking in a very formal, elegant, and passionate Italian. I thought that by doing so, we could express what we wanted to say more effectively.\n[1963-07-14T16:55:00] Town Center | I saw him first address the issue of violence, mentioning a peaceful demonstration in Cortona, then skillfully linking that demonstration to a fight that had taken place in Turin Square. He said he wanted to better understand the relationship between immigration and industrial development.\n[1963-07-14T16:55:05] Town Center | I saw that I expressed my agreement. What do I know about these things? I know absolutely nothing.\n[1963-07-14T16:56:00] Town Center | I saw that Nino had noticed, and he told me in detail about the uprising of young people from southern Italy and the police's merciless suppression of them.\n[1963-07-14T16:57:00] Town Center | \"I heard that they called these young people San Gregorio Armeno, called them Moroccans, called them Fascist, agitators, or anarchist syndicalists. But in reality, those young people didn't belong to any organization at all; they only represented themselves, and when they were angry, they would destroy everything.\"\n[1963-07-14T16:58:00] Town Center | I wanted to find some words to say that would comfort him, so I dared to speak. I heard her say, \"If the problem isn't correctly identified and a solution isn't found quickly, chaos will certainly arise. But the fault isn't with those who resist; it's with the rulers, because they don't know how to govern.\"\n[1963-07-14T16:58:05] Town Center | I saw him looking at me with an appreciative gaze. I heard, \"I'm exactly like you.\"\n[1963-07-14T16:59:00] Town Center | I saw that I was very happy, and I felt encouraged, so I carefully mentioned some of my thoughts about how to reconcile the individual with the world. I thought of the words I had found in Rousseau and in other works that Galiani had made me read.\n[1963-07-14T17:00:00] Town Center | I saw him and asked him. I heard, \"Have you read Federico Cappo?\"\n[1963-07-14T17:00:05] Town Center | I thought of the name because he was the author of that book on the concept of the nation, which I only read a few pages of, and that's all I knew about him, but at school I had learned how to make people believe I knew a lot.\n[1963-07-14T17:00:10] Town Center | I thought, \"Have you read Federico Zabarella?\" That was the only moment during our conversation when Nino showed disapproval.\n[1963-07-14T17:00:15] Town Center | I was suddenly filled with confidence when I realized he didn't know who Zapode was. I began to tell him about what I had read. I thought about it, but I immediately realized that showcasing what he knew and the books he had read was his strength, but also his weakness.\n[1963-07-14T17:00:20] Town Center | I thought that if he managed to get the upper hand, he would feel strong; but if he couldn't get a word in, he would feel very vulnerable.\n[1963-07-14T17:01:00] Town Center | I saw that he was actually frightened, and he immediately changed the subject, steering the conversation elsewhere.\n[1963-07-14T17:05:00] Town Center | I saw him talking to me about the issues of the Italian regions, about the urgency of developing these areas, and about autonomy and \"decentralization.\" He talked about economic plans based on the regions, using many words I had never heard before.\n[1963-07-14T17:05:05] Town Center | I thought, so let's not talk about Zapode. I'll give him the territory. I like listening to him speak.\n[1963-07-14T17:05:10] Town Center | I saw passion on his face; when he was excited, his eyes were very bright.",

    "text": "[1963-07-14T17:40:00] Mergellina | I saw that we walked like this for an hour, talking as we went. I saw strangers bustling around us, speaking in crude local dialects.\n[1963-07-14T17:40:05] Mergellina | I thought about how we felt unique, just the two of us, speaking Italian in a very refined way, talking about topics that interested only us and that others didn't understand.\n[1963-07-14T17:40:10] Mergellina | What were we doing? Were we having a discussion? Preparing for our future? Facing people like us, who had learned to use language?\n[1963-07-14T17:40:15] Mergellina | I thought about our symbolic communication, whether it was to confirm that our long friendship had a foundation and would yield fruitful results, or if it was a refined way of masking desire. I don't know.\n[1963-07-14T17:40:20] Mergellina | I thought I had no interest in those topics, no passion for the real people and events he mentioned. It wasn't because of upbringing or habit, but simply because, as usual, I didn't want to feel embarrassed.\n[1963-07-14T17:40:25] Mergellina | I thought, but those were good times, that's certain. I felt like when you see your report card at the end of the term, and you see the word \"Pass.\"\n[1963-07-14T17:40:30] Mergellina | I thought about it, but I quickly realized it couldn't compare to my early conversations with Lina. Those conversations would ignite my mind. When we talked, we would speak over each other, and there was a feeling of electricity, exciting like a storm.\n[1963-07-14T17:40:35] Mergellina | I thought about being with Nino, and it was completely different. I felt I had to be careful, to say the things he expected me to say. Not only did I have to hide my ignorance, but also avoid mentioning things I knew but he didn't.\n[1963-07-14T17:40:40] Mergellina | I saw myself doing it just like that. I felt proud because he was completely open with me.\n[1963-07-14T17:45:00] Mergellina | I saw it, but then something happened, and he suddenly said, \"Enough.\" Then he took my hand, just like in the movies. I heard, \"I'll take you to a place with a view you'll never forget.\"\n[1963-07-14T17:50:00] Sokolso Square | I saw him pull me onto Serrano Square, his hand never letting go, our fingers entwined.\n[1963-07-14T17:50:05] Sokolso Square | I saw the sea and the arched buildings, and the sky was very blue. I don't remember the exact situation clearly, but I do remember that he kept holding my hand tightly.\n[1963-07-14T17:50:10] Sokolsky Square | I saw that once or twice, he took his hand away to fix his hair, but he quickly grabbed my hand again. I was truly stunned by this.\n[1963-07-14T17:50:15] Sokolso Square | I thought to myself, at one point, how he could reconcile this intimate gesture with his relationship with Miss Galiani's daughter. I thought, maybe for him, it was just a manifestation of friendship between boys and girls.\n[1963-07-14T17:50:20] Sokolsky Square | I was thinking about the [intimate act] he gave me at the bookstore on Via Mezzocannone. Maybe it wasn't anything special, just a new trend, a habit of young people. Anyway, it was indeed a very light [intimate act], a very brief contact.\n[1963-07-14T17:50:25] Sokolso Square | I thought I should be content with the happiness I had, with this vacation I had fought for. Then, he would leave, and I would lose him. He had his own path to take, and no matter what, our paths could never merge.\n[1963-07-14T18:00:00] Sokolsky Square | I saw that I was completely immersed in these troubling thoughts. I saw that at this moment I heard the roar of a motorcycle behind me and the joking voices.\n[1963-07-14T18:00:05] Sokolsky Square | I saw Rino and Stefano riding the \"Lametta\" motorcycle, each carrying their respective wives, speeding past us at full speed.\n[1963-07-14T18:00:10] Sokolsky Square | I saw them slow down and then turn around very flexibly, coming straight toward us. I let go of Nino's hand.\n[1963-07-14T18:01:00] Sokolsky Square | I saw Stefano slow down and asked him. I heard, \"Where's your friend?\"  \n\"He'll be here in a minute.\"  \n\"Give him my regards.\"  \n\"Okay.\"\n[1963-07-14T18:01:05] Sokolsky Square | I heard Rino ask, \"Do you want to take Elena for a drive?\"  \n\"No, thanks.\"  \n\"Come on, she'll be really happy.\"\n[1963-07-14T18:01:10] Sokolsky Square | I saw Nino turn red. I heard, \"I can't ride a motorcycle.\"  \n\"It's very easy, just like riding a bicycle.\"  \n\"I know, but it's not suited for me.\"\n[1963-07-14T18:01:15] Sokolso Square | I saw Stefano smiling. \"I heard, 'Rino! You're a scholar, let it go.'\"\n[1963-07-14T18:02:00] Sokolso Square | I saw Lina pressed against him, wrapping her arms around his waist from behind, urging him forward. I heard, \"Let's go, or we'll miss the boat.\" I saw Stefano more happy than I'd ever seen him before.\n[1963-07-14T18:02:05] Sokolsky Square | I saw Stefano shouting. \"I heard, 'Okay, okay, let's go. Tomorrow we have to work, unlike you who can lie in the sun and swim in the sea. Elena, goodbye, Nino, goodbye! Be good children.'\"\n[1963-07-14T18:02:10] Sokolso Square | I saw Rino speaking very politely. I heard, \"Nice to meet you.\"\n[1963-07-14T18:02:15] Sokolsky Square | I saw them ride off on their motorcycle. Lina raised one arm and waved at Nino, calling out. I heard, \"Please, take her home later.\"\n[1963-07-14T18:02:20] Sokolso Square | I thought about how she acted like my mother, and I felt a bit annoyed, thinking she was pretending to be an adult.\n[1963-07-14T18:02:25] Sokolso Square | I saw Nino grabbing my hand again and said. I heard, \"Rino is cute, but why did Lina marry that idiot?\"\n[1963-07-14T18:10:00] Sokolso Square | I saw that, and I also met Nino's friend Bruno Socavo. I saw he was a slightly short boy, about twenty years old, with a narrow forehead, curly black hair, and an okay face, though there were some dimples on his face, probably from having had a lot of acne before.\n[1963-07-14T18:30:00] Beach | I saw them take me home, and we walked along the wine-red beach in the dusk.\n[1963-07-14T18:40:00] Beach | I saw that along the way, Nino no longer held my hand, even though Bruno kept trying to keep us together: he either walked ahead of us or behind us. I thought it was as if he didn't want to disturb us.\n[1963-07-14T18:45:00] Beach | I noticed that Soca never spoke to me, and I didn't make the effort to strike up a conversation with him either. I found that his shyness made me shy too.\n[1963-07-14T19:00:00] The apartment downstairs | I saw it when we parted, down below the house, it was him instead of Nino who suddenly asked me. I heard, \"Can we meet again tomorrow?\"\n[1963-07-14T19:00:05] Apartment rental downstairs | I saw that Nino had inquired about the place where we swam and sunbathed, and he asked me to be more specific. I told him. I heard, \"Are you going in the morning or the afternoon?\"  \n\"Both morning and afternoon, Lina should swim in the sea as much as possible.\"\n[1963-07-14T19:00:10] Apartment rental downstairs | I saw him say that they would definitely come looking for us.\n[1963-07-14T19:05:00] Rentals | I saw myself climbing the stairs in one go, feeling very happy.\n[1963-07-14T19:05:05] Rentals | I saw it, but as soon as I got home, Pinocchio began to mock me.\n[1963-07-14T19:30:00] Renting House | I saw her say at dinner time. I heard, \"Mom, Elena is dating the son of a poet. The young man has long hair, is very thin and bony, and thinks he's really something.\"\n[1963-07-14T19:30:05] Rentals | I heard, \"It's not like that.\"  \n\"Yes, it is. We saw you holding hands.\"\n[1963-07-14T19:30:10] Renting House | I saw that Nunzia didn't think it was a joke, so I called her seriously and earnestly. I know this is her characteristic.\n[1963-07-14T19:30:15] Renting House | I heard, \"What is Nino's son doing?\"  \n\"He's a university student.\"  \n\"Oh, if you two are in love, then you'll have to wait a bit.\"\n[1963-07-14T19:30:20] Renting House | \"I heard, 'There's nothing to wait for, Mrs. Nunzia, we're just friends.'\"\n\"But let's say, if you were engaged, he should finish his studies first, then find a suitable job. Once he finds work, you can get married.\"\n[1963-07-14T19:30:25] Renting House | I saw that, and Lina made a teasing remark. I heard her say, \"She said you have to wait until your hair turns green.\"",

    "text": "[1963-07-14T19:30:30] Rentals | I said to Nunzia, \"You shouldn't talk to Elena that way.\" To comfort me, she said she married Fernando when she was twenty-one, and Rino was born when she was twenty-three. I heard her say it without any malice, just to state the facts, \"Lina, you married a bit too young.\"\n[1963-07-14T19:30:35] Renting House | I saw Lina hear the words and immediately get angry; she ran to her room and locked herself in.\n[1963-07-14T20:00:00] Renting House | I went to knock on her door when I saw Pinocchia wanted to sleep in the same room as her at night. I heard her shouting at Pinocchia, \"Leave me alone! You have your own room!\"\n[1963-07-14T20:05:00] Renting house | I thought, how could I tell them that Nino and Bruno had promised to come to the beach to find us? I didn't say anything. I thought, if they came, that would be good; if they didn't, why tell them at all.\n[1963-07-14T20:10:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia patiently letting her daughter-in-law sleep in her own room, repeatedly asking her not to take Lina's words to heart when she was angry.\n[1963-07-15 14:00:00] Street | I saw it, but I couldn't be with her all the time. In mid-July, something happened—an event I had actually predicted, but now it had truly taken place. I thought of something that caught me off guard.\n[1963-07-15 14:30:00] Street | I saw, on an afternoon, walking with Lina at Mergellina, talking about what had happened to her, and discussing how to get out of the situation.\n[1963-07-15 16:00:00] Posillipo | I came home later, and it was my sister Elena who opened the door. She was very excited, saying that her teacher—Mr. Oliviero—was in the dining room talking to our mother.\n[1963-07-15 16:01:00] Posillipo | I saw myself timidly entering the dining room. I heard my mother, her face full of resentment, say: \"Teacher Oliviero said you should take a break, you've been studying too hard lately.\"\n[1963-07-15 16:01:10] Posillipo | I saw myself looking at Professor Oliviero. I saw that her face was very pale and somewhat swollen. I couldn't figure out what was going on; it seemed she needed rest more than anything.\n[1963-07-15 16:01:20] Posillipo | I heard her say to me, \"My cousin wrote back yesterday. You can go to Vomero and stay with her for a while, until the end of August. She's happy to have you, but you'll have to help her with some housework.\"\n[1963-07-15 16:01:30] Posillipo | I thought about how she said those things to me as if she were my mother, while my real mother—a woman with a limp and a squint—was a defective product that didn't even need her approval, and I could go to the island.\n[1963-07-15 16:02:00] Posillipo | I saw that after saying those words, she didn't leave immediately. She stayed at my house for another hour, showing me the book she had borrowed.\n[1963-07-15 16:02:10] Posillipo | I saw her pointing out which book I should read first and which next. She told me to put covers on the books before reading them, and to return them to her by the end of summer, in perfect condition, without a single crease.\n[1963-07-15 16:02:20] Posillipo | I saw my mother patiently enduring it, sitting beside us and listening carefully to what we were saying. I saw her squint, which made her look a bit foolish.\n[1963-07-15 17:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that finally, the teacher said goodbye. She didn't even touch my younger sister, and to my mother she only gave a brief, casual greeting.\n[1963-07-15 17:00:10] Posillipo | I saw that in the end, the teacher said she cared a lot about this matter, and if I could go, she would be very happy.\n[1963-07-15 17:01:00] Posillipo | After Professor Oliviero left, my mother finally lost her temper. I thought that she must have suffered those humiliations because of me.\n[1963-07-15 17:01:10] Posillipo | I saw her very angry and said. I heard, \"Our young lady really should go rest on Ischia. She's worked too hard. Go cook something, hurry up! I'll give you a slap if you don't.\"\n[1963-07-15T08:00:00] Barano | When the first week was almost over, I suggested to Lina that we visit the beaches of Barano and Maronti, and Lina enthusiastically accepted.\n[1963-07-15T08:05:00] Barano | I saw Pinocchia didn't want to stay at home alone with Nunzia, and she wanted to come with us too.\n[1963-07-15T09:00:00] Barano\n\nBarano | I saw that we left very early, and we had already put on our swimsuits under our clothes. I saw that I had also brought a bag, containing everyone's towels, sandwiches, and a bottle of water.\n[1963-07-15T09:10:00] Barano | I thought about my suggestion, which was to make a brief visit to Lila, the older sister of Professor Oliviero, who had hosted me during the Vomero period.\n[1963-07-15T09:10:05] Barano | I thought about it, but secretly I was hoping to meet the Nino family and get Nino's address in Mergellina from Pinocchia.\n[1963-07-15T09:10:10] Barano | I thought of course I was worried about meeting Nino's father, Donato, but I hoped he happened to be at work. On the other hand, in order to see his son, I had already prepared myself to face his lewd remarks.\n[1963-07-15T09:30:00] Beach | I saw what I wanted to protest. I thought at that moment she was almost about to say that she was giving me money. She didn't say it, but the meaning was clear enough. It was like someone raising their hand as if to slap you, but then not doing it.\n[1963-07-15T10:00:00] Elena's house | When I suddenly appeared in front of her like a ghost as Leni opened the door, she gasped in surprise. I saw her eyes, filled with tears.\n[1963-07-15T10:00:05] Elena's house | I saw that, and not only that, she reminded me of her cousin. She told me that Teacher Oliviero was not doing well in Potenza, so his body had never fully recovered. \"I heard 'These are tears of joy,' she explained.\"\n[1963-07-15T10:10:00] Elena's house | I saw her lead us to the balcony, where she brought out various things to serve us, especially taking special care of Pinocchia and the child in her belly.\n[1963-07-15T10:15:00] Elena's house | I saw her make Pinocchia sit down, as if wanting to touch her belly.\n[1963-07-15T10:20:00] Elena's house | I saw myself showing Lina around there, like a pilgrim revealing a corner of the balcony to her. I know I spent a long time in the sun, and the place where I sat at the table, and the place where I slept in the kitchen at night.\n[1963-07-15T10:20:05] Elena's house | I suddenly thought of Donato bending down, putting his hand under my sheets and touching me.\n[1963-07-15T10:20:10] Elena's house | I saw it, but that didn't stop me from naturally asking Elena. I thought I felt sick.\n[1963-07-15T10:20:15] Elena's house | I heard, \"Where's Nino's family?\"\n\"They're on the beach.\"\n\"How's this year?\"\n\"Hard to say.\"\n[1963-07-15T10:20:20] Elena's house | \"I heard 'They're asking too much?'\"\n\"When he wasn't working as a train attendant but as a journalist, he was more demanding.\"\n[1963-07-15T10:20:25] Elena's house | I heard, \"Is he here?\"  \n\"Yes, he's taken a sick leave.\"  \n\"Is Pinocchia here?\"  \n\"Pinocchia isn't here. Everyone else is.\"\n[1963-07-15T10:20:30] Elena's house | I saw her laugh heartily. I heard, \"Everyone?\"  \n\"You've already understood.\"  \n\"No, I really don't understand at all.\"\n[1963-07-15T10:20:35] Elena's house | I heard, \"Nino is here today, Elena! He only shows up when he needs money, then disappears for a while and goes to a friend's house at Mergellina.\"\n[1963-07-15T10:25:00] Beach | I saw it, but as she spoke these words, she kept trying constantly and was making rapid progress.\n[1963-07-15T10:30:00] Beach | I knew she could memorize every movement quickly because she had that ability—she learned to mend shoes quickly, cut sausages and cheese skillfully, and manipulate the scale. I thought that she was born this way, and I felt that if she just saw the goldsmith using his chisel, she would be able to learn how to make gold jewelry, and later her craftsmanship would be even better than her master's.\n[1963-07-15T10:35:00] Beach | I saw the truth: she was no longer struggling in the water, she controlled every movement perfectly. I saw her as if she had drawn her body on the sea: her legs and arms moved slowly through the water, long and slender, unlike Nino's, who splashed noisily, and not like Nino's father, whose movements were rough.",

Lina had already begun to mock our clumsiness.\n[1963-07-15T10:50:00] Traveling | I saw that all along the way, Lina was teasing me in a light-hearted manner. \"I heard her say, 'You're too cunning,' 'You brought me to Vomero because Nino is here. Just admit it.'\"\n[1963-07-15T10:50:05] Traveling | I saw it, but I refused to acknowledge it, to talk about it.\n[1963-07-15T11:00:00] Traveling | At that moment, Pinocchia and her sister-in-law joined forces, speaking in a more serious tone, saying that she had traveled all the way to Barano at great effort and expense, all because of my personal reasons, and we hadn't considered her [reproductive condition] at all.\n[1963-07-15T11:00:05] Traveling | I knew from this moment on that I was even more certain in denying it. I even threatened them, saying that if they said anything like that in front of the Nino family, I would take the boat that night back to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1963-07-15T11:30:00] Malongti Beach | I saw them, a family, on the beach as soon as I arrived. I saw them again, just as they were a few years ago, still in the same place, their sun umbrellas the same, the same swimsuits and handbags, even the way they lay on the beach in the sun was the same.\n[1963-07-15T11:30:05] Malonto Beach | I saw Donato lying in the black sand, his stomach exposed, propping himself up with his elbows. His wife Lidia was sitting on a towel, reading a weekly magazine.\n[1963-07-15T11:30:10] Malonto Beach | The thing that disappointed me most was that I couldn't see Nino under the umbrella.\n[1963-07-15T11:30:15] Malonti Beach | I saw myself searching for him in the water right away. I saw, I saw a black dot in the water, appearing and disappearing on the undulating sea, and I hoped that black spot was him.\n[1963-07-15T11:35:00] Malonto Beach | I shouted the names of Pino, Clelia, and Ciro, who were playing on the beach, announcing my arrival.\n[1963-07-15T11:35:05] Malonti Beach | I saw that Silo had grown up, but he didn't recognize me, just smiling a bit bewilderedly.\n[1963-07-15T11:35:10] Malongti Beach | I saw Pinocchio and Clarissa running toward me very enthusiastically, and their parents looked at me with curiosity. Lydia immediately stood up, shouting my name and waving to greet me.\n[1963-07-15T11:36:00] Malonto Beach | I saw Nino running toward me, arms open, a welcoming smile on his face, and I dodged his embrace. I heard myself saying only, \"Hello, is everything okay?\"\n[1963-07-15T11:40:00] Malongti Beach | I saw that they were all very polite to me. I introduced Lina and Pinocchia, and mentioned who their parents and husbands were.\n[1963-07-15T11:45:00] Malonto Beach | I saw Donato immediately direct his attention to them, politely addressing them as Mrs. Caracci, Mrs. Lina. He brought up things from their childhood, then spoke at length, as usual, about how quickly time had passed.\n[1963-07-15T11:50:00] Malongti Beach | I saw myself talking with Lydia, and I asked concerned questions about the children, especially about Pinocchio. I thought it was obvious that Pino, Clelia, and Ciro were doing very well now.\n[1963-07-15T11:55:00] Malonto Beach | I saw them closing in, ready to pull me into their game.\n[1963-07-15T12:00:00] Malongti Beach | I asked about Pinocchio, and Lydia said she stayed at San Gregorio Armeno, living with her uncle. I know she has to retake four courses in September, so she needs to have tutoring now.\n[1963-07-15T12:00:05] Malongti Beach | I heard \"She really got what was coming to her!\" Lydia suddenly said. \"She didn't study properly all semester, now she's finally getting her just deserts.\"\n[1963-07-15T12:00:10] Malonto Beach | I didn't say anything, but I had already ruled out the possibility that Pinocchia was suffering: she might spend the whole summer in the store on Piazza Martiri with Alfonso Carracci, and I was happy for her.\n[1963-07-15T12:05:00] Malongti Beach | Throughout our conversation, she kept casting fearful glances at her husband; Donato was now being funny and likable in front of Lina and Pinocchia. I saw the traces of pain on Lydia's broad face, in her eyes, on her sunken breasts, and on her heavy belly.\n[1963-07-15T12:10:00] Malonto Beach | I saw that Lydia was no longer paying attention to me; she kept staring at Donato. I knew because he had to accompany the two of them to swim, and he had promised Lina that he would teach her how to swim.\n[1963-07-15T12:10:05] Malongti Beach | I heard him say, \"I taught each of my children to swim, and I'll teach you too.\"\n[1963-07-15T12:20:00] Malongti Beach | I had never inquired about Nino, and Lydia had never mentioned him either.\n[1963-07-15T12:30:00] Malongti Beach | I saw the black dot, which had been bobbing up and down in the shimmering blue sea, stop moving further out and instead change direction, swimming toward the shore. I saw the black spot growing larger, and his face began to emerge from the white splashes.\n[1963-07-15T12:30:05] Malongti Beach | After I saw Nino come out of the water, he looked at his father with curiosity as the man lifted Lina up with one hand and showed her how to swim with the other. I thought, \"Yes, it's him.\" I thought very nervously.\n[1963-07-15T12:30:10] Maronti Beach | I saw that when he saw me, his face was actually filled with anger. I heard him ask, \"What are you doing here?\"\n[1963-07-15T12:30:15] Malongdi Beach | I heard \"I'm on vacation here.\" I replied, \"I came by to say hello to Mrs. Nella.\"\n[1963-07-15T12:30:20] Malonto Beach | I saw him glance at his father and the two girls with an irritated look. I heard him ask, \"Isn't that Lina?\"\n[1963-07-15T12:30:25] Malongti Beach | I saw him carefully dry his hair and then start staring at the three people in the water. \"I heard, 'Yes, the other one is her sister-in-law Pinocchia, I don't know if you remember her.'\"\n[1963-07-15T12:30:30] Malonto Beach | I couldn't wait to tell him that we would be staying at Vomero until the end of August, that our place wasn't far from Mergellina, and that Lina's mother had also come. Lina and Pinocchia's husband would come to the island on Sunday.\n[1963-07-15T12:30:35] Malongdi Beach | I saw that he wasn't really listening while I was speaking, but I still told him everything, right in front of Lydia, that I had nothing to do this weekend.\n[1963-07-15T12:30:40] Malongti Beach | \"I'll stay in touch,\" he said, then to his mother, \"I have to go.\"\n[1963-07-15T12:30:45] Malongti Beach | I heard, \"So soon already leaving?\"  \n\"I have something to do.\"  \n\"Elena is here.\"\n[1963-07-15T12:30:50] Malongti Beach | I saw Nino look at me, as if he had just realized I was there.\n[1963-07-15T12:30:55] Malongti Beach | I saw him fumble in the pocket of his shirt hanging under the umbrella, pulled out a pencil and a notebook, wrote something on it, then tore off the page and handed it to me.\n[1963-07-15T12:31:00] Malongti Beach | I heard him say, \"I live here.\" I saw him as stylish and neat as a movie actor.\n[1963-07-15T12:31:05] Malonto Beach | I saw myself taking the note, as if it were a sacred object.\n[1963-07-15T12:31:10] Malonto Beach | I saw him not answering. \"I'll eat something before I go,\" his mother pleaded with him.  \n\"At least say hello to your father.\"\n[1963-07-15T12:31:15] Malongti Beach | I saw him wrap the towel around his waist, change into his swim trunks, and then leave the beach without saying goodbye to anyone.",

    "text": "[1963-07-15T14:00:00] Beach | I saw her bullying attitude disappear suddenly when Nino and Bruno showed up in the afternoon. I saw Nino was very tall, and Bruno only reached his shoulder. When they appeared on the beach, a cool breeze blew, making me not want to go into the water.\n[1963-07-15T14:05:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio was the first to see them; they were walking along the beach, among the children playing with shovels and pails. I heard her suddenly laugh and say, \"Your girlfriend's here.\"\n[1963-07-15T14:05:05] Beach | I saw Nino and his friend walking over with towels slung over their shoulders, cigarettes and a lighter in their hands, moving with calm confidence. I saw their eyes searching through the crowd of swimmers for us.\n[1963-07-15T14:06:00] Beach | I saw myself suddenly feel encouraged, and I called out their names, spreading my arms wide to show them that we were here. I thought of Nino keeping his promise, and he must have already felt the desire to see me, so he pulled along his silent classmate specifically to come find me at Mergellina.\n[1963-07-15T14:06:05] Beach | I thought there was nothing for him to talk about with Lina and Pinochia, and I was the only one among them who wasn't married and didn't have a boyfriend. So it was obvious that he had come all this way just to see me.\n[1963-07-15T14:07:00] Beach | I saw Nino spread his towel next to me and sit down. Then he pointed to the sky-blue cloth—since I was the only one sitting on the sand, I immediately sat down next to him. I thought I was happy, and beyond that, my thoughts were confirmed. I became very passionate, full of laughter and conversation.\n[1963-07-15T14:10:00] Beach | At that moment, Lina and Pinocchia became silent. They no longer mocked me with sarcastic remarks, nor did they quarrel with each other. They were listening to Nino telling funny stories about his life with his classmates.\n[1963-07-15T14:20:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio take a long time before he started speaking, using a dialect-inflected Italian. I heard her say that the sea was clear and warm today, and that the man who sells fresh coconuts hadn't passed by yet; she really wanted a coconut.\n[1963-07-15T14:20:05] Beach | I saw that Nino hadn't paid any attention to what she said; he was completely engrossed in his own witty storytelling. As I thought about this, Bruno noticed it, and he felt it was his duty to fulfill the wish of a pregnant woman: she was worried that her child would be born with a coconut-shaped birthmark.\n[1963-07-15T14:21:00] Beach | I volunteered to go and look for him.\n[1963-07-15T14:22:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchia immediately start talking to Bruno. They spoke in low voices, as if afraid of disturbing someone. I thought of Pinocchio, who loved the way he spoke—with a shy but passionate voice, the voice of someone who didn't want to hurt anyone.\n[1963-07-15T14:30:00] Beach | I saw that Lina still hadn't said a word. She wasn't paying attention to Pinocchia and Bruno's polite greetings, but was instead listening all along to my conversation with Nino.\n[1963-07-15T14:35:00] Beach | I saw that twice I suddenly said I wanted to take a walk, all the way to the crater, and I hoped Nino would say to me: Let's go. I felt very uncomfortable thinking about that kind of attention.\n[1963-07-15T14:35:05] Beach | I saw him, but he had just mentioned the chaotic architecture of Vomero. He simply nodded mechanically and continued speaking.\n[1963-07-15T14:40:00] Beach | I saw him pull Bruno into the conversation, and Nino asked Bruno to prove it, since there were many unattractive buildings next to his parents' house. I thought that maybe Bruno and Pinocchio's conversation had disturbed him.\n[1963-07-15T14:40:05] Beach | I thought about how urgently he needed to express himself, to repeat what he had read, to articulate what he had observed—that was his way of organizing his thoughts: talking, talking, talking. But I also thought that this was perhaps a manifestation of his loneliness.\n[1963-07-15T14:40:10] Beach | I thought about how I felt that I was a lot like him, which made me feel proud. Just like him, I wanted to shape myself into a man of learning and have others acknowledge that, as if saying: This is what I know, this is who I want to be.\n[1963-07-15T14:40:15] Beach | I saw that several times I wanted to interject, but Nino didn't give me the chance, and the result was that I just listened to him, like everyone else.\n[1963-07-15T14:45:00] Beach | I saw until Pinocchio and Bruno said. I heard, \"Well, we're going for a walk right now, let's go find someone selling coconuts.\"\n[1963-07-15T14:45:05] Beach | I saw myself looking at Lina with expectation. I thought I wished she would go with her sister-in-law, letting me be alone with Nino, sitting on the same towel.\n[1963-07-15T14:45:10] Beach | I saw her, but she said nothing. Pinocchio found herself forced to go for a walk alone with a young, polite man—still a stranger, and she impatiently asked me. I heard, \"Elena, come on, you don't want to take a walk?\"  \nI replied, \"Yes, but I want to finish this conversation first, then find you.\"\n[1963-07-15T14:45:15] Beach | I saw she was very upset, and she walked toward the steaming place with Bruno: they were the same height.\n[1963-07-15T15:00:00] Beach | I saw us talking about San Gregorio Armeno and Vomero, as well as the entire Campania region. I heard Nino describing them with a string of words: \"robbers, destroyers, bloodsuckers, and those people who make money by the crateful but don't pay taxes—contractors, their lawyers, Camorra gangsters, the dictator of Fascist, members of the Christian Democratic Party. They are all solid as a rock, high and mighty, like God himself, holding a huge shovel, digging here on the mountain, there on the coast.\" I thought that all these places had fallen into the hands of the worst people, but those people themselves believed they were the best.\n[1963-07-15T15:05:00] Beach | I saw the information I sometimes mention about in the Southern News. I thought that when we said it was a discussion among the three of us, it was somewhat inaccurate—actually, it was just him talking.\n[1963-07-15T15:10:00] Beach | I saw that as for Lina, she only spoke up once, when Nino mentioned the list of bandits in the city, and he also mentioned \"merchants.\" I heard her ask, \"Who is the merchant?\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:05] Beach | I saw Nino, mid-sentence, suddenly stop and look at her in surprise. I heard \"They're just merchants.\"  \n\"Why do you call them peddlers?\"  \n\"Everyone says that way.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:10] Beach | I heard, \"My husband is a merchant.\"  \n\"I don't mean to offend you.\"  \n\"I'm not angry.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:15] Beach | I heard, \"Are you paying taxes?\"  \n\"That's the first time I've ever heard of paying taxes.\"  \n\"Really?\"  \n\"Really.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:20] Beach | I heard the words, \"Taxation is very important for the economic life of a society.\"\n\n\"That's what they say. Do you remember Pasquale Peluso?\" \n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:25] Beach | I heard, \"He's a mason; if he didn't build these concrete buildings, he'd be out of work.\"  \n\"Mmm.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:30] Beach | I heard, \"But he's a party member, his father was also a party member. According to the court's statement, it was his father who killed my grandfather, and my grandfather made money through usury and selling goods on the black market.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:35] Beach | I heard, \"Pasquale was just like his father, never willing to settle things peacefully, and the other party comrades thought the same. Even though all my husband's money came from my father-in-law, I and Pasquale were still good friends.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:10:40] Beach | I saw Lina make a self-mocking face. \"I heard 'I don't know, what are you trying to say?'\"  \n\"I don't know either. I just want to listen to you, to find out what you have to say.\"\n[1963-07-15T15:11:00] Beach | I said those words when I thought of her, and that was all I said. But when she spoke, she didn't have her usual domineering tone. It seemed as if she really wanted us to help her understand these issues: Mask_loc_002's life was a complete mess.\n[1963-07-15T15:11:05] Beach | I saw that she was almost always speaking in dialect. I thought of it as if trying to show humility and modesty: I don't pretend, I speak with my own words.\n[1963-07-15T15:11:10] Beach | I saw her honestly listing out those scattered facts, not connecting them with a central thread as she usually did.\n[1963-07-15T15:12:00] Beach | I know that neither I nor she paid any attention to taxes: our parents, friends, boyfriends, husbands, and relatives had no idea that taxes even existed. In school, the teachers never mentioned anything like that, nor did they talk about anything related to politics. I thought, really, neither she nor I had ever heard the word \"merchant,\" which was full of contempt in both cultural and political terms.\n[1963-07-15T15:12:05] Beach | I thought that even so, Lina could still disrupt the conversation that afternoon, and up until then, these had all been serious new topics.\n[1963-07-15T15:15:00] Beach | After saying those few sentences, Nino immediately tried to go back to the topic he had been discussing, but he became incoherent and ended up talking again about some amusing stories from his life with Bruno.\n[1963-07-15T15:20:00] Beach | I saw him say that Bruno only ate sausages and fried eggs, and he drank a lot of wine. I thought of it, and then he acted out these funny incidents, which made him a bit embarrassed.\n[1963-07-15T15:30:00] Beach | I saw him relax when he saw Pinocchia and Bruno returning with coconuts, their hair soaked, as if they had just swum.\n[1963-07-15T15:30:05] Beach | I saw Pinocchio and sighed. I heard, \"I walked around, and it really made me happy.\" I thought, but her expression seemed to say, \"You two rotten people, you made me go out alone with a stranger.\"\n[1963-07-15T16:00:00] Beach | When I saw the two young men saying goodbye, I walked with them for a while. I was just trying to state a fact: they are my friends, they came to see me.\n[1963-07-15T16:05:00] Beach | I saw Nino say somewhat gloomily. I heard, \"Lina really got held back, such a pity.\"\n[1963-07-15T16:10:00] Beach | I saw myself nodding in agreement, and after saying goodbye to them, I put my feet in the water, trying to calm myself down.\n[1963-07-15T17:00:00] Renting house | I thought about how when we got home, both I and Pinocchia were happy, but Lina was troubled.\n[1963-07-15T17:30:00] Renting House | I saw Pinocchia telling Nunzia about the two young men who had come to the beach to visit us.",

    "text": "[1963-07-15T17:35:00] Renting Room | What I didn't expect was that Pinocchia was very satisfied with Bruno. To avoid her child being born with a coconut-shaped birthmark, he took great trouble to accompany her in search of a coconut seller.\n[1963-07-15T17:40:00] Rentals | I saw her say that he was a well-mannered young man, although he was a student, he wasn't boring at all. He didn't seem to care much about his appearance, but every piece of clothing he wore, from his swimsuit to his shirt, even his slippers, were all expensive. I found it strange that Bruno was very rich, as were her brother, Rino, and Solara, but his behavior was completely different.\n[1963-07-15T17:40:05] Renting House | I heard her say something that surprised me greatly. I thought about the beach bar where he bought me this and that, but there was no hint of showing off.\n[1963-07-15T17:50:00] Renting Room | I saw Pinocchio's mother-in-law, Nunzia, didn't go to the beach at all during the entire holiday. She was busy shopping, cleaning the house, preparing dinner, and packing our lunch for the next day at the beach.\n[1963-07-15T17:55:00] Renting House | I saw her listening to them as if they were magical world things. I thought she noticed her daughter tilting her head and giving Pinocchio a scrutinizing look.\n[1963-07-15T18:00:00] Malongti Beach | I saw that we spent the whole day at Maronti Beach, playing with some children and swimming together.\n[1963-07-15T18:30:00] Malongti Beach | I saw Pinocchio and Lina completely absorbed in their conversation with Donato, and in the end, he even took both of them for a walk all the way to the hot springs.\n[1963-07-15T19:00:00] Malongti Beach | I saw Pinocchio was completely exhausted, too tired to go home, and Nino told us a very comfortable way to get back.\n[1963-07-15T19:30:00] On the boat | I saw us arrive at a hotel, which was basically built over water, like stilts. We rented a boat for just a few lira, and there was an old sailor on the boat.\n[1963-07-15T19:35:00] On the boat | I saw that we had just boarded the boat when Lina spoke in a sarcastic tone. I heard, \"Nino didn't even pay attention to you.\"\n[1963-07-15T19:35:05] On the boat | I heard, \"He's studying.\"  \n\"Doesn't he even have time to say 'hello'?\"  \n\"That's just how he is.\"\n[1963-07-15T19:35:10] On the boat | I saw Pinocchio interject a sentence. I heard, \"It's really bad. The father was so polite, the son is so rude.\"\n[1963-07-15T19:35:15] On the boat | I thought they both believed that Nino wasn't interested in me or friendly toward me. I thought it was better for them to think that way. I carefully kept my secret.\n[1963-07-15T19:35:20] On the boat | I thought that in the end, they all agreed that a girl as outstanding as me wouldn't even be glanced at by Nino, and it was acceptable that they were completely ignored; they would forgive him.\n[1963-07-15T19:35:25] On the boat | I saw Pinocchia appreciating Nino's gentlemanly behavior. I thought about how I wanted to protect him, to keep him from their harassment, and I succeeded—apparently they soon forgot about him.\n[1963-07-15T19:35:30] On the boat | I saw Lina say contentedly. \"I heard, 'He taught me how to float on water, taught me how to swim, he's great.'\"\n[1963-07-15T20:00:00] On the boat | I watched the sun slowly set, and the purple sky made me feel cold inside. I thought about Donato's harassment toward me, and I felt uncomfortable all over.\n[1963-07-15T20:00:05] On the boat | I said to Lina. I heard, \"That's what he wrote, that the painting boards in the shops on Martiri Square were ugly.\"\n[1963-07-15T20:00:10] On the boat | I saw Pinocchio at that moment wearing a satisfied expression. I heard Lina say, \"He's right.\"\n[1963-07-15T20:00:15] On the boat | I heard, \"It was him who ruined Melina.\" I thought of this and it made me very angry.\n[1963-07-15T20:00:20] On the boat | I saw Lina smile and reply. I heard, \"Maybe, but he did make her happy once.\"\n[1963-07-15T20:00:25] On the boat | I thought of those words, and it hurt me deeply. I knew what Melina had suffered, the torment her child had endured, and I also knew Lydia's pain.\n[1963-07-15T20:00:30] On the boat | I thought of men like Nino, whose refined exterior concealed a desire no one could stop.\n[1963-07-15T20:00:35] On the boat | I thought of how Lina had witnessed the suffering of the widow Melina since childhood, and I would never forget Lina's expression of pain at that time.\n[1963-07-15T20:00:40] On the boat | I wondered what was really behind her tone now? What did those words mean? Was it a signal she was giving me? Did she want to tell me: You're just a girl, you don't have any idea what a woman needs?\n[1963-07-15T20:00:45] On the boat | I thought to myself that I was about to change my mind, no longer hiding my secret, and I wanted to immediately show that I was just like them, a woman. I knew what women needed.\n[1963-07-15T20:00:50] On the boat | I said to Lina. I heard, \"Nino gave me his address. If you don't mind, when Stefano and Rino come, I'll go see him.\"\n[1963-07-15T20:00:55] On the boat | I saw Lina squinting, a line forming on her broad forehead. I thought about the address? To go find him? These were all very bold words.\n[1963-07-15T20:01:00] On the boat | I saw Pinocchio looking at me with ill intent. She touched Lina's knee and smiled. I heard, \"Did you hear? Elena has a date tomorrow, and she has the address.\"\n[1963-07-15T20:01:05] On the boat | I heard, \"Well, if you're with your husbands, what can I do?\" I saw and felt my face turn red.\n[1963-07-15T20:10:00] On the boat | I watched for a long time; we both stared at the helmsman in silence. I could only hear the sound of the boat's motor.\n[1963-07-15T20:10:05] On the boat | I saw Lina say coldly. I heard, \"You can keep my mother company, I brought you here, it's not like you're here to play.\"\n[1963-07-15T20:10:10] On the boat | I saw that I was forcing myself not to explode. I thought about the week of freedom we had. That day, whether it was her or Pinocchia, whether on the beach, under the sun, or when swimming, Donato's flattering words made them laugh so much that they forgot who they were.\n[1963-07-15T20:10:15] On the boat | I thought about how Donato made them feel like children, handed over to a father, an unusual and very rare father, one who wouldn't punish you but instead encouraged you to express your desires without any sense of guilt.\n[1963-07-15T20:10:20] On the boat | I thought to myself, this day is over! I announced that I would have a day entirely for myself, spending it with a university student. It was, of course, a reminder to the two of them that their week of freedom from being wives was over, and their husbands were about to return.\n[1963-07-15T20:10:25] On the boat | I thought, is this what I've done? Yes, I've gone too far. I thought, shut up! Don't anger them.\n[1963-07-15T21:00:00] Rentals | I saw that Lina was just a bit absent-minded. She didn't cause any trouble; she let Pinocchia sleep in her bed and said goodnight to everyone.\n[1963-07-15T21:10:00] Renting House | I saw that, to my surprise, she came into my small room immediately after we had [intimate act].\n[1963-07-15T21:10:05] Rentals | I heard her ask, \"Can you let me see one of your books?\"\n[1963-07-15T21:10:10] Renting House | I saw myself looking at her uneasily. I thought about her wanting to read again? How long had it been since she'd read a book? Three years? Four? Why had she decided to start again now?\n[1963-07-15T21:15:00] Renting House | I saw the book by Beckett that I had taken, the one I used to swat mosquitoes, and I gave it to her. I thought that it was the easiest book for me to read at the time.\n[1963-07-16T09:00:00] Renting House | I know that the entire week was spent in long periods of waiting and brief moments of togetherness.\n[1963-07-16T09:00:05] Renting House | I knew those two guys had their own schedules, which they strictly followed: they got up at six in the morning, studied until lunchtime, walked to the place where we met at three in the afternoon, left at seven in the evening, and then continued studying after dinner.\n[1963-07-16T09:00:10] Beach | I saw that Nino never appeared alone; he was always with Bruno. I know that despite their very different personalities, they get along very well, especially when facing us; it seems they draw strength from each other.\n[1963-07-16T15:00:00] Beach | I thought of Pinocchio, but I soon doubted their harmony; she believed they weren't really good friends, and their relationship wasn't as solid as it seemed.\n[1963-07-16T15:05:00] Beach | I heard her say, \"Yes, all talk and no substance.\" She repeated it again. I thought that she believed their relationship was built on Bruno's patience, because he had a good nature and could accept Nino, without any complaints. Nino's endless nonsense all day long was simply unbearable.\n[1963-07-16T15:10:00] Beach | I saw it, but then she apologized to me, saying she shouldn't have used a sarcastic tone when talking about the topics I loved so much. \"I heard her say, 'You're all students, you can certainly understand each other, but at least let me express my feelings.'\"\n[1963-07-16T15:15:00] Beach | I thought about her words, which gave me a sense of pleasure. With Lina there, it seemed like an acknowledgment from her, a silent witness who proved that there was an exclusive relationship between me and Nino, one that others found hard to get involved in.\n[1963-07-17 10:00:00] Posillipo | Two days later, my mother measured me and sewed a swimsuit for me, somewhat angrily. I thought about how I didn't know where she had gotten the pattern from.\n[1963-07-17T15:00:00] Beach | I saw one day that Pinocchio spoke to Bruno and Lina in a scornful tone. I heard, \"Let them talk about their studies, we'll go swimming, the water is great today!\"\n[1963-07-17T15:00:05] Beach | I didn't show any particular resistance to this statement. I thought about discussing academics? Obviously, she meant that the things we were talking about weren't out of real interest—we were just pretending.\n[1963-07-17T15:00:10] Beach | I saw that this remark had stirred up Nino, and he stopped halfway through his sentence.\n[1963-07-17T15:00:15] Beach | I saw him suddenly stand up and dash into the sea, not caring at all about the water temperature, splashing water all over us.\n[1963-07-17T15:00:20] Beach | I saw us begging him to stop, while we shakily stepped into the water. He went to join Bruno in a water fight, pretending to drown him.\n[1963-07-17T15:05:00] Beach | I thought to myself that he was just like that—full of great ideas, and could be very interesting, very pleasant if he wanted to.\n[1963-07-17T15:05:05] Beach | I wondered why he always looked so serious in front of me. Did Teacher Galiani make him think that I was only interested in studying? Or was it because of my glasses, the way I spoke, that gave him that impression?\n[1963-07-17T15:10:00] Beach | I thought back to that moment, and I felt regretful about the way we spent afternoons from then on, because we were always talking nervously, he eager to express his thoughts, and me anxious to say something meaningful, to get his approval. There was no more moment when he held my hand, and he never invited me to sit on his towel again.\n[1963-07-17T15:10:05] Beach | I saw Bruno and Pinochia laughing about something very simple. I thought about how jealous I was of them. I so wanted to be with Nino, laughing like they did. I didn't want anything else, just to be closer to him, just like Pinocchio and Bruno, that's all I asked for. I wasn't asking for much.\n[1963-07-18T10:00:00] Beach | I saw Lina as if she was lost in her own thoughts. Most of the morning she spent in the sea, always swimming back and forth just a few meters from the shore, along a line parallel to the coast. I saw that she remained calm all week.\n[1963-07-18T10:30:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio swimming with me, and we continued to teach her, although she now swam better than all of us.\n[1963-07-18T11:00:00] Beach | I saw that we would soon feel very cold, so we ran onto the hot sand and lay down, but she kept practicing in the water, calmly stretching her arms, moving her legs lightly, with a beautiful rhythm, just like Nino had taught her.\n[1963-07-18T11:10:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio, in the sunlight, rubbing her stomach and muttering to herself. I heard that Lina always exaggerates about everything.\n[1963-07-18T11:20:00] Beach | I often straightened up and shouted at Lina on the beach. I heard, \"Stop swimming, you've been in the water for too long, you'll catch a cold.\"\n[1963-07-18T11:30:00] Beach | I saw but Lina didn't listen to me at all; she had just come out of the water. I saw her body turn blue, her eyes white, her lips purple, and her hands and feet wrinkled.\n[1963-07-18T11:35:00] Beach | I saw myself holding her towel, waiting on the shore. I placed the towel on her back and rubbed hard to dry her. I saw her towel had been heated by the sun.\n[1963-07-18T15:00:00] Beach | I saw the two guys come every day—without missing a single day. They either swam with us, but Lina usually refused to get in the water. She'd sit on a towel on the shore and watch us from there.\n[1963-07-18T16:00:00] Beach | I saw that either everyone went for a walk together, and she would always stay behind collecting shells, or if I talked about world affairs with Nino, she would listen very attentively but rarely speak.\n[1963-07-18T16:30:00] Beach | I know that through this back-and-forth, some small habits formed, and everyone followed these routines. I was a bit surprised by this thought.\n[1963-07-18T16:35:00] Beach | I know, for example, that when Bruno came, he always brought some cold drinks, which he bought at a water bar in a public bathhouse along the way.\n[1963-07-19T15:00:00] Beach | One day, I saw Pinocchio notice Bruno had bought me a soda, but I usually drank orange juice, so Pinocchio made him exchange it. I heard myself say, \"Thank you, Bruno, this will do.\"\n[1963-07-19T16:00:00] Beach | I saw, for example, that Pinocchia and Bruno would go looking for fresh coconuts at some point in the afternoon, although they always made us go with them, Lina never thought of joining them, and neither did I or Nino.\n[1963-07-19T17:00:00] Beach | I sometimes saw them bring white-fleshed coconuts, and sometimes they would forget to buy them. I saw them leave still dry, but when they came back, their bodies were soaked by the sea.\n[1963-07-19T17:05:00] Beach | I saw that at this point Lina would ask them. I heard, \"Where's today's coconut?\"",

We walked toward the harbor, and she bought me a ticket.\n[1963-07-20 08:10:00] Port | I saw her giving me a lot of instructions during the time we waited to board the boat.\n[1963-07-20 08:10:10] Port | I thought the part she was most worried about was the crossing of the sea.\n[1963-07-20 08:10:20] Port | I heard her say, \"I wish the waves weren't so big.\" She was almost talking to herself.\n[1963-07-20 08:10:30] Port | I heard her say with absolute certainty that when I was a child, maybe three or four years old, she took me every day to the Crociale Beach, where the sea was beautiful, and my conjunctivitis healed. There I learned to swim.\n[1963-07-20 08:10:40] Port | I said I didn't remember anything about Ciro's Beach, or the sea, or the fact that I could swim.\n[1963-07-20 08:10:50] Port | I saw her speaking with resentment, saying, \"I really can swim.\"\n[1963-07-20 08:11:00] Port | I thought, it's as if I drowned in water, and that shouldn't be her fault. She had done what she was supposed to do. If I drowned, it could only be because I was too forgetful.\n[1963-07-20 08:11:10] Port | I saw her telling me not to go too far from the shore, even when the sea was calm, and I had to stay home if the waves were big or if there were red flags on the beach.\n[1963-07-20 08:11:20] Port | I heard her say, \"Especially,\" to me, \"after eating a meal, or when your period comes, you can't even put your feet in the water.\"\n[1963-07-20 08:15:00] Port | I saw her before leaving, and she asked an old sailor to look after me.\n[1963-07-20 08:30:00] Ship | I saw the boat leave the dock. I thought to myself that I felt both surprised and happy.\n[1963-07-20 08:30:10] Ship | I saw my first journey away from home, traveling by sea.\n[1963-07-20 08:30:20] Ship | I saw my mother's plump body, the place where we lived, Mergellina, and Lina's affairs drifting further and further away, until they finally disappeared.\n[1963-07-20 09:00:00] Ship | I thought I had experienced a rebirth.\n[1963-07-20 10:00:00] Barano | I saw myself arriving in the village by car and easily finding her house. I know that my teacher's aunt is named Elena Incardo, and she lives in Barano.\n[1963-07-20 10:10:00] Barano | I thought to myself that I had discovered she was a very warm-hearted woman, quite plump, and very outgoing, always eager to chat.\n[1963-07-20 10:10:10] Barano | I know she never married. She rented out the room to people coming for vacations, keeping a small room and the kitchen for herself.\n[1963-07-20 10:20:00] Barano | I realized I would have to sleep in the kitchen, setting up a bed at night and taking it down again in the morning (the table, the shelf, and the mattress).\n[1963-07-20 10:30:00] Barano | I realized I had some unavoidable tasks: I needed to get up at 6:30 in the morning and prepare breakfast for her and the guests. I knew that when I arrived, they were staying with a British couple and their two children.\n[1963-07-20 10:30:10] Barano | I saw that I still had to clear the plates and cups, set the table for dinner, and wash the dishes before going to bed.\n[1963-07-20 10:30:20] Barano | I saw that in other times, I was always free, could lie on the rooftop facing the sea and read. I saw or walked down a very steep slope, arriving at a long, wide, dark beach—the locals call it Maronti Beach.\n[1963-07-20T15:00:00] Beach | I noticed that Lina was also paying attention to my conversation with Nino. When he talked too much, she would lose patience and say something to Nino. I heard, \"Didn't you come across anything interesting today?\"\n[1963-07-20T15:05:00] Beach | I know that Elena would be happy to see Nino, and he would start talking at length, meaning he would talk about the issues that concerned him most.\n[1963-07-20T15:10:00] Beach | I watched him talk, talk, talk. I almost always agreed with his point of view. If Lina interjected, it was only about minor disagreements, things that were barely mentioned and never amounted to strong opposition. I thought about it, but there had never been any real conflict between us.\n[1963-07-20T15:20:00] Beach | One afternoon, I saw him mention an article that strongly criticized the operation of public schools, and then he immediately brought up the elementary school we both attended, Mergellina, and said that school was terrible.\n[1963-07-20T15:25:00] Beach | I agreed with his view, saying that when we made mistakes, Teacher Oliviero often hit our hands with the ruler, and there were also all those competitions that were forced upon us.\n[1963-07-20T15:30:00] Beach | I saw Lina say that the entire primary education had been very important to her, and she praised our teachers in a Italian that I hadn't heard for a long time. She spoke very accurately and seriously. I thought, but to my surprise.\n[1963-07-20T15:35:00] Beach | I saw that Nino didn't interrupt her, but listened very carefully. In the end, he gave a general summary: Everyone has different needs. The same education can satisfy some people, but for others, it might not be enough.\n[1963-07-21 10:00:00] Barano | I spent most of my time on the rooftop wearing clothes. I thought about the beginning, because my mother had filled me with so much fear, plus my own rejection of my body.\n[1963-07-21T15:00:00] Beach | I saw it once more, when Lina politely voiced her objections, using very standard Italian.\n[1963-07-21T15:05:00] Beach | I thought of a viewpoint that I increasingly agree with: that effective intervention in society during certain periods might resolve some issues, eliminate social injustices and various conflicts.\n[1963-07-21T15:10:00] Beach | Every time Nino brought up a question he had seen in this book or that magazine—colonialism, neocolonialism, and the problem of Africa—I applied this pattern to analyze it. I thought about how I quickly learned this method of analysis—and in this, I have always been good.\n[1963-07-21T15:15:00] Beach | I remember that one afternoon, Lina slowly told him that there was no way to avoid the conflict between the rich and the poor.\n[1963-07-21T15:15:05] Beach | I heard \"Why?\"\n\"Those below want to rise up, and those above want to stay on top. No matter how, the end result is mutual hatred and beating each other senseless.\"\n[1963-07-21T15:15:10] Beach | \"I heard, 'That's precisely why we need to resolve the issue before a violent incident occurs.'  \n'How do you resolve it? Drag everyone up, or crush everyone down?\"\n[1963-07-21T15:15:15] Beach | I heard, \"We need to find a balance among all social classes.\"  \n\"Where is the balance point? Will the people below and the people above meet in the middle?\"  \n\"In a way, yes.\"\n[1963-07-21T15:15:20] Beach | \"I heard, 'Are those above willing to come down a bit? Are those below giving up the hope of reaching the top?'\"\n\"If all problems are solved through effort, this result will be achieved. What do you think?\"\n[1963-07-21T15:15:25] Beach | I heard, \"I don't think so. These classes won't just play cards with each other; they'll fight, until they've bled to the last drop of blood.\"  \n\"That's Pasquale's idea,\" I said.\n[1963-07-21T15:15:30] Beach | I saw her calmly reply. I heard, \"Now I think that way too.\"\n[1963-07-21T15:30:00] Beach | I saw that except for a few face-to-face conversations, Lina and Nino's communication was mostly through me. I know that Lina never speaks directly to Nino, and Nino is the same, as if they both feel embarrassed around each other.\n[1963-07-21T15:30:05] Beach | I thought that when Lina was with Bruno, she never felt this awkwardness. Although Bruno didn't talk much, he was polite, calling her Mrs. Carracci in a gentle way, which gave them a sense of familiarity and closeness.\n[1963-07-21T15:40:00] Beach | I remember once when we were all swimming together. I thought it was surprising that Nino didn't swim as far as usual, which worried me a lot.\n[1963-07-21T15:45:00] Beach | I saw Lina ask Bruno, not Nino, to demonstrate to her when she needed to lift her head to breathe while swimming.\n[1963-07-21T15:45:05] Beach | I saw Bruno immediately demonstrated it again, and Nino was very upset because he was good at swimming yet hadn't been chosen. He made fun of Bruno, saying his arms were too short and his rhythm was bad when he swam.\n[1963-07-21T15:50:00] Beach | I saw and then he demonstrated the correct posture to Lina. She watched very carefully and immediately started swimming in his imitation.\n[1963-07-21T16:00:00] Beach | I saw it all, and Bruno called Lina the Esther Williams of Vomero; he wanted to say that she swam beautifully, just like a swimming goddess in the movies.\n[1963-07-22 10:00:00] Barano | I saw myself writing a letter to Lina every day, filled with questions, witty remarks, and descriptions of the island, all bursting with excited exclamations.\n[1963-07-22T09:00:00] On the way to the beach | I remember that by the end of that week, it was a very clear Saturday morning, the air was cool, and along the way, there was a strong scent of pine trees.\n[1963-07-22T09:10:00] Beach | I saw that as soon as we arrived at the beach, Pinocchio spoke plainly. I heard, \"Nino's son is really unbearable.\"\n[1963-07-22T09:10:05] Beach | I saw that I had very carefully defended him, speaking in a measured tone, saying that when a person is learning, he develops a passion for certain things and feels the need to pass on his enthusiasm to others — that was exactly the kind of person he was.\n[1963-07-22T09:10:10] Beach | I heard, \"If you took everything Nino had read out of his mind, there would be nothing left.\" I thought Lina didn't really approve of me; she said something that felt really harsh to me.\n[1963-07-22T09:10:15] Beach | I saw I was about to retaliate and said. I heard, \"It's not like that. I know him. He has many good qualities.\"\n[1963-07-22T09:10:20] Beach | I saw Pinocchia enthusiastically supporting Lina's opinion. I thought, but Lina didn't like Pinocchio's approval.\n[1963-07-22T09:10:25] Beach | I saw that she didn't mean what she said, and she immediately turned the sentence around, as if she had spoken it just to test something. Now, listening to her, it seemed she was sorry for what she had just said and was trying hard to take it back.\n[1963-07-22T09:10:30] Beach | I heard her explain that people like him always think about big issues, and if possible, he could devote his whole life to them without being disturbed by others, unlike us, who are always thinking about our own problems: money, family, husbands, [childbearing status].\n[1963-07-22T09:10:35] Beach | I thought I still didn't like the things she was saying. What was she talking about? Would Nino never develop feelings for someone? Was his life destined to be without love, without children and marriage?\n[1963-07-22T09:10:40] Beach | I saw myself gathering the courage to speak. I heard, \"Do you know he has a girlfriend, someone he cares very much about? They write to each other every week.\"\n[1963-07-22T09:10:45] Beach | I saw Pinocchio inserted a sentence. I heard, \"Bruno doesn't have a girlfriend. He's looking for the woman of his dreams. Once he finds the woman he wants, he'll want to get married and have lots of children.\"\n[1963-07-22T09:10:50] Beach | I sighed, speaking incoherently after seeing it. I heard, \"This week has passed by so quickly!\"  \n\"Are you not happy? Your husband is coming soon,\" I replied.\n[1963-07-22T09:11:00] Beach | I saw her look as if she'd been offended. The words made her remember that Rino was coming back, and perhaps also some thing she disliked, so she sighed listlessly. I heard, \"Of course I'm happy.\"\n[1963-07-22T09:11:05] Beach | I heard Lina ask me then, \"Are you happy?\"  \n\"Because your husbands are coming back?\"  \n\"No, you know it yourself.\"\n[1963-07-22T09:11:10] Beach | I thought I understood what she meant, but I didn't acknowledge it.\n[1963-07-22T09:11:15] Beach | I thought about what she meant: tomorrow, which was Sunday, they would be with Stefano and Rino, and I would have the chance to meet the two boys alone. It was a good opportunity, just like last week, when Bruno would be occupied with his own things, and I would spend the afternoon with Nino.\n[1963-07-22T09:11:20] Beach | I've been thinking about this all week, and every night before I go to sleep, I imagine what will happen over the weekend.\n[1963-07-22T09:11:25] Beach | I thought about how Lina and Pinochietta would enjoy their married life. As a single woman, even though I wore glasses and spent my days reading, I too would have my own small happiness: walking hand in hand with Nino through the town, perhaps even more than that.\n[1963-07-22T09:11:30] Beach | I saw myself smiling and saying something. \"I heard, 'Lina, what should I know? Are married women happy?'\"\n[1963-07-22T14:00:00] Beach | I watched that day pass slowly, and I lay quietly with Lina on the beach, waiting for Nino and Bruno to bring us cold drinks.\n[1963-07-22T14:30:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchia's mood getting clearly worse, she was saying more and more irrational things, sometimes saying she thought they wouldn't come after all, other times lamenting that we couldn't waste time waiting for them.\n[1963-07-22T15:00:00] Beach | I saw the two boys arrive on time, still carrying their cold drinks.\n[1963-07-22T15:10:00] Beach | I saw her acting irritable. She said she felt tired, but a few minutes later her mood seemed to get worse. She changed her mind and sighed, saying she was going to buy a coconut.\n[1963-07-22T15:30:00] Beach | I saw that as for Lina, she did something I really disliked. Throughout the whole week, she never mentioned the book I lent her, and I had almost forgotten all about it.\n[1963-07-22T15:30:05] Beach | As soon as Bambino and Bruno left, she didn't wait for Nino to speak, but came straight to the point. I heard, \"Have you ever been to the theater?\"  \n\"Yes, a few times.\"  \n\"Do you like it?\"  \n\"Kind of.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:30:10] Beach | \"I never went, but I've seen it on TV.\"  \n\"That's not the same thing.\"  \n\"I know, but it's better than never seeing it at all.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:30:15] Beach | I saw that at that moment, she took out the book I had given her, Beckett's collection of plays, and showed it to Nino, asking him. I heard, \"Have you read this book?\"\n[1963-07-22T15:30:20] Beach | I saw Nino take the book, look at it carefully, then uncomfortably admit. I heard, \"No.\"  \n\"So you aren't all-knowing after all.\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"You should take a look at this book.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:35:00] Beach | I saw Lina start talking about the book. What surprised me was that she had put a lot of effort into this book. She used the same method as before, choosing words that allowed us to see the essence of people and things, describing the feelings these events had stirred in her. Now she made these people and things come alive before our eyes.\n[1963-07-22T15:35:05] Beach | I saw her say that we didn't have to wait for nuclear war to break out, as if in that book, the nuclear war had already happened.\n[1963-07-22T15:40:00] Beach | I saw her telling us about Mrs. Wynn, and she sighed: \"Another extraordinary day!\" As she repeated the words, the effect was very powerful; her voice trembled as she said: \"Another extraordinary day!\" I can't stand hearing those words!\n[1963-07-22T15:40:05] Beach | I saw her explaining to us why there was nothing in Winny's life, nothing at all. Her movements were empty, her mind was empty. Not a single day, not even the days before, was extraordinary.\n[1963-07-22T15:45:00] Beach | I saw her, but she added that what moved her the most was a man named Dan Rooney.",

    "text": "[1963-07-22T15:45:05] Beach | I saw her say that Dan Rooney was blind, but he didn't feel regretful, because not seeing made his life better. One day, he thought, if he had become deaf and mute, would his life be even more like real life—a pure life, a life that was only life.\n[1963-07-22T15:46:00] Beach | I heard Nino ask, \"Why do you like this character?\"  \n\"I don't know if I really like him now.\"  \n\"Isn't he arousing your curiosity?\"\n[1963-07-22T15:46:05] Beach | \"I heard, 'He made me think of a lot—meaning, if you couldn't see, couldn't hear, and even lost your language, what would life be like? What does that even mean?'\"\n\"Maybe it was just a strategy.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:46:10] Beach | I heard him say, \"No, it's not some kind of strategy. It makes you think of a lot of things—this isn't just a way of expressing something.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:47:00] Beach | I saw that Nino was silent, he just looked at the book's cover as if trying to carefully recognize it. I heard him ask, \"Have you finished reading it?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Can I borrow it to take a look?\"\n[1963-07-22T15:47:05] Beach | I thought about the request, and it made me feel extremely painful and uneasy.\n[1963-07-22T15:47:10] Beach | I thought of Nino, who once said—though I don't remember exactly—that he wasn't really interested in literature. He read other kinds of books. I gave the Beckett to Lina precisely because I knew I would never get a chance to talk to him about it.\n[1963-07-22T15:47:15] Beach | I saw that now Lina was talking to him about the book, and not only was he listening very carefully, but he also wanted to borrow it.\n[1963-07-22T15:47:20] Beach | I heard myself say, \"It's Galiani's book, I lent it to her.\"  \n\"Did you read it?\" he asked me.\n[1963-07-22T15:47:25] Beach | I wanted to say I hadn't read it, but I immediately added. I heard, \"I want to start reading tonight.\"  \n\"Then show it to me after you finish.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:47:30] Beach | \"I heard 'If you're really that interested,' \" I immediately said, \"then read first.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:48:00] Beach | I saw Nino thanking me, he used his fingernail to scrape off the corpse of a mosquito from the cover, and said to Lina. I heard, \"I can finish this book in one night, and tomorrow we can talk about it.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:48:05] Beach | I heard, \"Tomorrow isn't possible, we can't meet tomorrow.\"  \n\"Why?\"  \n\"Tomorrow I'll be with my husband.\"  \n\"Oh.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:48:10] Beach | I waited there, neither here nor there, for a while, hoping he would ask me if we'd see each other tomorrow. I thought he was a bit troubled.\n[1963-07-22T15:48:15] Beach | I saw him, but he suddenly became very impatient and said. I heard, \"I won't be able to come tomorrow. Bruno's parents are here, I have to go stay in Barano, and I won't be back until Monday.\"\n[1963-07-22T15:48:20] Beach | I thought of Balano? Monday? I hope he'll tell me to meet him at the Maronti beach.\n[1963-07-22T15:48:25] Beach | I saw it all, and he never invited me. I thought about him, but he was distracted, probably still thinking about Dan Rooney—the character didn't want to just be blind, he also wanted to become deaf and mute.\n[1963-07-22T18:00:00] On the way home | I said to Lina on the way home. \"I heard, 'The book I lent you isn't mine either. I beg you not to bring it to the beach. I can't return the book to Professor Galiani with sand inside it.'\"\n[1963-07-22T18:00:05] On the way home | I saw it and then happily kissed my cheek, maybe to gain my forgiveness, she offered to carry my bag with Pinocchio. I heard \"I'm sorry.\" she said.\n[1963-07-22T18:05:00] On the way home | I felt my mood gradually brighten. I didn't think Nino had just said he was going to Balano on a whim—he wanted me to know where he was, to take the initiative and go find him in Balano. That's just the way he is.\n[1963-07-22T18:05:05] On the way home | I felt relieved when I thought about it—I realized he needed to be followed, and I decided to get up early tomorrow morning to find him.\n[1963-07-22T18:10:00] On the way home | I know she usually gets angry easily, but she also calms down quickly. After [her reproductive state], not only did her body become rounder, but her personality seemed to have lost some of its sharp edges. The only person whose mood remained terrible was Pinocchia, but for some reason, her face grew darker and darker that day.\n[1963-07-22T18:15:00] On the way home | I saw myself suddenly ask her. I heard, \"Did Bruno say something unpleasant to you?\"  \n\"No, he didn't.\"  \n\"What happened?\"\n[1963-07-22T18:15:05] On the way home | I heard, \"Nothing.\"\n\"Are you feeling unwell?\"\n\"I'm not feeling unwell. I don't even know myself what's wrong with me.\"\n[1963-07-22T18:15:10] On the way home | I heard, \"You'd better get ready, Rino is coming right away.\"  \n\"Okay.\"\n[1963-07-22T18:30:00] Rentals | I saw her, but she still didn't go to prepare. She was still wearing her damp swimsuit, casually flipping through a photo novel there.\n[1963-07-22T18:40:00] Renting House | I saw Lina and I had both dressed up, especially Lina, who still hadn't changed out of her Pinocchio outfit. I saw her dressed up extravagantly, like it was a festival.\n[1963-07-22T18:50:00] Rentals | I saw that at this point, Nunzia had already silently prepared dinner, and she whispered to Pinocchia. I heard, \"What's wrong with you? Girl, aren't you going to change clothes?\" She didn't answer.\n[1963-07-22T19:00:00] Renting House | I saw that when she heard the roar of the \"Lametta\" motorcycle and the voices of two young men calling out, Pinocchia hurriedly ran into the bedroom, shut the door, and shouted. I heard, \"Don't let him in, please.\"\n[1963-07-22T19:30:00] Renting House | I saw that throughout the whole evening, we were all uneasy, each person troubled for different reasons, and in the end, this unease also spread to their husbands.\n[1963-07-22T19:40:00] Renting house | I saw it, but to his surprise, Lina was now tender and soft, as if she was enjoying his touch and the intimate act, unlike her usual self, who always seemed annoyed. I thought that Stefano had already grown accustomed to Lina's mood swings.\n[1963-07-22T19:45:00] Rentals | I saw that Rino had already gotten used to Pinocchia's sticky, clinging way of being around him, but now that she was pregnant, she was even more clingy than before. I thought of him, but this time he felt unhappy because his wife didn't run down the stairs to meet him.\n[1963-07-22T19:50:00] Renting House | I saw it end with him going into the room to find her. When he embraced her, he felt that she was forcing herself to look happy.\n[1963-07-22T20:30:00] Renting House | I saw that, not only that, after a few drinks, Lina became very cheerful, and the two young men began to tease their respective wives with suggestive remarks.\n[1963-07-22T20:35:00] Renting House | I saw Rino smiling and saying something in Pinocchio's ear. She suddenly stepped back and said, in a dialect that had the accent of standard Italian. I heard, \"Don't act like that, you're too vulgar!\"\n[1963-07-22T20:35:05] Renting House | I saw Rino lose her temper; she kept insisting for a few more minutes before finally running into the room with trembling lips. I heard, \"I'm vulgar? Vulgar?\"\n[1963-07-22T20:40:00] Renting House | I saw no one responding. I heard her say, \"It's all because of her reproductive state.\" Nunzia said, \"Be patient with her.\"\n[1963-07-22T21:00:00] Rentals | I saw Rino finish his meal, then he sighed and went to his wife's room, and never came out again.\n[1963-07-22T21:10:00] Renting House | I saw Lina and Stefano decide to ride their \"Lametta\" motorcycle for a quick spin, to look at the beach under the night sky.\n[1963-07-22T21:15:00] Rentals | I saw them leave with smiling faces, kissing each other affectionately.\n[1963-07-22T21:30:00] Renting House | I saw myself, as usual, fighting with Nunzia to clear the table, and Nunzia always refused to let me help.",

I heard, \"You may love someone for a lifetime, but you don't really know that person.\"\n[1963-07-22T22:05:00] Renting House | I saw Fernando sometimes, but she always loved him, of course, and sometimes she even hated him, she emphasized again. I heard her say, \"So there's nothing to worry about. Pinocchio is in a bad mood now, but she'll be fine soon. Do you remember how Lina looked when she came back from her honeymoon? Hey, look at her now! That's how women are all their lives—sometimes beaten, sometimes favored.\"\n[1963-07-22T22:30:00] Renting house | I found myself back in my small room, trying to finish reading Zhaduo's book. I thought of Nino, and I remembered the look on his face when he listened to Lina telling the story of Donato. He was completely captivated, which made me not want to waste my time on Zapponi's \"idea of a national state.\"\n[1963-07-22T22:35:00] Rentals | I thought about Nino, how fickle he was, and I realized it would be hard for me to figure out what kind of person he really was. He seemed to have no interest in literature at all, but when Lina took a book on drama and said a few words about it, he suddenly became interested in literature.\n[1963-07-22T22:40:00] Rentals | I looked through the books I had brought, searching for other literary works, but didn't find any.\n[1963-07-22T22:45:00] Renting House | I saw that although I hadn't found any literary books, I discovered that one of my books was missing. How could that be? Teacher Galiani gave me six books.\n[1963-07-22T22:46:00] Rentals | I thought about it: Nino has one, I'm currently reading one, there are three on the marble windowsill, where is the sixth book?\n[1963-07-22T22:50:00] Rentals | I looked everywhere, even under the bed, and then I remembered—it was a book about Hiroshima. I thought I was very uneasy, it must have been when I was taking a shower that Lina came and took the book.\n[1963-07-22T22:55:00] Rentals | What happened? After going through the shoemaker's workshop, the engagement, the love affair, Capodimonte, and dealing with the Solara family, she now decides to go back to how she was in elementary school?\n[1963-07-22T22:55:05] Rentals | I thought, of course, there had already been signs: the bet she made with me, although the outcome wasn't what she had hoped for, it was certainly clear that she had shown me her desire to learn.\n[1963-07-22T22:55:10] Renting house | I thought about it, but what happened later? Did she really get back to her studies? No.\n[1963-07-22T22:55:15] Rentals | I thought about how, after our casual chat with Nino on the beach, and after six afternoons spent sunbathing on the beach, all of this had reignited her desire to learn, had given her back the urge to compete. That's why she spoke highly of Professor Oliviero? That's why she'd developed an interest in this man, who was passionate only about big things and not much concerned with real life, finding him handsome?\n[1963-07-22T23:00:00] Rentals | I saw myself quietly leaving my room, walking on tiptoe, and gently opening the door to avoid it creaking.\n[1963-07-22T23:05:00] Elena's Room | I saw myself entering their room. I saw that the house was very quiet, Nunzia had already gone to bed, and Stefano and Lina hadn't returned yet. The room was in a mess, with clothes, shoes, and luggage scattered everywhere.\n[1963-07-22T23:06:00] Lina's Room | I saw the book—the \"Day After Hiroshima.\" I saw it on a bench.\n[1963-07-22T23:07:00] Lina's Room | I thought about how she hadn't even asked before taking the book, as if my books were hers too, as if I owed her something, as if Professor Galiani's concern for my studies was all because of one careless gesture, one offhand remark she made.\n[1963-07-22T23:08:00] Lina's Room | I wanted to take the book, but I felt a bit ashamed, so I changed my mind and put it back where it was.\n[1963-07-23 09:00:00] Barano | I remember one morning, Elena joked with me, \"What are you doing? You have to put on a swimsuit.\"\n[1963-07-23 09:10:00] Barano | I saw her laugh again when I put on my swimsuit. I thought the style was too outdated.\n[1963-07-23 15:00:00] Barano | I saw her sew me a swimsuit she thought was very fashionable: lower in the chest, tighter around the hips, in blue.\n[1963-07-23 15:10:00] Barano | I saw her try it on, and she was very excited. I heard that I should go down to the sea, and shouldn't stay on the rooftop all the time.\n[1963-07-23T02:00:00] Renting House | I felt the whole night was very hot. I knew it was an unusually boring Sunday.\n[1963-07-23T04:00:00] Rentals | I didn't dare to open the window because I was worried about mosquitoes getting in, so I slept for a while, then woke up again.\n[1963-07-23T05:00:00] Rentals | I wondered if I should go to Balano. What would happen if I did? I'd spend the whole day playing with Ciro, Pino, and Clelia. Would Nino swim far away as usual, or would he stay alone in the sun, saying nothing, silently resisting his father?\n[1963-07-23T10:00:00] Rentals | I woke up very late; when I opened my eyes, it was already ten o'clock. I thought of something that made me feel a distant longing, and it made me very uneasy.\n[1963-07-23T10:10:00] Renting House | I saw that from Nunzia's mouth, Pinocchio and Rino had already gone to the sea, while Stefano and Lina were still sleeping.\n[1963-07-23T10:10:05] Beach | I felt especially anxious about Pinocchio, because when she slept, her hair got all messed up.\n[1963-07-23T10:15:00] Beach | I saw that Nino hadn't yet explained why he hadn't come at his usual time, when Pinocchia spoke up first. I heard her speak to Nino in a harsh, even menacing tone: \"Why didn't Bruno come? Does he have something more interesting to do?\"\n[1963-07-23T10:15:05] Beach | \"I heard, 'His parents are home, they're leaving at noon.'\"\n\"Will he come after his parents leave?\"\n\"Probably.\"\n[1963-07-23T10:15:10] Beach | I heard, \"If he doesn't come, I'm going back to bed. Being with the three of you is driving me crazy.\"\n[1963-07-23T10:20:00] Renting house | I watched myself soaking the bread in milk coffee, chewing mechanically. In the end, I completely gave up on going to Balano. I felt a bit anxious and went to the beach in a low mood.\n[1963-07-23T10:25:00] Beach | When I saw Nino talking, Pinocchia interrupted him two or three times, full of resentment, asking us who would go swimming with her.\n[1963-07-23T10:30:00] Beach | I saw that neither I nor Lina paid any attention to her, so she sulked and went underground by herself.\n[1963-07-23T10:35:00] Beach | I saw, let her go! We were more willing to listen to Nino list all the faults of his father. I heard \"He's a cheat.\" That was Nino's definition of his father.\n[1963-07-23T10:40:00] Beach | I saw Rino sleeping in the sun on the beach, and Pinocchia walking back and forth on the sand. I saw Rino's hair was very wet, his bulky body lying on the sand.\n[1963-07-23T10:45:00] Beach | I saw myself convincing her to walk with me to the hot springs, and she politely declined.\n[1963-07-23T10:45:05] Beach | I saw him then feel a bit awkward, as if he had just realized that his bold display in front of me might have offended Lina. I heard him say, \"Can I also [intimate act] you?\"  \n\"Of course,\" Lina answered.\n[1963-07-23T10:45:10] Beach | I saw him gently [intimate gesture] Lina, making no sound, just lightly touching her lips with his.\n[1963-07-23T11:00:00] Beach | I saw myself walking alone under the sun toward Mergellina. I thought about trying to calm myself down.\n[1963-07-23T11:05:00] Beach | I thought, well, if a person went blind, deaf, mute, even lost their sense of taste and touch, they might feel life more truly. That idea itself is very interesting.\n[1963-07-23T11:05:05] Beach | I thought that according to his explanation, the author meant: we need to remove all the filters that prevent us from living in the present moment in order to fully enjoy real life.\n[1963-07-23T11:10:00] Beach | I saw Lina acting very uneasy. She said she had imagined it, and the idea of a \"pure state of life\" frightened her. I heard her exclaim dramatically, \"A life that cannot see, cannot speak, cannot express, cannot listen— a life without any attachment, any vessel—is a distorted life.\"\n[1963-07-23T11:10:05] Beach | I saw that I couldn't remember her exact words. I thought, but I was certain that when she said the word \"transformation,\" she made a very annoyed gesture.\n[1963-07-23T11:15:00] Beach | I saw Nino muttering the word—\"transformation\"—again and again, as if it were a curse.\n[1963-07-23T11:20:00] Beach | I saw him analyzing again later, more excited than before. Eventually, he suddenly took off his sweat-soaked shirt, grabbed our hands, and pulled us into the water. I saw his thin, dark body exposed.\n[1963-07-23T11:21:00] Beach | I cried out with great happiness at that moment, and Lina was laughing. I heard, \"No, no, don't, I'm cold, don't do this.\"  \nHe replied, \"We've finally had an extraordinary day.\"\n[1963-07-23T11:25:00] Beach | I thought to myself at that moment, maybe Lina was wrong. There really was another Nino: not the brooding boy—the one who obsessed over the fate of the world and humanity—but this boy right here, a boy who knew how to have fun and would pull us all into the mess with him.\n[1963-07-23T11:25:05] Beach | I thought of the boy who grabbed us, pushed us, and pulled us toward him; the boy who swam away, making us chase him, make us catch him, and pretend to drown him underwater.\n[1963-07-23T12:00:00] Beach | I found the morning dragging on painfully. After returning from Mergellina, I went for a swim and then lay in the sun.\n[1963-07-23T12:30:00] Beach | I heard Rino and Pinocchia talking, as if I wasn't even there, murmuring to each other.\n[1963-07-23T12:30:05] Beach | I heard, \"Don't go.\"  \n\"I have to work, those shoes should be finished before autumn. Have you seen them? Do you like them?\"  \n\"Yes, but the decoration Lina added later is ugly, take it off.\"\n[1963-07-23T12:30:10] Beach | \"I heard, 'It looks good, don't take it off.'\"  \n\"Did you see? What I said to you doesn't matter at all.\"  \n\"It's not like that.\"  \n\"Yes, it is. You don't love me anymore.\"\n[1963-07-23T12:30:15] Beach | I heard, \"I love you, you know how much I like you.\"  \n\"Not true, look at my stomach.\"  \n\"I'll kiss your stomach a million times, I've been thinking about you all week.\"  \n\"So just don't go to work then.\"\n[1963-07-23T12:30:20] Beach | I heard \"No.\"  \n\"That means we have to go together tonight.\"  \n\"We've already paid our share, you should be on vacation here.\"  \n\"I don't want to vacation anymore.\"\n[1963-07-23T12:30:25] Beach | I heard \"Why?\"  \n\"Because whenever I close my eyes, I have nightmares. I'll keep them open all night.\"  \n\"Do you do the same when you sleep with my sister?\"  \n\"Even worse. My sister would kill me, she's definitely thinking about killing me.\"\n[1963-07-23T12:30:30] Beach | I heard, \"Then you'll sleep with my mother.\"\n\"She snores.\"\n[1963-07-23T12:35:00] Beach | I thought about Pinocchio's tone, which had become increasingly unbearable; all day long, I couldn't understand her resentment.\n[1963-07-23T12:35:05] Beach | I thought she really couldn't sleep well, that she wanted Rino to stay, that she even wanted to go back with him. I felt she was lying.\n[1963-07-23T12:35:10] Beach | I thought about it later, and I felt she must have wanted to tell Rino something, something she couldn't say directly, so she had to express it in an unreasonable and stubborn way.\n[1963-07-23T12:40:00] Beach | I thought about it, but then I didn't dwell on her little quirks. I was thinking of other things, and the first thing that came to mind was Lina's energy and cheerfulness.\n[1963-07-23T13:00:00] Beach | I saw Lina and her husband appear on the beach. I thought she seemed even happier than the night before.\n[1963-07-23T13:05:00] Beach | I saw her trying to show Stefano that she had learned to swim, and the two of them swam far out—out to the deep sea, according to Stefano—though in reality they were only a few meters from the shore.\n[1963-07-23T13:10:00] Beach | I watched Lina's movements, which were very graceful and precise, full of rhythm. She had learned to turn her head and surface for air from the water. She quickly left her husband behind.\n[1963-07-23T13:15:00] Beach | I saw her stop and smile as she waited for him. He awkwardly swung his arms, his neck stretched straight, blowing on his face to get the water off, struggling to catch up with her.\n[1963-07-23T14:00:00] Beach | I saw them riding their \"Lametta\" motorcycle for a ride. I noticed that the cheerful atmosphere grew even more intense in the afternoon.\n[1963-07-23T14:05:00] Beach | I saw that Rino also wanted to go for a ride, but Pinocchia refused; she was afraid of falling off the motorcycle and losing the baby.\n[1963-07-23T14:05:05] Beach | I saw my first time riding a motorcycle, with Stefano driving in front and Rino behind. I heard Rino say to me, \"Elena, come with me.\"\n[1963-07-23T14:10:00] On the motorcycle | I saw, in the wind, the strong scent coming from Pinocchio's husband's sweaty back. I thought about how I was afraid of falling down or hitting something, and I felt increasingly excited.\n[1963-07-23T14:20:00] On the motorcycle | I saw him respond to the protesters using our Mergellina method—suddenly braking, shouting threats, ready to fight anyone at a moment's notice, all to defend his right to do whatever he wanted. I thought of that arrogant attitude, which had made him break all the rules.\n[1963-07-23T14:30:00] On the motorcycle | I thought it was a very interesting experience, taking me back to the unrefined days of a young girl, completely different from how I had acted that afternoon on the beach when Nino and his friends appeared.",

    "text": "[1963-07-23T16:00:00] Rentals | I remember that Sunday, I often mentioned the two boys, especially liking to speak of Nino's name.\n[1963-07-23T16:10:00] Renting Room | I thought to myself that I had quickly noticed how Pinocchia and Lina acted as if they had never been involved with Bruno and Nino, as if only I had been involved with them.\n[1963-07-23T17:00:00] Dockyard | I saw the final result was that when their husbands said goodbye to us and went to the dock to take the boat, Stefano asked me to greet the son of Soca, as if I were the only one who had a chance to see him.\n[1963-07-23T17:05:00] Wharf | I saw Rino joking with me. I heard, \"Do you like the son of the poet or the son of the sausage merchant? Which one do you think is more handsome?\" I thought that just like his wife and sister, they couldn't make a judgment on this.\n[1963-07-23T18:00:00] Renting House | I thought about what annoyed me was the way the two of them behaved after their husbands left.\n[1963-07-23T18:10:00] Renting House | I saw Pinocchio become very happy; she felt it was necessary to wash her hair—she loudly said there was sand in her hair.\n[1963-07-23T19:00:00] Rentals | I saw Lina wandering around the house in a bad mood, and finally she lay down on the unmade bed, letting the room stay messy.\n[1963-07-23T21:00:00] Renting House | I saw myself going to her room to say goodnight, and I saw her still fully dressed, her eyes half-closed, her brow furrowed, completely absorbed in that book about Hiroshima.\n[1963-07-23T21:05:00] Renting House | I saw that I didn't say it to her, just spoke in a somewhat sarcastic tone. I heard, \"Why did you suddenly feel like reading again?\"  \n\"None of your business,\" she replied to me.\n[1963-07-24 09:00:00] Malonto Beach | I saw the next day, and I set aside all my fear and doubt. I took a towel and a book and walked toward Maronti Beach.\n[1963-07-24 09:20:00] Malongti Beach | I thought to myself that the road was long, and I didn't meet anyone going up or down.\n[1963-07-24 09:30:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw the beach as if it had no end, empty and vast, with large grains of sand that squeaked with every step I took.\n[1963-07-24 09:30:10] Malongti Beach | I saw the sea emitting a strong odor, along with a dry, monotonous sound.\n[1963-07-24 09:30:20] Malongdi Beach | I saw that I had been standing there for a long time. I saw before me a vast expanse of water.\n[1963-07-24 09:30:30] Malonto Beach | I saw her later sitting helplessly on the towel.\n[1963-07-24 09:35:00] Malonto Beach | I saw it to the end, then I stood up and got my feet wet.\n[1963-07-24 09:35:10] Malonto Beach | I think about how I lived in a city like San Gregorio Armeno, yet I never once thought of going for a swim. But that's exactly what happened.\n[1963-07-24 09:36:00] Malonto Beach | I watched myself carefully stepping forward, letting the water flow over my ankles, then my thighs. Finally, I lost my balance and fell into the water.\n[1963-07-24 09:36:10] Malongti Beach | I saw myself struggling in fear, drinking some seawater, and then returning to the surface to breathe air.\n[1963-07-24 09:36:20] Malonti Beach | I saw what I had discovered, and I naturally moved my arms and legs, rising up. I thought, so I am able to swim.\n[1963-07-24 09:36:30] Malonto Beach | I thought about how my mother really brought me to the sea when I was very young, and while she had her sand baths, I learned to swim.\n[1963-07-24 09:36:40] Malongdi Beach | I thought I suddenly saw her, younger then, not so ugly.\n[1963-07-24 09:36:50] Malonto Beach | I saw, or rather, I thought I saw her sitting on the beach, sunburned in the noon sun.\n[1963-07-24 09:37:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw that I remembered her wearing a white flowered dress, the good leg covered by the skirt all the way to her knees, while the faulty leg was buried under the scorching sand.\n[1963-07-24T10:00:00] Beach | I knew that from that moment on, for the entire following week, it felt completely natural for the two boys to come looking for us at ten in the morning.\n[1963-07-24T19:00:00] Beach | I saw us staying on the beach until the sun set. I heard until we said, \"We should go, otherwise Nunzia will get angry.\" They also took the opportunity to say they needed to go back and study for a while.\n[1963-07-25T15:00:00] Beach | I saw that if Bruno joked with Lina, calling her Mrs. Karachi, she would punch his shoulder and then run after him. I thought about how close we had become.\n[1963-07-25T15:10:00] Beach | I saw that if he paid a lot of attention to Pinocchia because she was pregnant, Pinocchia would let him put his hand on her shoulder. I heard him say, \"Let's go, I want a soda.\"\n[1963-07-25T15:20:00] Beach | I saw that as for Nino, he now often took my hand and put one arm over my shoulder and the other over Lina's, catching her index finger and thumb with his hand.\n[1963-07-25T16:00:00] Beach | I saw that in the end, the five of us became cheerful and easily happy companions. I thought about how the boundaries between us were disappearing.\n[1963-07-25T16:10:00] Beach | I watched us play all sorts of games, and whoever lost had to be punished. I know that usually the person who gets punished has to kiss someone, but that kind of playful intimate gesture.\n[1963-07-25T16:15:00] Beach | I know, for example: Bruno wants to kiss Lina's feet covered in sand, Nino wants to kiss my hands, cheeks, forehead, ears, or hit the back of my ears.\n[1963-07-25T16:30:00] Beach | I saw that we were still playing the ball game, and Lina was very good at it, as was Nino. I know, but the most energetic and fun-loving person is Bruno; he and Pinocchia always win.\n[1963-07-25T16:35:00] Beach | I saw that no matter whether they were playing with me and Lina, or Lina and Nino, or Nino and me, they always won. I thought about how we all had reached an unspoken agreement in front of Pinocchio.\n[1963-07-25T16:40:00] Beach | I watched her running, rushing, rolling in the sand, completely forgetting her condition. We quickly ended the game, letting her win, just to calm her down.\n[1963-07-25T16:45:00] Beach | I saw Bruno kindly persuade her to sit down, then he called out. I heard, \"Pinochia scores, great!\"\n[1963-07-25T17:00:00] Beach | I saw it like that, day by day, a kind of happiness began to spread. I used to be annoyed when Lina borrowed my books, but now I don't mind at all—I even think it's a beautiful thing.\n[1963-07-25T17:30:00] Beach | When we were discussing, Lina started to express her own ideas, and Nino was listening carefully, as if he couldn't find anything to argue against, which also made me feel good. I thought that what made me so happy was that, in those situations, he would suddenly stop talking to her and start discussing with me instead, as if doing so helped him regain his own thoughts.\n[1963-07-26T15:00:00] Beach | I remember once when Lina talked about the book she had read about Hiroshima, something similar happened.\n[1963-07-26T15:05:00] Beach | I know the discussion sparked by that book was very intense. I thought about how, because I knew Nino was critical of America, he didn't like the military base they had established in San Gregorio Armeno, but he was also deeply attracted by their way of life. He said he wanted to study it.\n[1963-07-26T15:10:00] Beach | I felt hurt when Lina said that the atomic bombing of Japan by the United States was a crime, even more serious than a military crime, and had little to do with war anymore—it was an attack on dignity.\n[1963-07-26T15:15:00] Beach | I saw him speak very carefully. I heard, \"Do you remember the Pearl Harbor incident?\"\n[1963-07-26T15:20:00] Beach | I didn't know what the Pearl Harbor incident was, but I found out that Lina did.\n[1963-07-26T15:25:00] Beach | I saw her telling Nino that the nature of the Pearl Harbor incident and the Hiroshima incident were completely different and couldn't be compared. Pearl Harbor was a very despicable military operation, but Hiroshima was a very foolish and terrible act of revenge, even worse than revenge—it was a Nazi massacre.\n[1963-07-26T15:30:00] Beach | I saw her conclude with that. I heard him say, \"Americans should be sent to a military tribunal as the most despicable war criminals. The terrible things they did were only meant to scare the people who are still alive and make them completely submit.\"\n[1963-07-26T15:35:00] Beach | I saw that in this heated discussion, Nino didn't retaliate but instead fell into a troubled silence. I thought, and then he spoke to me as if Lina wasn't even there.\n[1963-07-26T15:40:00] Beach | I saw him say that the incident itself was not driven by cruelty or revenge, but to end that brutal war once and for all, precisely through this new type of weapon that would end all wars.\n[1963-07-26T15:45:00] Beach | I saw him speaking in a low voice, his eyes locked on mine, as if he cared only for my approval. I thought it was a very beautiful moment.\n[1963-07-26T15:50:00] Beach | I was so excited at that moment that tears burst from my eyes and I could hardly hold them back. I thought he was very handsome at that moment.\n[1963-07-26T19:00:00] Beach | I saw that Friday had come again, a very hot day, and we spent most of our time in the water. I thought, suddenly I felt something was broken.\n[1963-07-26T19:30:00] On the way home | I saw us on the way home, just said goodbye to two young men, and the sun was about to set. I saw the blue sky covered with red clouds.\n[1963-07-26T19:35:00] On the way home | After a few hours of high emotion, Pinocchia suddenly became quiet. She threw her bag on the ground and sat by the roadside, shouting angrily — a very quiet shout, almost like a groan.\n[1963-07-26T19:40:00] On the way home | I saw Lina squint her eyes, staring at her sister-in-law. I thought of it as if I were looking at something extremely ugly, something she couldn't bear to face.\n[1963-07-26T19:45:00] On the way home | I saw myself approaching her with some concern and asked. I heard, \"Pinocchio, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?\"  \n\"I can't stand this wet swimsuit.\"  \n\"But our swimsuits are all wet too.\"\n[1963-07-26T19:50:00] On the way home | I heard, \"I can't stand it anymore!\"\n\"Take your time, get up, we're leaving. Aren't you hungry?\"\n\"Don't tell me to take my time! When you say that, it really gets on my nerves. I can't stand you anymore, Elena, and your 'take your time' nonsense.\"\n[1963-07-26T19:55:00] On the way home | I saw her start to cry, patting her thigh as she wept.\n[1963-07-26T20:00:00] On the way home | I saw that Lina hadn't waited for us; she had already walked away alone. I thought to myself that she made this decision not because she was annoyed or indifferent, but because of some deeper, more intense reason—so intense that it seemed to burn her just by being near us.\n[1963-07-26T20:05:00] On the way home | I saw myself helping Pinocchia stand up and holding her bag.",

Lina sighed and then launched into a torrent of insults in the local dialect.\n[1963-07-26T22:00:00] Renting house | I saw the night when Pinocchia decided to sleep in my room.\n[1963-07-26T23:00:00] Rentals | I saw that she was sleeping uneasily. I saw two people staying in such a small room that they couldn't even catch their breath, their clothes soaked through with sweat.\n[1963-07-27 10:00:00] Barano | I saw that the sea and sunlight quickly erased the marks of my acne from my face. I was red all over from the sun, and also got darker.\n[1963-07-27T04:00:00] Renting House | I saw that I later had to open the window, but I was immediately surrounded by mosquitoes. I thought about it so much that I couldn't sleep at all, and as soon as it was light, I got up.\n[1963-07-27T05:00:00] Renting House | I saw three or four mosquito bites on my face, making me feel utterly ashamed to go out. I thought my mood was also very bad now.\n[1963-07-27T05:10:00] Renting House | I saw myself going to the kitchen, and Nunzia was already washing our clothes.\n[1963-07-27T05:15:00] Renting House | I saw that Lina had also gotten up; she had already drunk her milk and was looking at another one of my books. I thought about when she might have taken it.\n[1963-07-27T05:20:00] Renting House | I saw her look at me with a scrutinizing gaze the moment I came in. She made an innocent expression and asked me a question that surprised me. I heard, \"How is Pinocchio?\"  \n\"I don't know.\"\n[1963-07-27T05:25:00] Renting House | I heard, \"You're angry?\"  \n\"Yes, I didn't sleep all night. Look at my face.\"  \n\"I don't see it.\"  \n\"That's because you can't see anything at all.\"\n[1963-07-27T05:30:00] Renting House | I heard, \"Nino and Bruno will also be invisible.\"  \n\"What does that have to do with them?\"  \n\"Are you really concerned about Nino?\"  \n\"I've told you a hundred times, I don't care about him.\"\n[1963-07-27T05:35:00] Renting House | I heard, \"Don't get excited.\"  \n\"I'm perfectly calm.\"  \n\"We have to be careful with Pinocchia.\"  \n\"You have to be careful with her. She's your sister-in-law, not mine.\"  \n\"Are you angry?\"  \n\"Yes, yes, yes.\"\n[1963-07-27T09:00:00] On the way to the beach | I saw us walking nervously toward the beach. I saw that the day was even hotter than the previous one, and our bad moods seemed to spread like an infection, infecting all of us.\n[1963-07-27T09:10:00] On the way to the beach | I saw that on the way, Pinocchia realized she had forgotten her towel and had another fit.\n[1963-07-27T09:15:00] On the way to the beach | I saw Lina walking forward with her head down, not even bothering to look back. \"I'll go get it,\" I volunteered.  \n\"No, I want to go home. I don't want to go to the beach anymore.\"\n[1963-07-27T09:20:00] On the way to the beach | I heard, \"Do you feel unwell?\"  \n\"I'm fine.\"  \n\"Then why?\"  \n\"Look at my stomach.\"\n[1963-07-27T09:25:00] On the way to the beach | I looked at her stomach and, without thinking, said. \"I heard, 'What about me? Look at my face, it's been bitten by mosquitoes so bad.'\"\n[1963-07-27T09:30:00] On the way to the beach | I saw her start shouting, then she quickened her pace and caught up with Lina. I heard her say to me, \"You're an idiot!\"\n[1963-07-27T10:00:00] Beach | I saw that we had reached the beach, and she immediately apologized to me, saying, \"You're so honest, so proper,\" which made me very angry. I heard, \"I'm very honest?\"\n\"I wanted to say you're good.\"\n\"I'm not good at all.\"\n[1963-07-27T10:05:00] Beach | I saw Lina staring at the sea in the direction of Mergellina, trying not to be affected by us. Finally, she said coldly. I heard, \"Stop it, they're coming.\"\n[1963-07-27T10:10:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio mutter, \"Your guest has arrived.\" Suddenly, her voice softened. She applied lipstick to her lips, even though she had already put on plenty.\n[1963-07-27T10:15:00] Beach | I thought about the two boys' feelings, which were even worse than ours.\n[1963-07-27T10:20:00] Beach | I saw Nino speaking to Lina in a mocking tone. I heard, \"Tonight, your husbands are all coming, right?\"  \n\"Of course.\"  \n\"What fun things are you going to do?\"  \n\"We'll eat, drink, and then go to sleep.\"\n[1963-07-27T10:25:00] Beach | I heard, \"What about tomorrow?\"  \n\"Tomorrow we eat, drink, then go to sleep.\"  \n\"Will they be there on Sunday night?\"  \n\"No, on Sunday we eat, drink, and only take a nap in the afternoon.\"\n[1963-07-27T10:30:00] Beach | I saw that I had hidden my self-mocking tone, and I forced myself to speak. I heard, \"I'm free. I don't eat or drink, I don't sleep.\"\n[1963-07-27T10:35:00] Beach | I saw Nino looking at me as if he'd just noticed a problem he'd never seen before. He touched my right cheekbone with one hand, where a mosquito had bitten me and it was swollen more noticeably than the rest.\n[1963-07-27T10:40:00] Beach | I saw him speaking to me very seriously. I heard, \"Well, let's meet here tomorrow morning at seven o'clock, then we'll go hiking together. After that, we'll stay by the sea until late. What do you think?\"\n[1963-07-27T10:45:00] Beach | I felt a wave of joy surging through my veins, and I said quite relieved. \"I heard, 'Okay, seven o'clock in the morning, I'll bring the food.'\"\n[1963-07-27T10:50:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio looking somewhat dejected and asking. \"I heard, 'What about us?'\"\n[1963-07-27T10:55:00] Beach | I saw him mutter something. I heard, \"You have husbands.\" I thought about how, when he said the word \"husband,\" it was as if he were talking about a toad, a venomous snake, and a spider.\n[1963-07-27T11:00:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio stand up suddenly after hearing those words and start walking toward the seashore.\n[1963-07-27T11:05:00] Beach | I saw myself making an excuse for her. I heard, \"She's been a bit too sensitive lately. It's because of her [childbearing condition], she usually isn't like this.\"\n[1963-07-27T11:10:00] Beach | I saw Bruno speaking again in his patient tone. I heard, \"I'll go with her to buy a coconut.\"\n[1963-07-27T11:15:00] Beach | I saw our eyes following him as he walked steadily across the sand. He moved with ease, as if the scorching sand beneath his feet wasn't even there. I saw that he was small in stature but solid, with a broad chest and strong thighs.\n[1963-07-27T11:20:00] Beach | \"I saw Lina say as Bruno and Pinocchia walked toward the beach.\" I heard, \"Let's go swimming.\"\n[1963-07-27T11:30:00] Beach | I saw the three of us walking toward the sea, me in the middle, with the two of them on either side.\n[1963-07-27T11:35:00] Beach | I saw Nino say to me, \"We'll meet at seven o'clock tomorrow morning.\" I found it hard to describe my feelings at that moment, a sudden sense of victory.\n[1963-07-27T11:35:05] Beach | I thought, of course, I felt sorry for Pinocchio's fickle mood, but that sorrow was very slight and had no real impact on my cheerful mood.\n[1963-07-27T11:35:10] Beach | I thought about how I finally felt satisfied with myself, and a long, exciting weekend was waiting for me; at that moment, I felt proud to be there, being with the most important person in my life, someone who even my parents and my brothers and sisters couldn't compare to.\n[1963-07-27T11:40:00] Beach | I saw myself holding both of their hands and letting out a happy cry, pulling them into the cold, crashing sea water.\n[1963-07-27T11:41:00] Beach | I saw us, as one, plunge into the sea.",

I thought about how I've never liked the cold sea water wetting my hair, and the feeling of the seawater on my scalp and in my ears.\n[1963-07-27T11:43:00] Sea | I saw myself rising to the surface, shaking off the water.\n[1963-07-27T11:45:00] Sea | I saw them already swimming, so I started swimming too to keep up. I immediately realized it was a very difficult thing to do.\n[1963-07-27T11:46:00] Sea | I saw that I couldn't swim straight ahead. My head was underwater, and I could still calmly move my arms, but my right arm was stronger than my left, so I always drifted off course. Plus, I was also worried about swallowing water.\n[1963-07-27T11:50:00] Sea | I thought about how I tried to keep up with them. I was nearsighted, but I still hoped I could always see them. I thought they would stop.\n[1963-07-27T11:55:00] Sea | I saw my heart beating fast, then I slowed down until it finally stopped, floating on the water, watching them swim confidently one after another toward the distance.\n[1963-07-27T12:00:00] Sea | I saw that, perhaps, they had swum too far, and I had too. At the time, I had been seized by a sudden impulse, and I swam farther than my usual safe line. Normally, from that line, I could swim back to shore with just two strokes.\n[1963-07-27T12:05:00] Sea | I saw that Lina had never crossed that line either, but now she was competing with Nino. I knew that despite her lack of experience, she didn't back down, and she swam farther and farther away from him.\n[1963-07-27T12:10:00] Sea | I thought about it, worrying: What if she lost her strength? What if she felt unwell? Nino is a good swimmer; he would help Lina, but what if he cramp up? What if he couldn't hold on either?\n[1963-07-27T12:15:00] Sea | I looked around, the waves pushed me to the left. I couldn't wait here for them, I should go back to the shore.\n[1963-07-27T12:15:05] Sea | I looked down. The sky-blue had turned into a deep blue, and the color below grew darker and darker, like night, even though the sun was shining on the sea, which shimmered with glints of white, as if connected to the horizon. I thought that was really a mistake.\n[1963-07-27T12:15:10] Sea | I thought I felt a deep chasm beneath my feet, without any solid ground, like a death trap that could spring up at any moment, piercing me, catching me, tearing me apart, dragging me into the depths of the sea.\n[1963-07-27T12:20:00] Sea | I forced myself to calm down and shouted, \"Lina!\" I saw it, but I wasn't wearing my glasses, so I couldn't see anything. All I saw was a vast expanse of white sea.\n[1963-07-27T12:25:00] Sea | I was thinking about my outing with Nino the next day as I swam back slowly, floating on my back, moving my arms and legs, until I reached the shore.\n[1963-07-27T12:30:00] Beach | I saw myself sitting in the shallow water, straining to look at their dark heads far out on the sea, like two buoys. I felt a sense of relief.\n[1963-07-27T12:35:00] Beach | I saw that Lina was not only fine, but she had also caught up with Nino, swimming just as fast as he did. I thought how enthusiastic, exaggerated, and brave she was.\n[1963-07-27T12:40:00] Beach | I saw myself stand up and walk over to Bruno, who was sitting next to us. \"I heard 'Where's Pinocchio?' I asked.\"\n[1963-07-27T12:40:05] Beach | I saw him smile shyly. I heard, \"She's gone.\" I thought that he was trying to hide his sadness.\n[1963-07-27T12:40:10] Beach | I heard, \"Where did she go?\"  \n\"She went home. She said she wanted to pack her luggage.\"  \n\"Luggage?\"  \n\"She wants to leave here. She can't stay away from her husband for so long.\"\n[1963-07-27T12:50:00] Beach | I saw myself taking my things, and I made him watch Nino, especially watching Lina. I ran back all wet, wanting to see what was wrong with Pinocchio.\n[1963-07-27T14:00:00] Rentals | I knew it was a terrible afternoon, and the situation got even worse by nightfall. I saw Pinocchia really packing her suitcase, and Nunzia couldn't calm her down.\n[1963-07-27T14:10:00] Rentals | \"I don't want you to worry,\" Nunzia said calmly, \"Rino can wash his own underpants, he can cook, and his father is at home, plus other friends. He won't think you're here just for your own pleasure. He understands you're here to rest, to have a beautiful and healthy baby.\"\n[1963-07-27T14:15:00] Renting house | \"I heard, 'Come on! Let me help you put things away. I've never taken a vacation before, but now thanks to God, we have money. But we can't waste it. It's not a sin to enjoy ourselves, and your financial situation allows for it. Pinocchio, my daughter!\"\n[1963-07-27T14:20:00] Rentals | I heard, \"Rino has been working for a whole week, he's very tired now, and he's coming right away. Don't let him see you like this. You know him, he gets worried easily, and when he gets worried, he gets angry. And what happens when he gets angry?\"\n[1963-07-27T14:25:00] Rentals | I heard, \"You want to go back to him, he's already left, he'll be with you soon, now you've met, you should be happy together. Now you look like this, it'll make everyone unhappy. Do you think that's good?\"\n[1963-07-27T14:30:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia pleading with all her might, but Pinocchia wouldn't listen at all.\n[1963-07-27T14:40:00] Renting House | At that point, I also joined the effort to persuade her. Eventually, we took the items out of her luggage, she put them back in, and she kept shouting. When she finally calmed down, we started all over again.\n[1963-07-27T15:00:00] Renting House | I saw Lina come back later. She leaned against the door frame, frowning as she looked at us. A long wrinkle appeared on her forehead, and she just stood there, watching Pinocchio's confused state.\n[1963-07-27T15:05:00] Rentals | I saw her nod. \"I'm okay, right?\" I asked.  \n\"You're swimming so well now.\"  \nShe said nothing.\n[1963-07-27T15:10:00] Renting House | I know her sister-in-law once again was insisting on leaving, saying goodbye to this place, and regretting all the things she hadn't done, sighing for her husband Rino. She contradictory said she couldn't bear to leave the sea, the scent of the garden, and the beach. I thought about the expression on her face, which looked both happy and sad. It was clear that Pinocchio's stubborn mischief had finally become more than she could stand.\n[1963-07-27T15:15:00] Rentals | I saw that although Lina said nothing, she didn't utter her usual cruel and mocking words. Finally, she coldly spit out a single sentence. I heard, \"They're coming soon.\" I thought it wasn't about asking everyone to return to normal emotions, but more like announcing an urgent matter that threatened everyone.\n[1963-07-27T15:20:00] Rentals | At that moment, Pinocchia completely broke down. She threw herself onto the suitcase that had already been closed.\n[1963-07-27T15:30:00] Renting House | I saw Lina make a face, then went back to get herself ready. She didn't take long and came back, tying her black hair up. I saw her wearing a very tight red dress.\n[1963-07-27T16:00:00] Renting House | I saw her be the first to hear the sound of the \"Lametta\" motorcycle, stick her head out of the window, and greet someone with enthusiasm, then speak to Pinocchia in a tone full of contempt, very seriously. I heard, \"You'd better go wash your face and change out of that wet swimsuit.\"\n[1963-07-27T16:05:00] Rentals | I saw Pinocchia looking at her, but she showed no reaction. I thought about how the two girls quickly exchanged something between them, a secret projection of their emotions, tiny molecules emitted from the depths of their hearts that left them broken and wounded. It was the trembling within that long second.\n[1963-07-27T16:05:05] Renting House | I saw that I had captured it, I didn't understand exactly what it was, but they did, they understood each other, they shared an unspoken understanding. I thought that Pinocchia knew that Lina understood her situation, and she realized that Lina wanted to help her, even if it was laced with contempt, so she did what Lina told her to.",

When she opened it and saw a gold chain with a heart-shaped pendant, she let out a cry of joy.\n[1963-07-27T16:50:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw, of course, that Rino had also brought a small gift for Pinocchia, and Pinocchia did her best to act as excited as Lina. I thought of her, but she still couldn't hide her pain and vulnerability.\n[1963-07-27T16:55:00] Rentals | I saw Rino's affectionate gestures, his embraces, and the gifts, which made her hastily conceal her true feelings, restoring her to the image of a happy wife. I thought of it, but only for a brief moment.\n[1963-07-27T17:00:00] Rentals | I saw her lips begin to tremble, her tears gushed forth like a fountain, and she spoke in a voice choked with sobs. I heard, \"I've already packed my luggage. I don't want to stay here for another minute. I just want to be with you.\"\n[1963-07-27T17:05:00] Renting House | I saw Rino smiling, and this intense love moved him deeply. I heard him say, \"I just want to be with you.\"\n[1963-07-27T17:05:05] Rentals | I thought that in the end, he understood that his wife wasn't just telling him how much she missed him—she was saying she really wanted to leave, that she had already made up her mind, and she expressed her resolve to go through that unbearable crying.\n[1963-07-27T17:10:00] Rentals | I saw them close the door and start discussing, but their discussion was short.\n[1963-07-27T17:15:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw Rino come back to us, shouting at his mother. \"I heard, 'Mom, I want to know what happened.'\"\n[1963-07-27T17:15:05] Renting house | I saw that his mother hadn't answered yet, and he glared fiercely at his sister. I heard, \"If it was your fault, if it really was your fault, I'll break your face...\"\n[1963-07-27T17:15:10] Renting House | I saw and then he shouted something in his wife's direction. I heard, \"Enough! I've had enough, I'm fed up, get out here, I'm tired, I want to eat.\"\n[1963-07-27T17:20:00] Renting house | I saw Pinocchia come out with swollen eyes. After seeing her, Stefano made a joke to ease the mood, hugging his sister and sighing as he said. \"I heard, 'Ah, my dear little sister, you women really drive us crazy.'\"\n[1963-07-27T17:25:00] Renting House | I saw that, and it seemed he suddenly remembered his previous outburst; he kissed Lina's lips. I thought about seeing another couple so unhappy, and he felt very happy, because the two of them were now unexpectedly cheerful.\n[1963-07-27T18:00:00] Rentals | I saw everyone sitting at the table, and Nunzia silently served us rice.\n[1963-07-27T18:10:00] Rentals | I saw it, but this time Rino couldn't take it anymore. He shouted that he wasn't hungry anymore and threw the entire plate of clam noodles into the middle of the kitchen.\n[1963-07-27T18:15:00] Rentals | I saw something that made me feel very scared, and Pinocchio started crying.\n[1963-07-27T18:20:00] Renting House | I saw Stefano's tone also changed, becoming very impatient, he said to his wife. I heard, \"Let's go, I'll take you to a restaurant.\"\n[1963-07-27T18:25:00] Renting House | I saw them leave the kitchen amid Nunzia and Pinochia's protests. After a moment of silence, we heard the sound of the \"Lametta\" motorcycle starting up.\n[1963-07-27T19:00:00] Rentals | I saw myself helping Nunzia clean the floor, and Rino stood up and went back to his room.\n[1963-07-27T19:10:00] Rentals | I saw Pinocchio lock herself in the bathroom, but a little while later, she went back to the room and found her husband, then closed the door behind her.\n[1963-07-27T19:20:00] Rentals | I saw that at this moment, Nunzia started muttering, as if she had forgotten that she was a very obedient and good-tempered mother-in-law. \"I heard, 'Did you see that scumbag making Rino suffer! What's wrong with her?'\"\n[1963-07-27T19:25:00] Renting House | I told her I didn't know, and in fact I really didn't. All evening, I comforted her, rationalizing Pinocchio's emotions.\n[1963-07-27T19:30:00] Rentals | I heard myself say that if I were pregnant, I would also want to stay by my husband's side all the time, feeling protected and safe, taking on the responsibility of being a mother, while he took on the responsibility of being a father.\n[1963-07-27T19:35:00] Rentals | I heard myself say that if Lina had come here for [pregnancy status], it was obvious that the sanatorium was working, that the sea was having an effect on her. Just look at the expression of happiness on her face when Stefano arrived.\n[1963-07-27T19:40:00] Renting House | I heard that Pinocchio is already very spoiled, and she longs to be in love with Rino every minute of every day, otherwise her heart would feel restless and painful.\n[1963-07-27T20:00:00] Rentals | I saw that I and Nunzia had already cleaned the kitchen, and all the pots and pans were spotless. She said to me. I heard, \"Elena, you really know how to comfort people! You're sure to have a bright future.\" I saw that moment, and the atmosphere was very peaceful.\n[1963-07-27T20:05:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw tears welling up in her eyes as she muttered, Lina should have gone to school, that was her fate. \"I heard her say, 'But my husband didn't want her to go to school,' and then she continued, 'I couldn't do anything about it. At that time, we didn't have any money, otherwise she would have been like you. But she got married, took another path, and there was no turning back. We're all at the mercy of life...\"\n[1963-07-27T20:10:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw her wish me happiness. I heard her say, \"You're looking for a boy like you, who has been to school.\" She asked me if I really liked Nino's son.\n[1963-07-27T20:15:00] Rentals | I denied it, but I told her that the next day I was going hiking with Nino. She was very happy and made me some sandwiches with sausage and cheese.\n[1963-07-27T20:20:00] Renting House | I saw myself wrapping the sandwiches in paper, putting them in a bag, and placing them together with the towel I used for the beach and other things.\n[1963-07-27T20:25:00] Rentals | I saw her tell me to be careful when I left, and then we said goodnight to each other.\n[1963-07-27T21:00:00] Renting House | I saw myself returning to my small room, closing the door and starting to read, but it was hard to concentrate. I thought to myself that going out early the next day would be very comfortable, with fresh and fragrant air.\n[1963-07-27T21:05:00] Rentals | I thought about how I liked the sea, even Pinocchio and her crying and quarrels, and the reconciliation between Lina and Stefano, their feelings growing stronger every week.\n[1963-07-27T21:10:00] Renting House | I thought about how much I longed for Nino! I wished that every day he could be by my side, with my friends, how happy it would be, although they didn't understand each other, although sometimes we couldn't hide some bad feelings deep within our hearts.\n[1963-07-27T23:00:00] Rentals | I saw Stefano and Lina returning. I heard the door open and close, heard them speaking in hushed voices, and heard the sound of water running from the tap.\n[1963-07-27T23:30:00] Renting House | I saw myself turn off the light, and finally, I fell asleep. I heard the rustling of reeds outside the window and the commotion in the chicken coop.\n[1963-07-28 10:00:00] Barano | I waited for Lina to write back to me, we had agreed to keep in touch, but she never replied.\n[1963-07-28T02:00:00] Renting House | I saw it, but I immediately woke up—someone was in my room! \"I'm the one,\" Lina said in a low voice.\n[1963-07-28T02:00:05] Renting House | I saw her sit on the edge of my bed, and I wanted to turn on the light. I heard, \"Don't turn on the light.\" She said, \"I'll stay for just a little while.\"",

Her skin was sunburned, making her white eyes stand out even more.\n[1963-07-28T02:00:20] Rentals | I heard, \"Did you see how far I swam today?\"  \n\"You did great, but you worried me today.\"\n[1963-07-28T02:00:25] Rentals | I saw her shake her head very proudly, then smile, and suddenly, she became very serious. I thought as if she had already become completely at ease in the sea.\n[1963-07-28T02:00:30] Rentals | I saw her speak all that had happened in one breath, like a penitent, even trying to hide some things from herself that she could not bring herself to confess. I heard, \"I have something to tell you.\"\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Nino [intimate act] me,\" she said. \"He [intimate act] me, but I kept my lips tightly closed.\"\n[1963-07-28T02:10:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw her telling me in great detail—she had swum for a long time, was completely exhausted, but she was happy to have proven how capable she was. She leaned on Nino to save some strength, floating on the water.\n[1963-07-28T02:10:05] Rentals | I saw how Nino took advantage of her closeness, pressing his lips firmly against hers. She immediately closed her mouth, and he tried to use his tongue to open it, but he never managed to.\n[1963-07-28T02:10:10] Rentals | I saw her push Nino and say. I heard him say, \"Are you crazy? I'm already married.\"  \nNino's answer was, \"I fell in love with you earlier than your husband, way back during our class competition, I fell in love with you.\"\n[1963-07-28T02:10:15] Renting House | I saw Lina tell him never to do that again, and then they swam toward the shore, she said finally. I heard, \"He was so forceful, he hurt my lips, and they still hurt now.\"\n[1963-07-28T02:10:20] Rentals | I saw her waiting for my reaction, but I controlled myself, not asking any questions or making any comments.\n[1963-07-28T02:10:25] Renting House | I saw her advise me not to go climbing with him the next day unless Bruno also went.\n[1963-07-28T02:10:30] Renting House | I told her coldly that if Nino had [intimate act] with me, I wouldn't have any problem, because I wasn't married and didn't have a boyfriend, I added. I heard her say, \"The only regret is that I don't like him. If he were to [intimate act] me, my feeling would be like [intimate act] a dead mouse.\"\n[1963-07-28T02:10:35] Renting House | I saw that, so I pretended I couldn't help but yawn. She looked at me, then went to sleep. I thought about how I felt that her gaze contained warmth and admiration.\n[1963-07-28T03:00:00] Renting House | I cried all the time from the moment she left the room until the next dawn.\n[1963-07-28T03:30:00] Renting House | I think that by now, whenever I recall the pain I felt back then, I don't understand the person I was at all. But that night, I felt like I had no reason to go on living.\n[1963-07-28T03:35:00] Renting House | I wondered why Nino was the way he was. He kissed Nadia, he kissed me, and he even kissed Lina. How could he be the person I loved, the serious, thoughtful person I thought he was?\n[1963-07-28T03:40:00] Renting House | I thought about it several hours later, but I still couldn't accept the fact: he was profound when dealing with big issues in the world, yet so superficial when it came to personal feelings.\n[1963-07-28T03:45:00] Renting House | I thought about how I began to think about myself, and I suddenly felt enlightened. Like this short, plump girl, wearing glasses, who studied hard but wasn't smart, pretending to be cultured, knowing a lot, but actually wasn't. Even though it was just a vacation, how could I possibly expect him to like me?\n[1963-07-28T03:50:00] Renting House | I wondered if, besides that, I had ever really thought about him. I carefully analyzed my actions. No, I couldn't clearly express my desires.\n[1963-07-28T03:55:00] Rentals | I thought about how I not only concealed my feelings in front of others, but also faced myself with deep uncertainty, without any real certainty.\n[1963-07-28T04:00:00] Rentals | Why hadn't I ever clearly told Lina how I felt about Nino? After she told me that thing at night, why hadn't I shouted out the pain this had stirred up inside me? Why hadn't I told her that Nino had also kissed me before he kissed her?\n[1963-07-28T04:05:00] Rentals | What made me act that way? I controlled my deep emotions, because I was afraid of my crazy longing for things, people, praise, and success deep inside me?\n[1963-07-28T04:10:00] Renting House | I thought about the crazy longing that would erupt inside me when my desires weren't fulfilled, leading to even worse feelings—like the one that made me compare Nino's beautiful mouth to a dead mouse?\n[1963-07-28T04:15:00] Rentals | I thought, even though I've always been pushing myself forward, in reality I've always been ready to retreat? Why do I always put on a sweet smile and laugh happily when things don't go my way? Why do I inevitably find justifications for those who have made me suffer?\n[1963-07-28T05:00:00] Rentals | I saw myself asking these questions while crying, and the day had already broken. I thought I had figured out what had happened.\n[1963-07-28T05:05:00] Renting House | I thought that Nino truly believed he had fallen in love with Nadia; Teacher Galiani praised me, and over these years, Nino too had looked at me with admiration and affection.\n[1963-07-28T05:10:00] Renting House | I thought about it, but now, in Vomero, he met Lina, and he understood that since his childhood—perhaps forever—Lina had always been his only true love.\n[1963-07-28T05:15:00] Apartment for Rent | I thought so, this is the truth of the matter. How could I blame him for it? Where was his fault? In their story, there was something intense, exalted, and selectively affectionate.\n[1963-07-28T05:20:00] Rentals | I thought of some lines from poems and novels, trying to calm myself down. Maybe the use of going to school for me was just this: to teach me how to calm down.\n[1963-07-28T05:25:00] Rentals | I thought about how Lina had ignited a flame in Nino's heart, a flame that had burned within him for many years, though he had never been aware of it. Now, the flame was burning again.\n[1963-07-28T05:30:00] Rentals | What other choice did he have but to love Lina? Even though Lina didn't love him, even though she was already married and could not come near, could not possess: marriage was eternal, until death, unless at the final judgment, when in the blizzard of hell this marriage would dissolve.\n[1963-07-28T05:35:00] Renting House | I saw when dawn arrived. I thought I had everything figured out, that Nino's love for Lina was impossible, just like my love for him.\n[1963-07-28T05:40:00] Rentals | I thought that only in this impossible situation, in the middle of the sea, Nino's [intimate act] toward Lina made sense, that [intimate act].\n[1963-07-28T05:45:00] Renting House | I realized this wasn't a choice—it just happened: especially because Lina knew how to make things happen, and I couldn't. What am I going to do now?\n[1963-07-28T05:50:00] Apartment for Rent | I thought about going to the meeting, would we climb Mount Etna? Or wouldn't we? Tonight I'm going back to San Gregorio Armeno with Stefano and Rino, I'll say my mother wrote to me, she needs me to go back and help?\n[1963-07-28T05:55:00] Renting House | I know Nino loves Lina, he [intimate act] with Lina, how can I still go hiking with him? How can I watch them every day, swimming further and further away in the sea?\n[1963-07-28T06:00:00] Renting House | I felt so exhausted that I fell asleep.\n[1963-07-28T06:30:00] Rentals | I saw myself suddenly waking up and rushing off to the meeting. I thought my analysis worked, I really controlled the pain.",

I thought about it, but the weather was so hot. He predicted we would definitely be very tired, and there wouldn't necessarily be anything more comfortable than swimming in the sea.\n[1963-07-28T07:10:00] Chitala Beach | I saw him say he was going to rent a small boat. I didn't expect him to say he was going to rent a small boat.

He smiled and politely said to me. I heard, \"You've made a sandwich, I'll rent the boat.\"\n[1963-07-28T07:30:00] Sea | I saw that after a few minutes, we were already on the sea, he was rowing and I was sitting at the back of the boat. I thought I felt a bit better, I thought maybe Lina was lying, that Nino had never actually [done that] with her.\n[1963-07-28T07:35:00] Sea | I thought about it, but a voice inside me said, \"No, it's not like that!\" I am the kind of person who sometimes lies, and especially lies to myself; but she wasn't like that. In my memory, she never lied at all.\n[1963-07-28T07:40:00] Sea | I thought I just needed to wait, not for too long, and Nino would eventually explain everything to me.\n[1963-07-28T08:00:00] Sea | I saw that we had reached the center of the sea. He lowered the oar and jumped into the water, and I followed him in.\n[1963-07-28T08:10:00] Sea | I saw him dive into the deep sea, disappearing, then soon reappearing not far away, and diving down again. I saw that he didn't swim as far as usual, disappearing into the gentle undulations of the sea.\n[1963-07-28T08:20:00] Sea | I saw them only daring to swim around the boat in the near distance, not venturing too far away. Later, I got tired and clumsily climbed aboard the boat. I thought I wasn't very familiar with the deep sea, and I was a little scared.\n[1963-07-28T08:30:00] Sea | I saw that after a while, he returned to the boat and sat by the oars, beginning to row strongly, along the shore, toward Emperor's Point.\n[1963-07-28T09:00:00] On the boat | I heard them saying they were glad they hadn't had to go to Emporio. I thought that up until that point, we had only talked about sandwiches, the hot weather, and the sea.\n[1963-07-28T09:10:00] On the boat | I saw that even though sometimes I worried about an awkward silence, I would bring up some topics as a way to spark his interest in the world, but he didn't want to talk about them. I thought it was surprising that he hadn't mentioned the questions he had seen in books, magazines, and newspapers, because he was thinking about something else.\n[1963-07-28T09:15:00] On the boat | I saw him later set down the oar, stare at the stone wall for a while, and watch the gulls flying in the sky, then he asked me. \"I heard 'Lina didn't tell you anything, did she?'\"  \n\"Tell me what?\"\n[1963-07-28T09:15:05] On the boat | I saw him press his lips together, and he spoke uncomfortably. I heard, \"Okay, I'll tell you what happened: yesterday I had sex with her.\"\n[1963-07-28T10:00:00] On the boat | I saw that later that day, he kept talking about the two of them. I knew the opening line would be this.\n[1963-07-28T11:00:00] On the boat | I saw us swimming again, we went to explore the rocks and caves, we ate sandwiches and drank the water I brought. He wanted to teach me how to row, but the things we talked about were still about the two of them.\n[1963-07-28T11:30:00] On the boat | I saw that he only talked about him and Lina, Lina and him. He didn't talk about love, he didn't say why he loved this person instead of another. What struck me most was that he never turned his personal issues into universal ones, as he usually did.\n[1963-07-28T11:35:00] On the boat | I saw him constantly asking me about her and her relationship with Stefano. I heard, \"Why did she marry him?\"  \n\"Because she loved him.\"  \n\"That's impossible.\"\n[1963-07-28T11:35:05] On the boat | I heard, \"I can assure you, that's how it was.\"  \n\"She married him for money, to help her family and to secure herself.\"  \n\"If it was about money, she could have married Marcello instead.\"\n[1963-07-28T11:35:10] On the boat | I heard, \"Who is he?\"  \n\"A richer man than Stefano, who did a lot of crazy things to get her.\"  \n\"What about her?\"  \n\"She doesn't want to be with him.\"\n[1963-07-28T11:35:15] On the boat | \"I heard, 'So you think she married that sausage seller because of love?'  \n'Yes.'  \n'She went swimming to [pregnancy condition]? What's that all about?'  \n'It's what the doctor said.'\"\n[1963-07-28T11:35:20] On the boat | I heard, \"Does she want [pregnancy]?\"  \n\"At first, she didn't want it, but now I don't know.\"  \n\"Then does he want it?\"  \n\"He really wants it.\"\n[1963-07-28T11:35:25] On the boat | I heard, \"Does he love Lina?\"  \n\"Yes, very much.\"  \n\"What about you? As an outsider, what do you think about them?\"  \n\"Lina has problems with anyone.\"\n[1963-07-28T11:35:30] On the boat | \"I heard 'that is to say?'\"\n\"They had problems on the first day of their marriage, but it was Lina's fault. She didn't know how to adapt to her new identity.\"\n\"What about now?\"\n\"It's a bit better now.\"\n\"I don't believe it.\"\n[1963-07-28T11:40:00] On the boat | As I spoke, his expression grew more and more doubtful, but I stood by my conviction: Lina had never loved her husband as much as she did during that time.\n[1963-07-28T11:45:00] On the boat | The more I insisted on saying that, the less he believed me. I spoke in a very clear tone, saying that nothing would happen between them, and I didn't want him to have any illusions.\n[1963-07-28T13:00:00] On the boat | I thought, but the conversation wasn't over. The more I detailed my account of Lina, the more obvious it became to me that the day spent between the sky and the sea was increasingly enjoyable for him.\n[1963-07-28T13:30:00] On the boat | I thought he didn't care if every word I spoke hurt him. He wanted me to tell him everything I knew, good or bad. He wanted every hour, every minute we spent together to be filled with her name.\n[1963-07-28T14:00:00] On the boat | I saw myself constantly saying Lina. At first, it was painful, but over time, things began to change.\n[1963-07-28T14:30:00] On the boat | I thought, I felt, that day when I talked to Nino about Lina, this might be a new way for the three of us to get along in the coming weeks.\n[1963-07-28T15:00:00] On the boat | I thought neither of us would ever have Nino, but both of us would receive his attention throughout the holiday. She would be the object of his hopeless love, and I would be the wise counselor, stopping him from acting out with her.\n[1963-07-28T15:30:00] On the boat | I felt a slight sense of comfort at the thought of this possible central position; Lina came to tell me that Nino had [intimate act] her. As for him, driven by that [intimate act], he wanted to tell me what had happened, which kept him with me all day long, making me an indispensable person for both of them.\n[1963-07-28T16:00:00] On the boat | I heard, \"Do you think she might like me?\" Later he asked me. I thought that, in reality, Nino had already become unable to live without me.\n[1963-07-28T16:05:00] On the boat | I heard, \"She's made her decision, Nino.\"  \n\"What decision?\"  \n\"She's decided to love her husband and have a child with him. That's why she came here.\"\n[1963-07-28T16:10:00] On the boat | I heard, \"What about my love for her?\"  \n\"After you've loved her once and then fallen in love with her again, she might feel grateful. But if you don't want to suffer, you can't expect anything.\"\n[1963-07-28T16:15:00] On the boat | I heard her say, \"Lina, the more you invest your feelings in her, the more you admire her, the crueler she becomes. She's always been like that.\"",

How could I possibly endure that pain?\n[1963-07-28T19:25:00] On the way home | I thought about how I had talked to Nino about Lina, and how Lina had talked to me about Nino. From tomorrow on, I would witness their discussions, games, embraces, and touches.\n[1963-07-28T19:30:00] On the way home | I thought about it, and after I decided to go home, I would tell them that my mother had sent me back to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1963-07-28T19:40:00] Rentals | I saw her, but as I had just entered, Lina spoke to me very seriously. I heard, \"Where did you go? We all looked for you. We need you, you have to help us.\"\n[1963-07-28T20:00:00] Rentals | I know that later, I found out that they had a terrible day because of Pinocchia, who had troubled everyone.\n[1963-07-28T20:30:00] Renting House | I saw it all, and she started shouting that if her husband didn't let her go home, he didn't love her, and she was willing to die with the children. Rino had no choice but to take her back to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1963-07-29 14:00:00] Barano | I saw myself practicing English with the English people who were staying at Nella's house. They started talking to me because they noticed I wanted to learn English, and they were very friendly. I made rapid progress.\n[1963-07-29 15:00:00] Barano | I saw that Nella was always happy, she encouraged me, and I began to work as her interpreter.\n[1963-07-29 16:00:00] Barano | I saw her saying many kind things to me, making me hearty meals, and she was an excellent cook.\n[1963-07-29T10:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw Monday, and Nino appeared, like a ghost summoned by my wish. I thought about how he had appeared at ten in the morning, instead of his usual four in the afternoon, which was a big surprise for us.\n[1963-07-29T10:05:00] Chitala Beach | I thought about when we first arrived at the beach, everyone was full of resentment, thinking that someone had taken too long in the restroom.\n[1963-07-29T10:05:05] Chitala Beach | I felt especially anxious about Pinocchio, because she messed up her hair when she slept.\n[1963-07-29T10:10:00] Chitara Beach | I hadn't yet explained why he hadn't come at his usual time today, and Pinocchia spoke up first. She was somewhat fierce, even menacingly demanding of Nino. I heard, \"Why didn't Bruno come? Does he have something more interesting to do?\"\n[1963-07-29T10:10:05] Chitala Beach | I heard, \"His parents are home, they're leaving at noon.\"  \n\"Will he come after his parents leave?\"  \n\"Probably.\"\n[1963-07-29T10:10:10] Chitala Beach | I heard, \"If he doesn't come, I'll go back to sleep. Being with the three of you is so annoying I could scream.\"\n[1963-07-29T10:15:00] Chitala Beach | I saw Nino telling us how terrible his weekend in Barano had been. I knew it was already early morning, but he couldn't go directly to Bruno's house; instead, he came straight to the beach.\n[1963-07-29T10:20:00] Chitala Beach | When I saw Nino speaking, Pinocchia interrupted him two or three times, asking us with a resentful expression. I heard who could go swimming with her.\n[1963-07-29T10:25:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that neither I nor Lina paid any attention to her, so she angrily went underwater by herself.\n[1963-07-29T10:30:00] Chitala Beach | I saw, let her go! We were more willing to listen to Nino list all his father's faults.\n[1963-07-29T10:35:00] Chitala Beach | I saw him say that his father was a lazy man who had applied for an extension of his vacation, claiming he had some illness, and had a doctor friend working in the medical system issue him a certificate. I heard \"He's a cheat.\" That was Nino's definition of his father.\n[1963-07-29T10:35:05] Chitala Beach | I saw him say it with hatred. I heard, \"My father is a complete selfish man.\"\n[1963-07-29T10:35:10] Chitala Beach | I saw that, without any warning, he [intimate gesture] my cheek with a very loud, passionate [intimate gesture], then he immediately said, \"I'm so glad to see you.\" I thought of it and was so startled I almost jumped up.\n[1963-07-29T10:35:15] Chitala Beach | I saw and then he felt a bit embarrassed, he said. I heard, \"Can I also [intimate act] you for a moment?\" I thought, as if he had just realized that his bold display in front of me might have offended Lina.\n[1963-07-29T10:35:20] Chitala Beach | I saw him gently [intimate gesture] Lina, making no sound, just lightly touching her lips with his. I heard \"Of course.\" Lina answered.\n[1963-07-29T10:40:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that after that, he began to speak about Beckett's plays in an extremely excited tone: Ah! How much he loved those people buried in the ground, their heads only sticking out; how beautiful was that line \"a flame is kindled in your heart at this moment.\"\n[1963-07-29T10:40:05] Chitala Beach | I saw Mandy and Dan Rooney saying many brilliant things, but he had a hard time finding the line Lina mentioned—that well, the idea that a person who is blind, deaf, mute, even without taste or touch, can more truly feel life, is itself very interesting.\n[1963-07-29T10:40:10] Chitara Beach | I saw, according to his explanation, that the author meant: we need to remove all the filters that prevent us from living in the present moment, in order to fully experience real life.\n[1963-07-29T10:45:00] Chitara Beach | I saw Lina acting very uneasy. She said she had imagined it, and the idea of a \"pure state of life\" frightened her. I heard her exclaim dramatically, \"A life that cannot see, cannot speak, cannot express, cannot listen—without any attachment, any container—is a distorted life.\"\n[1963-07-29T10:45:05] Chitala Beach | I don't remember her exact words, but I'm certain that when she said the word \"transformation,\" she made a very annoyed gesture.\n[1963-07-29T10:50:00] Chitala Beach | I saw Nino muttering the word—\"transformation\"—again and again, as if it were a curse.\n[1963-07-29T10:55:00] Chitara Beach | I saw him analyzing again later, more excited than before. Eventually, he suddenly took off his sweat-soaked shirt, grabbed our hands, and pulled us into the water. I saw his bony, dark body exposed.\n[1963-07-29T10:56:00] Sea | I cried out happily at that moment, and Lina was laughing. I heard, \"No, no, don't, I'm cold, don't do this.\"  \nHe replied, \"We've finally had an extraordinary day.\"\n[1963-07-29T11:00:00] Sea | I thought to myself at that moment, perhaps Lina was wrong. There really was another Nino: not the gloomy boy—the one who was always thinking about the fate of the whole world, the whole human race—but this boy right here.\n[1963-07-29T11:00:05] At sea | I thought of a boy who would play, who would drag us under; a boy who would grab us, push us, pull us toward him; a boy who would swim away, making us chase him, make us catch him, and pretend to drown him underwater.\n[1963-07-29T12:00:00] Chitala Beach | After Bruno arrived, the atmosphere improved.\n[1963-07-29T12:30:00] Chitara Beach | I saw us walking together, and gradually Pinocchio's mood improved. She wanted to go swimming in the sea, she wanted to eat a coconut.\n[1963-07-29T21:00:00] Renting House | I knew the next day that Pinocchio had left. I thought it was a good thing that she wasn't there in the evening—no crying, no arguing, the house was quiet, and time passed silently.\n[1963-07-29T21:30:00] Rentals | I saw that when I returned to my small room, Lina followed me, and our conversation was superficial. I thought about expressing my thoughts, but I was careful not to reveal my true feelings.\n[1963-07-29T21:35:00] Rentals | \"I heard her say, 'Do you know why she wants to leave?'\" Lina asked me, referring to Pinocchia.  \n\"Because she wants to be with her husband.\"\n[1963-07-29T21:35:05] Renting House | I saw her shaking her head and said seriously. I heard, \"She was scared by her own feelings.\"  \n\"What does that mean?\"  \n\"She fell in love with Bruno.\"\n[1963-07-29T21:35:10] Rentals | I heard, \"You mean Pinocchio?\"  \n\"Yes.\" I thought to myself, I was amazed, I had never even considered such a possibility.\n[1963-07-29T21:35:15] Rentals | I heard, \"What about Bruno?\"  \n\"He didn't even notice.\"  \n\"Are you sure?\"  \n\"Yes.\"",

I thought to myself that I seemed to be floating on the bedsheet.\n[1963-07-29T23:00:00] Rentals | I wondered if Pinocchia left in such a hurry because she had fallen in love with Bruno. But Bruno didn't want her—he wanted me?\n[1963-07-29T23:10:00] Apartment for Rent | I found myself thinking about the relationship between Pinocchio and Bruno, recalling everything she had said, her tone, her gestures, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt that Lina was right.\n[1963-07-29T23:15:00] Rentals | I found myself suddenly developing a liking for Stefano's sister, because she had the courage to strongly demand to leave.\n[1963-07-29T23:20:00] Renting House | I thought about the fact that Bruno liked me, but I didn't believe it. He had never even looked at me once. Besides, if, as Lina said, his target was me, he should have come himself instead of sending Nino, or at least they could have come together.\n[1963-07-29T23:25:00] Renting House | I thought, no matter what, whether true or not, I don't like him. He's too short, his hair is too curly, he has no forehead, and his teeth are too sharp. No, no, I thought, I won't be ambiguous, I'll be clear.\n[1963-07-30T10:00:00] Beach | I saw that the next morning at ten o'clock, we arrived at the beach, and the two boys were already there. I saw them walking back and forth along the beach.\n[1963-07-30T10:05:00] Beach | I saw Lina briefly explain why Pinocchia hadn't come: she had to work, and she had gone back with her husband.\n[1963-07-30T10:10:00] Beach | I saw that neither Nino nor Bruno showed the slightest regret. I thought about it and it made me feel uneasy.\n[1963-07-30T10:15:00] Beach | I know that Pinocchio stayed with us for two weeks, the five of us taking walks, chatting, joking, and swimming together. I wondered how she could just disappear without a sound, leaving no trace at all?\n[1963-07-30T10:20:00] Beach | I thought that during those fifteen days, something would happen that she would remember for the rest of her life, something she would never forget—the first vacation of her life.\n[1963-07-30T10:25:00] Beach | I wonder, what about us? We both paid attention to her in our own ways. I thought, but in reality, she was gone, and we didn't feel the slightest lack of her.\n[1963-07-30T10:30:00] Beach | I saw, for example, that Nino didn't say a word about her sudden departure. I heard Bruno say simply, \"It's a pity, we didn't even say hello.\"\n[1963-07-30T10:31:00] Beach | I saw that a minute later we were already talking about something else. I thought that she had never come to Vomero, had never appeared on the Chiara beach.\n[1963-07-30T10:40:00] Beach | I know that Nino usually speaks to me and Lina, or more often just to me. I thought I didn't like the idea of switching roles so quickly.\n[1963-07-30T10:45:00] Beach | I saw that now he only spoke to Lina. I thought, as if we were now four people, he no longer had to take the responsibility of talking to me.\n[1963-07-30T10:50:00] Beach | I saw Bruno; he had been taking care of Pinocchia until last Saturday, and now he turned to me, still in that shy and considerate way. I thought that, for him, there was no difference between me and Pinocchia, even though she was a married woman with children and I wasn't.\n[1963-07-30T11:00:00] Beach | I saw our first walk along the coast, which began with the four of us walking side by side, but soon Bruno spotted a shell washed up by a wave and bent down to pick it up. I heard him say, \"Very beautiful.\"\n[1963-07-30T11:05:00] Beach | I saw him, and out of courtesy I stopped to wait for him, and he gave me the shell. I thought that it was an ordinary shell, nothing special at all.\n[1963-07-30T11:10:00] Beach | I saw that at this point, Nino and Lina didn't stop, but kept walking forward, and soon it became that the two couples were walking on the beach, the two of them ahead and the two of us behind.\n[1963-07-30T11:15:00] Beach | I saw they were talking intensely, so I tried to make small talk with Bruno, but Bruno responded with great effort.\n[1963-07-30T11:20:00] Beach | I saw myself trying to quicken my pace, but he was reluctant to follow behind.\n[1963-07-30T11:25:00] Beach | I saw that I remembered him talking about the sea, the sky, and the gulls, but it was clear he was playing a role, a role he thought was suitable for me. I thought about how difficult it was for me to establish a real connection with him; he always spoke in general terms.\n[1963-07-30T11:30:00] Beach | I thought that when he was with Pinocchio, he must have talked about other things, otherwise it would be hard to understand how they could have enjoyed themselves so much for such a long time.\n[1963-07-30T11:35:00] Beach | I thought that, even if he was talking about something interesting, I still found it hard to figure out what he was saying.\n[1963-07-30T11:40:00] Beach | I know that if it's about asking for time, a cigarette or a little water would be needed; his voice was loud and his pronunciation clear. I thought that when he started playing the role of the suitor (\"This shell, you like it, look how beautiful, I'll give it to you\"), he would stammer. What he said wasn't Italian or the local dialect, but some very awkward language, his voice low and hesitant, as if he were ashamed of what he was saying.\n[1963-07-30T11:45:00] Beach | I saw myself nodding, while I listened in on what Nino and Lina were saying. I thought of it but I didn't know what he was talking about.\n[1963-07-30T11:50:00] Beach | I thought about how he would be talking about the serious issues he was studying, or how she would be showing off the ideas she had read in books—ideas that were actually taken from the books I had.\n[1963-07-30T11:55:00] Beach | I saw myself often trying to join their conversation, trying to regain my voice, but every time I approached them, the sentences I overheard left me confused.\n[1963-07-30T12:00:00] Beach | I thought I felt it— he was talking to Lina about his childhood at our Mergellina, his tone very intense, even exaggerated, and she listened quietly without interrupting him.\n[1963-07-30T12:05:00] Beach | I saw that I had lost my territory and could only stay behind, passing the time with Bruno. I thought I felt very uncomfortable.\n[1963-07-30T12:30:00] Beach | I saw that we had decided to swim together, and I didn't have the chance to slip between them as I had before.\n[1963-07-30T12:35:00] Beach | I saw Bruno say nothing, just pushed me into the water, getting my hair wet. I thought about it, and it really annoyed me.\n[1963-07-30T12:40:00] Beach | I saw that when I surfaced from the water, Nino and Lina had already swum a few meters ahead of me. They were floating on the water, chatting seriously.\n[1963-07-30T12:50:00] Beach | I saw that they stayed in the water longer than us, but they never strayed far from the shore. I thought they must have been so absorbed in their conversation that they even gave up their love of long-distance swimming.\n[1963-07-30T14:00:00] Beach | I saw him in the afternoon, and Nino spoke to me for the first time. He spoke very hurriedly, as if he himself knew he would be rejected. I heard, \"Shall we meet after dinner? We'll pick you up and then take you back.\"\n[1963-07-30T14:05:00] Beach | I gave Lina a questioning look, but her eyes were fixed on something else. I thought they had never invited us out in the evening.\n[1963-07-30T14:05:05] Beach | I saw what I said. I heard, \"Lina's mother is at home; we can't always leave her alone.\"\n[1963-07-30T14:05:10] Beach | I saw that Nino didn't respond, and Bruno said nothing either. But after we finished swimming, before we parted ways, Lina said. I heard, \"Tomorrow night we're going to Mergellina. I need to call my husband. We can have ice cream together.\"\n[1963-07-30T14:10:00] Beach | I was annoyed by her suggestion, and what made me even more angry was what happened afterward.\n[1963-07-30T14:15:00] Beach | I saw two guys heading towards Mergellina, and she started scolding me as she was packing up her things. I thought about it as if it had been an entire day, hour after hour, little thing after little thing, until Nino's request, and until my completely different answer from hers, which proved that I was unreasonable and unpredictable.\n[1963-07-30T14:20:00] Beach | I heard, \"Why have you always been with Bruno?\"  \n\"Me?\"  \n\"Yes, you. You'll never let me be alone with that man again.\"\n[1963-07-30T14:20:05] Beach | I heard, \"What are you talking about? You always walked ahead without ever waiting for us.\"  \n\"We? It was Nino who was walking really fast.\"  \n\"You could at least say that you should wait for me.\"\n[1963-07-30T14:20:10] Beach | \"I heard: 'You should tell Bruno to hurry up, otherwise you'll be left behind. Please! Look how much he likes you, you two can go out by yourselves in the evening. Say whatever you want, do whatever you want.'\"\n\"I'm here for you, not for Bruno.\"\n[1963-07-30T14:20:15] Beach | I heard, \"I don't think you're here for me. You always do whatever you want.\"  \n\"If you can't stand me anymore, I'll leave tomorrow morning.\"  \n\"Is that so? Then tonight I should go have ice cream with the two of them alone?\"\n[1963-07-30T14:20:20] Beach | \"I heard, 'Lina, it was you who said you wanted to have ice cream with them.'\"  \n\"I had to say that—I need to call Stefano. If they run into us at Mergellina, how are we going to explain it?\"\n[1963-07-30T19:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw us staying on the beach until the sun set. I heard them say, \"We should go, otherwise Nunzia will get angry.\" They also said they had to go back and study for a while.\n[1963-07-30T20:00:00] Rentals | I saw that at home, we still spoke in that same way, after dinner, right in front of Nunzia. I realized it wasn't a real argument, but a test—an attempt to communicate something we didn't understand.\n[1963-07-30T20:30:00] Renting House | I saw Nunzia listening to our conversation with some unease, and later she said. I heard, \"After dinner tomorrow, I'll go get ice cream with you all too.\"\n[1963-07-30T20:30:05] Renting House | I saw but Lina immediately interrupted. \"I heard 'The road is long.'\" I said.  \n\"We don't have to walk. We'll hire a motor tricycle. We're rich people.\"\n[1963-07-31T09:00:00] Beach | I saw that the next morning, in order to adjust to the two boys' new schedule, we didn't go to the beach at ten o'clock, but at nine, but they weren't there.\n[1963-07-31T10:00:00] Beach | I saw Lina getting increasingly restless. We waited and waited, but they didn't show up until ten o'clock, and they never appeared after that.\n[1963-07-31T15:00:00] Beach | I didn't see them until they appeared in the afternoon. I saw a look on her face that was knowingly sly and a bit impudent.\n[1963-07-31T15:05:00] Beach | I saw them say that since they would be with us in the evening, they had decided to study ahead of time.\n[1963-07-31T15:10:00] Beach | I saw her drive them away! I was surprised by Lina's reaction.\n[1963-07-31T15:10:05] Beach | I saw her speaking in a very rough dialect, word by word, saying that they could study whenever they wanted—afternoon, evening, night, right away, no one would stop them.\n[1963-07-31T15:15:00] Beach | I saw Nino and Bruno pretending she was joking, and they continued to smile.\n[1963-07-31T15:15:05] Beach | I saw her put on the sun dress, and impulsively grabbed my handbag, striding quickly down the main road.\n[1963-07-31T15:20:00] Beach | I saw Nino run after her right away, but he came back not long after. I saw a face full of despair.\n[1963-07-31T15:25:00] Beach | I thought there was no way around it—she was really angry, and didn't want to hear any explanation at all.\n[1963-07-31T15:30:00] Beach | I saw myself pretending to be calm as I said, \"I'm swimming with them.\" I heard \"It will pass.\"",

    "text": "[1963-07-31T15:35:00] Chitara Beach | I know, for example: Bruno wants to kiss Lina's feet covered in sand, Nino wants to kiss my hands, cheeks, forehead, ears, or punch the back of my ears.\n[1963-07-31T16:00:00] Beach | I saw myself drying off in the sun, eating a sandwich, chatting weakly with them, and then I said I was going back.\n[1963-07-31T16:05:00] Beach | \"I heard 'What about tonight?'\" Bruno asked.  \n\"Lina is going to call Stefano, and we're going to town.\"\n[1963-07-31T16:10:00] Beach | I couldn't stop thinking about the way Lina had thrown a tantrum, which really upset me. What did her tone, her behavior mean? They had just been late for the meeting. What right did she have to be angry?\n[1963-07-31T16:15:00] Beach | I wondered why she couldn't control herself, treating these two young men the same way she treated Pasquale or Antonio, even the Solara brothers? Why did she act like a very spoiled little girl instead of Madame Carracci?\n[1963-07-31T17:00:00] Renting House | I saw myself panting as I returned home, and Nunzia was washing towels and swimsuits.\n[1963-07-31T17:05:00] Renting House | I saw Lina in her room, sitting on the bed writing something. I thought it was an abnormal thing.\n[1963-07-31T17:10:00] Renting House | I saw her place the notebook on her knees, squinting her eyes, her forehead furrowed. I saw my book on her bed.\n[1963-07-31T17:10:05] Rentals | I saw her saying it to me. I heard, \"Your reaction was a bit too intense.\" I wondered how long it had been since I'd last seen her write?\n[1963-07-31T17:15:00] Rentals | I saw her shrug without lifting her eyes from the notebook. She had been there all afternoon, writing nonstop.\n[1963-07-31T20:00:00] Renting House | I saw her getting ready in the evening, as if her husband were coming, and she had the car take us to Mergellina.\n[1963-07-31T20:15:00] Mergellina | I saw her ask her daughter to lend her the lipstick and rouge, and she applied a little to her mouth and cheeks. What surprised me was that Nunzia had never been in the sun; she was very pale.\n[1963-07-31T20:15:05] Mergellina | I heard her say, \"I don't want to be like a dead person.\"\n[1963-07-31T20:20:00] Mergellina | I saw that we soon met the two young men, who were standing at the bar entrance like sentinels beside a guard post.\n[1963-07-31T20:25:00] Mergellina | I saw Bruno had just changed his shirt, he was still wearing shorts, while Nino was in long pants, a white shirt so bright it almost blinded me, his hair was very unruly.\n[1963-07-31T20:25:05] Mergellina | I saw him struggling to comb his hair into place, which made him look less handsome than usual. I saw that they noticed Nunzia had also come, and immediately became uncomfortable.\n[1963-07-31T20:30:00] Mergellina | I saw us sit down at a table under the eaves of the bar entrance, and we ordered a layer cake of ice cream.\n[1963-07-31T20:35:00] Mergellina | I saw that Nunzia couldn't stop talking. I thought that what surprised us was.\n[1963-07-31T20:40:00] Mergellina | I saw her just talking to two boys, praising Nino's mother, remembering how beautiful she had been at that time; she also talked about some things from the war, and the events that happened to us in Mergellina.\n[1963-07-31T20:45:00] Mergellina | I saw her ask Nino if he remembered, and he said he didn't. She always answered with certainty. I heard, \"You go ask your mother, she's sure to remember.\"\n[1963-07-31T20:50:00] Mergellina | I saw Lina become very impatient right away. She said she was going to call Stefano, and then she went into the bar, where there was a phone booth.\n[1963-07-31T20:55:00] Mergellina | I saw Nino suddenly become completely silent, and Bruno immediately took his place in speaking to Nunzia. I thought to myself that, at this moment, he wasn't acting as hesitant as he usually did when we were talking alone, and that annoyed me.\n[1963-07-31T21:00:00] Mergellina | I saw Nino suddenly say something, then he stood up and walked into the bar. I heard, \"I'm sorry. I'll be right back.\"\n[1963-07-31T21:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Nunzia was uneasy; she whispered in my ear. \"I heard, 'He's not going to pay, is he? I'm the oldest here; I should be the one to pay.'\"\n[1963-07-31T21:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Bruno hear her words and declare that the money had already been paid, how could they let a lady pay for it.\n[1963-07-31T21:15:00] Mergellina | I saw Nunzia immediately stop talking, then asked about her father's sausage factory, and boasted about her husband and son, saying they were also bosses, that they had a shoe factory.\n[1963-07-31T21:20:00] Mergellina | I was worried because Lina hadn't come back yet. I left Nunzia and Bruno talking and went into the bar myself.\n[1963-07-31T21:25:00] Mergellina | When did the calls between Lina and Stefano become so long?\n[1963-07-31T21:30:00] Mergellina | I checked both phone booths, and they were empty.\n[1963-07-31T21:35:00] Mergellina | I looked around, and I stood there, hindering the boss's children from serving the guests.\n[1963-07-31T21:35:05] Mergellina | I saw that at this moment there was an open door, used for ventilation, and it faced a courtyard. I smelled the old tires mixed with the odor of the chicken coop coming from there.\n[1963-07-31T21:35:10] Mergellina | I saw myself hesitantly leaning forward, the courtyard was empty, but I discovered an opening in the wall from which I could see a garden.\n[1963-07-31T21:35:15] Mergellina | I saw myself walking through the yard filled with rusted scrap metal, and I already saw Lina and Nino before entering the garden.\n[1963-07-31T21:35:20] Mergellina | I saw them hugging each other tightly [intimate act], one of his hands slipped under her skirt, she pushed him away, but at the same time she was also [intimate act] with him. I saw the summer night's light outlining the shapes of the plants.\n[1963-07-31T21:40:00] Mergellina | I saw it and immediately stepped back, trying not to make a sound.\n[1963-07-31T21:45:00] Mergellina | I saw myself back at the bar, telling Nunzia that Lina was still on the phone. \"I heard they're fighting?\"  \n\"No.\"\n[1963-07-31T21:45:05] Mergellina | I thought about how I felt as if I were on fire, but those flames were cold, and I didn't feel any pain.\n[1963-07-31T21:45:10] Mergellina | I thought about how she had married, only a little over a year ago, and I painfully reflected.\n[1963-07-31T21:50:00] Mergellina | I saw Lina returning alone, and Nino hadn't come back yet. I saw her as seemingly flawless.\n[1963-07-31T21:50:05] Mergellina | I thought about it, but I could feel the mess in her clothes and her body.\n[1963-07-31T21:55:00] Mergellina | I waited a while, but still didn't see Nino. I thought to myself that I felt hatred for both of them.\n[1963-07-31T21:55:05] Mergellina | I saw Lina stand up and say. I heard, \"Let's go, it's getting late.\"\n[1963-07-31T22:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that we had already gotten into the car to go home, when Nino ran over, happily greeting us. I heard \"See you tomorrow!\" he shouted.\n[1963-07-31T22:00:05] Mergellina | I thought to myself that I had never seen him so enthusiastic before.\n[1963-07-31T22:00:10] Mergellina | I saw that I could only keep my hand to my mouth. I thought, for them, Lina's marriage wasn't a problem, but the thing I had seen with my own eyes, so real and certain, made me feel a bit sick.\n[1963-07-31T23:00:00] Renting house | I saw Lina go home and immediately [intimate act] with someone. I lay in bed in vain, waiting for her to come over and tell me what had happened, and what was going to happen.\n[1963-07-31T23:05:00] Renting House | I thought that by now, I realized she didn't know what was going to happen back then.\n[1963-08-01T15:00:00] Chitala Beach | I thought, like this, day by day, a kind of happiness began to spread.\n[1963-08-01T15:05:00] Chitala Beach | I saw Lina taking my book to read, and this no longer annoyed me. Instead, I found it a beautiful thing.\n[1963-08-01T15:10:00] Chitala Beach | When we were discussing, Lina started to express her own ideas, and Nino was listening carefully, as if he couldn't find a way to argue back, which made me feel good too.\n[1963-08-01T15:15:00] Chitara Beach | What made me extremely happy was that, in such situations, he would suddenly stop talking to her and start discussing with me instead, as if doing so helped him regain his own perspective.\n[1963-08-01T15:20:00] Chitala Beach | I remember once when Lina talked about the book she had read about Hiroshima, something similar happened. I thought about the heated discussion the book had sparked, because I knew that Nino was critical of America.\n[1963-08-01T15:25:00] Chitala Beach | I thought about how he disliked the military base that the US had established in San Gregorio Armeno, yet he was deeply attracted by their way of life. He said he wanted to study it.\n[1963-08-01T15:30:00] Chitara Beach | I felt hurt when Lina said that the atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. on Japan was a crime, even more serious than a military crime, and had little to do with war anymore—it was an attack on dignity.",

    "text": "[1963-08-01T15:35:00] Chitala Beach | I saw him speaking very carefully. I heard, \"Do you remember the Pearl Harbor incident?\"\n[1963-08-01T15:40:00] Chitara Beach | I didn't know what the Pearl Harbor incident was, but I found out that Lina did.\n[1963-08-01T15:45:00] Chitala Beach | I saw her tell Nino that the nature of the Pearl Harbor incident and the Hiroshima incident were completely different and couldn't be compared. Pearl Harbor was a very despicable military action, but Hiroshima was a very foolish and terrible act of retaliation, even worse than retaliation—it was a Nazi massacre. She concluded with that. I heard him say, \"Americans should be sent to a military tribunal as the most despicable war criminals, what they did was just to scare the people who are still alive into completely giving up.\"\n[1963-08-01T15:50:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that in the heated argument, Nino didn't fight back but instead fell into a troubled silence.\n[1963-08-01T15:55:00] Chitala Beach | I saw and then he spoke to me as if Lina wasn't even there.\n[1963-08-01T16:00:00] Chitara Beach | I saw him say that the incident itself was not driven by cruelty or revenge, but to end that brutal war once and for all, precisely through that new type of weapon that would end all wars.\n[1963-08-01T16:05:00] Chitala Beach | I saw him speaking in a low voice, his eyes looking straight into mine, as if he cared only about my approval.\n[1963-08-01T16:10:00] Citala Beach | I thought it was a very beautiful moment, and he was very handsome at that moment.\n[1963-08-01T16:15:00] Chitala Beach | I was so excited at that moment that tears burst from my eyes and I couldn't hold them back anymore.\n[1963-08-02T19:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw that Friday had come again, a very hot day, and we spent most of our time in the water. I thought, suddenly I felt something was broken.\n[1963-08-02T19:30:00] On the way home | I saw us on the way home, just said goodbye to two young men, and the sun was about to set. I saw the blue sky covered with red clouds.\n[1963-08-02T19:35:00] On the way home | After a few hours of high spirits, Pinocchia suddenly became silent. She threw her bag on the ground and sat by the roadside, shouting angrily—but very quietly, almost like a moan.\n[1963-08-02T19:40:00] On the way home | I saw Lina squint her eyes, staring at her sister-in-law as if looking at something very ugly that she couldn't bear to face.\n[1963-08-02T19:45:00] On the way home | I saw myself approaching her with some concern and asked. I heard \"Pinocchio, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?\"  \n\"I can't stand this wet swimsuit.\"  \n\"But our swimsuits are all wet too.\"\n[1963-08-02T19:50:00] On the way home | I heard, \"I can't stand it anymore!\"\n\"Take your time, get up, let's go. Aren't you hungry?\"\n\"Don't tell me to take my time! When you say that, it really gets on my nerves. I can't stand you anymore, Elena, and your 'take your time' nonsense.\"\n[1963-08-02T19:55:00] On the way home | I saw her start to cry, patting her thigh all the while.\n[1963-08-02T20:00:00] On the way home | I saw that I realized Lina hadn't waited for us; she had already walked away alone. I thought to myself that she made this decision not because she was annoyed or indifferent, but because of some very intense reason, one that seemed to burn her as much as being near us.\n[1963-08-02T20:05:00] On the way home | I saw myself helping Pinocchia stand up and holding her bag.\n[1963-08-02T21:00:00] Renting house | I saw that Pinochietta gradually calmed down, but that night she kept a sour face, as if we had done something to hurt her.\n[1963-08-02T21:30:00] Renting house | I saw that later she wasn't even polite to Nunzia, saying the noodles were undercooked. Lina sighed and then gave her a furious verbal beating in the local dialect.\n[1963-08-02T22:00:00] Renting House | I saw the night when Pinocchia decided to sleep in my room.\n[1963-08-02T23:00:00] Renting house | I saw her sleeping restlessly. The two of them were crammed into such a tiny room that they couldn't even catch their breath, and their bodies were drenched with sweat, soaking through their clothes.\n[1963-08-03T04:00:00] Rentals | I saw that I later had to open the window, but I was immediately surrounded by mosquitoes. I couldn't sleep at all, so I got up as soon as it was light.\n[1963-08-03T05:00:00] Renting House | I saw three or four mosquito bites on my face, and I felt completely unable to show my face in public. I thought my mood was also very bad now.\n[1963-08-03T05:10:00] Rentals | I saw myself going to the kitchen, and Nunzia was already washing our clothes.\n[1963-08-03T05:15:00] Rentals | I saw that Lina was also up, she had already drunk her milk and was looking at another one of my books. I thought about when she might have taken it.\n[1963-08-03T05:20:00] Renting House | I saw her look at me with a scrutinizing gaze as soon as I came in. She made an innocent face and asked me a question that surprised me. I heard, \"How is Pinocchio?\"  \n\"I don't know.\"\n[1963-08-03T05:25:00] Renting house | I heard, \"You're angry?\"  \n\"Yes, I didn't sleep all night, look at my face.\"  \n\"Can't tell.\"  \n\"That's because you see nothing at all.\"\n[1963-08-03T05:30:00] Renting House | I heard, \"Nino and Bruno will also be invisible.\"  \n\"What does that have to do with them?\"  \n\"Do you care about Nino?\"  \n\"I've told you a hundred times, I don't care about him.\"\n[1963-08-03T05:35:00] Rentals | I heard, \"Don't get excited.\"\n\"I'm calm.\"\n\"We have to be careful with Pinocchia.\"\n\"You have to be careful with her. She's your sister-in-law, not mine.\"\n\"Are you angry?\"\n\"Yes, yes, yes.\"\n[1963-08-03T09:00:00] On the way to the beach | I saw us walking nervously toward the beach. I saw that the day was even hotter than the previous one, and bad mood seemed to spread like an infection, infecting all of us.\n[1963-08-03T09:10:00] On the way to the beach | I saw that on the way, Pinocchia realized she had forgotten her towel and had another fit.\n[1963-08-03T09:15:00] On the way to the beach | I saw Lina walking forward with her head down, not even looking back. I heard \"I'll go get it.\" I volunteered.  \n\"No, I want to go home. I don't want to go to the beach anymore.\"\n[1963-08-03T09:20:00] On the way to the beach | I heard, \"Do you feel unwell?\"  \n\"I'm fine.\"  \n\"Then why?\"  \n\"Look at my stomach.\"\n[1963-08-03T09:25:00] On the way to the beach | I looked at her stomach and, without thinking, said. \"I heard, 'What about me? Look at my face, it's been bitten by mosquitoes so badly.'\"\n[1963-08-03T09:30:00] On the way to the beach | I saw her start shouting at me, saying, \"You're a fool!\" Then she quickened her pace and caught up with Lina.\n[1963-08-03T10:00:00] Beach | I saw that we had reached the beach, and she immediately apologized to me, saying, \"You're so honest, so proper,\" which made me very angry. I heard, \"I'm very honest?\"  \n\"I wanted to say you're good.\"  \n\"I'm not good at all.\"\n[1963-08-03T10:05:00] Beach | I saw Lina keep staring at the sea in the direction of Mergellina, trying not to be affected by us. Finally, she said coldly. I heard, \"Stop fighting, they're coming.\"\n[1963-08-03T10:10:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchia mutter, \"Your one has come.\" Suddenly her voice softened. She applied lipstick to her lips, even though she had already put on plenty.\n[1963-08-03T10:15:00] Beach | I thought about the two boys' feelings, which were even worse than ours.\n[1963-08-03T10:20:00] Beach | I saw Nino speaking to Lina in a mocking tone. I heard, \"Tonight, your husbands are all coming, right?\"  \n\"Of course.\"  \n\"What fun things are you going to do?\"  \n\"We'll eat, drink, and then go to sleep.\"\n[1963-08-03T10:25:00] Beach | I heard, \"What about tomorrow?\"  \n\"Tomorrow we eat, drink, and then go to sleep.\"  \n\"Will they be there on Sunday night?\"  \n\"No, on Sunday we eat, drink, and take a nap in the afternoon.\"\n[1963-08-03T10:30:00] Beach | I saw myself hiding my sarcastic tone and forcing myself to speak. \"I heard, 'I'm free. I don't eat or drink, I don't sleep.'\"\n[1963-08-03T10:35:00] Beach | I saw Nino looking at me as if he had just noticed a problem he'd never seen before. He touched my right cheekbone with one hand—I had been bitten by a mosquito there, and it was swollen more noticeably than the rest.\n[1963-08-03T10:40:00] Beach | I saw him speaking to me very seriously. I heard, \"Okay, we'll meet here tomorrow morning at seven o'clock, then we'll go hiking. After that, we'll stay by the sea until late. What do you think?\"\n[1963-08-03T10:45:00] Beach | I felt a wave of joy surging through my veins, and I said quite naturally. I heard, \"Okay, seven o'clock in the morning, I'll bring something to eat.\"\n[1963-08-03T10:50:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio looking somewhat disappointed and asked. \"I heard, 'What about us?'\"\n[1963-08-03T10:55:00] Beach | I saw him mutter something, and when he said the word \"husband,\" it was as if he were speaking of a toad, a venomous snake, or a spider. I heard, \"You have husbands.\"\n[1963-08-03T11:00:00] Beach | I saw Pinocchio stand up suddenly after hearing those words and start walking toward the seashore.\n[1963-08-03T11:05:00] Beach | I saw myself making an excuse for her. I heard, \"She's been a bit too sensitive lately. It's because of her [childbearing condition], she usually isn't like this.\"\n[1963-08-03T11:10:00] Beach | I saw Bruno still speaking in his patient tone. I heard, \"I'll go with her to buy a coconut.\"\n[1963-08-03T11:15:00] Beach | I saw our eyes following him as he walked steadily across the sand. He moved with ease, as if the scorching heat beneath his feet didn't even exist. I saw that he was small in stature but solid, with a broad chest and strong thighs.\n[1963-08-03T11:20:00] Beach | \"I saw Lina say as Bruno and Pinochia walked towards the beach.\" I heard, \"Let's go swimming.\"\n[1963-08-03T11:30:00] Beach | I saw the three of us walking toward the sea, I was in the middle, and the two of them were on either side.\n[1963-08-03T11:35:00] Beach | I saw Nino say to me, \"See you at seven tomorrow morning.\" I found it hard to describe my feelings at that moment, a sudden sense of victory.\n[1963-08-03T11:35:05] Beach | I thought, of course, I felt sorry for Pinocchio's fickle mood, but that sorrow was very slight and hardly affected my cheerful mood.\n[1963-08-03T11:35:10] Beach | I thought about how I finally felt satisfied with myself, and a long, exciting weekend was waiting for me; at that moment, I felt proud to be there, with the most important person in my life, someone who even my parents and my brothers and sisters couldn't compare to.\n[1963-08-03T11:40:00] Beach | I saw myself holding both of their hands and letting out a happy cry, pulling them into the cold, crashing sea water.\n[1963-08-03T11:41:00] Beach | I saw us, as if we were one person, plunge into the sea.",

I thought about how I've never liked the cold seawater wetting my hair, and the feeling of seawater on my scalp and in my ears.\n[1963-08-03T11:43:00] Sea | I saw myself immediately breaking the surface, shaking off the water.\n[1963-08-03T11:45:00] Sea | I saw them start swimming, so I began to swim too in order to keep up. I immediately realized it was a very difficult thing to do.\n[1963-08-03T11:46:00] Sea | I realized I couldn't swim straight ahead. My head was underwater, and I could calmly move my arms, but my right arm was stronger than my left, so I kept drifting off course. I was also worried about swallowing water.\n[1963-08-03T11:50:00] Sea | I thought about how I tried to keep up with them. I'm nearsighted, but I still hoped I'd always be able to see them. I thought they would stop.\n[1963-08-03T11:55:00] Sea | I saw my heart beating fast, then I slowed down until it finally stopped, floating on the water, watching them confidently swim one after another toward the distance.\n[1963-08-03T12:00:00] Sea | I saw that, perhaps, they had swum too far. I had done the same—I had swum beyond the usual safe line, just on a whim. Normally, from that line, I could swim back to shore with just two strokes.\n[1963-08-03T12:05:00] Sea | I saw that Lina had never crossed that line either, but now she was competing with Nino. I knew that although she had little experience, she never gave in, and she swam farther and farther away with him.\n[1963-08-03T12:10:00] Sea | I thought about how worried I would be if she lost her strength, if she felt unwell. Nino is a good swimmer; he would help Lina, but what if he cramps up? What if he couldn't hold on either?\n[1963-08-03T12:15:00] Sea | I looked around, the waves pushed me to the left, I couldn't wait for them here, I should go back to the shore.\n[1963-08-03T12:15:05] Sea | I looked down. The sky-blue had turned into a deep blue, and the color below grew darker and darker, like night, even though the sun was shining on the sea, which shimmered with glints of white, as if connecting to the horizon. I thought that had been a mistake.\n[1963-08-03T12:15:10] Sea | I thought I felt a deep chasm beneath my feet, without any solid ground, like a death trap that could spring open at any moment, piercing me, catching me, tearing me apart, dragging me down into the depths of the sea.\n[1963-08-03T12:20:00] Sea | I forced myself to calm down and shouted, \"Lina!\" I saw, but I wasn't wearing my glasses, so I couldn't see anything. All I could see was a vast expanse of white sea.\n[1963-08-03T12:25:00] Sea | I thought about my outing with Nino the next day as I slowly swam back, floating on my back, moving my arms and legs, and finally reaching the shore.\n[1963-08-03T12:30:00] Beach | I saw myself sitting in the shallow water, straining to look at their dark heads far out on the sea, like two buoys, and I felt a sense of relief.\n[1963-08-03T12:35:00] Beach | I saw that Lina was not only fine, but she had also caught up with Nino, swimming just as fast as him. I thought about how enthusiastic, exaggerated, and brave she was.\n[1963-08-03T12:40:00] Beach | I saw myself stand up and walk over to Bruno, who was sitting next to us. \"I heard 'Where's Pinocchio?' I asked.\"\n[1963-08-03T12:40:05] Beach | I saw him smile shyly. I heard, \"She's gone.\" I thought that he was trying to hide his sadness.\n[1963-08-03T12:40:10] Beach | I heard, \"Where did she go?\"\n\"She went home. She said she wanted to pack her things.\"\n\"Things?\"\n\"She wants to leave here. She can't stay away from her husband for so long.\"\n[1963-08-03T12:50:00] Beach | I saw myself taking my things, and I made him watch Nino, especially watching Lina. I ran back, all wet, to see what was wrong with Pinocchio.\n[1963-08-03T14:00:00] Renting House | I knew it was a terrible afternoon, and the situation got worse by nightfall. I saw Pinocchio really packing her suitcase, and Nunzia couldn't calm her down.\n[1963-08-03T14:10:00] Rentals | \"I don't want you to worry,\" Nunzia calmly reassured her, \"Rino can wash his own underwear, he can cook, and his father is at home, plus there are other friends. He won't think you're here just for your own pleasure. He understands you're here to rest, to have a beautiful, healthy baby.\"\n[1963-08-03T14:15:00] Rentals | \"I heard, 'Come on! Let me help you put things away. I've never taken a vacation before, but thank God, we have money now. But we can't waste it. It's not a sin to enjoy ourselves, and your financial situation allows it. Pinocchio, my dear daughter!\"\n[1963-08-03T14:20:00] Renting house | I heard, \"Rino has been working for a whole week, he's very tired now, and he's coming right away. Don't let him see you like this. You know him, he gets worried easily, and when he gets worried, he gets angry. And what happens when he gets angry?\"\n[1963-08-03T14:25:00] Rentals | I heard, \"You want to go back to him, he's already left, he'll be with you soon, now you've met, you should be happy together. Now you look like this, it will make everyone unhappy. Do you think that's good?\"\n[1963-08-03T14:30:00] Renting House | I saw Nunzia pleading with all her might, but Pinocchia wouldn't listen at all.\n[1963-08-03T14:40:00] Rentals | I joined the effort to persuade her, and finally we took the things out of her suitcase, only for her to put them back in again and start shouting. When she calmed down, we began all over again.\n[1963-08-03T15:00:00] Rentals | I saw Lina come back later. She leaned against the door frame, frowning as she looked at us. A long wrinkle appeared on her forehead, and she just stood there, watching Pinocchio's confused state.\n[1963-08-03T15:05:00] Renting House | I saw her nod, but she said nothing. I heard \"Are you okay?\" I asked.  \n\"You're swimming really well now.\"\n[1963-08-03T15:10:00] Rentals | I know that once again her sister-in-law was insisting on leaving, saying goodbye to this place, and regretting all the things she hadn't done, sighing for her husband Rino. She contradictory said she couldn't bear to leave the sea, the scent of the garden, and the beach. I thought about the expression on her face, which looked both happy and sad. It was clear that Pinocchio's stubborn mischief had finally become more than she could stand.\n[1963-08-03T15:15:00] Renting house | I saw that although Lina said nothing, she didn't utter her usual cruel and mocking words. Finally, she coldly muttered a sentence. I heard, \"They're coming soon.\" I thought it wasn't about asking everyone to return to normal emotions, but more like announcing something urgent that threatened everyone.\n[1963-08-03T15:20:00] Renting House | At that moment, Pinocchia completely broke down. She threw herself onto the suitcase that had already been closed.\n[1963-08-03T15:30:00] Renting House | I saw Lina make a face, then went back to get herself ready. She didn't take long and came back, tying her dark hair up. I saw her wearing a very tight red dress.\n[1963-08-03T16:00:00] Renting House | I saw her be the first to hear the sound of the \"Lametta\" motorcycle, stick her head out the window, and greet someone with enthusiasm, then speak to Pinocchia in a tone full of disdain, very seriously. I heard, \"You'd better go wash your face and change out of that wet swimsuit.\"\n[1963-08-03T16:05:00] Renting House | I saw Pinocchio looking at her, but she showed no reaction. I thought of how the two girls quickly exchanged something between them, a secret projection of their emotions, tiny molecules emitted from the depths of their hearts that left them broken and wounded. It was the trembling within that long second.\n[1963-08-03T16:05:05] Apartment for Rent | I saw that I had captured it, I didn't understand exactly what it was, but they did, they understood each other, they shared an unspoken understanding. I thought that Pinocchio knew that Lina understood her situation, and she realized that Lina wanted to help her, even if it was with disdain. So she did what Lina told her to.",

When she opened it and saw a gold chain with a heart-shaped pendant, she let out a joyful cry.\n[1963-08-03T16:50:00] Rentals | I saw, of course, that Rino had also brought a small gift for Pinocchio, and Pinocchio did his best to act as excited as Lina. I thought of her, but she still couldn't hide her pain and vulnerability.\n[1963-08-03T16:55:00] Renting House | I saw Rino's affectionate gestures, his embraces, and the gifts, which made her hastily conceal her true feelings, restoring her to the image of a happy wife. I thought of it, but only for a short time.\n[1963-08-03T17:00:00] Renting House | I saw her lips begin to tremble, her tears like a fountain, and she spoke in a choked voice. I heard, \"I've already packed my luggage. I don't want to stay here for another minute. I just want to be with you.\"\n[1963-08-03T17:05:00] Renting House | I saw Rino smile, and this intense love moved him deeply. I heard him say, \"I just want to be with you.\"\n[1963-08-03T17:05:05] Renting House | I thought that in the end, he understood that his wife wasn't just saying how much she missed him—she was saying she really wanted to leave, and she had already made up her mind. She expressed her decision to go through that unbearable crying.\n[1963-08-03T17:10:00] Rentals | I saw them close the door and start discussing, but their discussion was brief.\n[1963-08-03T17:15:00] Renting House | I saw Rino come back to us, shouting at his mother. \"I heard, 'Mom, I want to know what happened.'\"\n[1963-08-03T17:15:05] Rentals | I saw that his mother hadn't answered yet, and he glared fiercely at his sister. I heard, \"If it's your fault, if it's really your fault, I'll break your face...\"\n[1963-08-03T17:15:10] Rentals | I saw and then he shouted something toward his wife's direction. \"I heard, 'Enough! I've had enough, I'm fed up, get out here, I'm tired, I want to eat.\"\n[1963-08-03T17:20:00] Rentals | I saw Pinocchia coming out with puffy eyes. After seeing her, Stefano made a joke to ease the mood, hugging his sister and sighing as he said. I heard, \"Ah, my dear little sister, you women really drive us crazy.\"\n[1963-08-03T17:25:00] Renting House | I saw that, and it seemed he suddenly remembered his previous outburst. He kissed Lina's lips. I thought about seeing another couple so unhappy, and he felt very happy, because the two of them were now unexpectedly cheerful.\n[1963-08-03T18:00:00] Renting house | I saw everyone sitting at the table, and Nunzia silently served us rice.\n[1963-08-03T18:10:00] Renting House | I saw it this time, but Rino couldn't take it anymore. He shouted that he wasn't hungry, and he threw the full plate of clam noodles into the middle of the kitchen.\n[1963-08-03T18:15:00] Renting House | I saw something that made me feel very scared, and Pinocchio started to cry.\n[1963-08-03T18:20:00] Renting House | I saw Stefano's tone also changed, becoming very impatient, and he said to his wife. I heard, \"Let's go, I'll take you to a restaurant.\"\n[1963-08-03T18:25:00] Rentals | I saw them leave the kitchen amid Nunzia and Pinocchia's protests. After a moment of silence, we heard the sound of the \"Lametta\" motorcycle starting up.\n[1963-08-03T19:00:00] Renting House | I saw myself helping Nunzia clean the floor, then Rino stood up and went back to his room.\n[1963-08-03T19:10:00] Rentals | I saw Pinocchia lock herself in the bathroom, but a little while later, she went back to the room and found her husband, then closed the door behind her.\n[1963-08-03T19:20:00] Rentals | At that moment, Nunzia started muttering, as if she had forgotten that she was a very gentle and good-tempered mother-in-law. I heard, \"Did you see that rotten woman making Rino suffer so much! What's wrong with her?\"\n[1963-08-03T19:25:00] Renting House | I told her I didn't know, and in fact I really didn't. All evening I was comforting her, rationalizing Pinocchio's feelings.\n[1963-08-03T19:30:00] Renting House | I heard myself say that if I were pregnant, I would also want to stay by my husband's side, feeling protected and safe, taking on the responsibility of being a mother, while he took on the responsibility of being a father.\n[1963-08-03T19:35:00] Renting House | I heard myself say that if Lina had come here for [pregnancy status], it was obvious that the treatment was very effective, that the sea had done its work on her. Just look at the expression of happiness on her face when Stefano arrived.\n[1963-08-03T19:40:00] Rentals | I heard that Pinocchio is very beloved, and she longs to be in love with Rino every minute of every day, otherwise her heart would feel uneasy and painful.\n[1963-08-03T20:00:00] Renting House | I saw that I and Nunzia had already cleaned the kitchen, and all the pots and pans were spotless. She said to me. I heard, \"Elena, you really know how to counsel people! You're sure to have a bright future.\" I saw that moment, and the atmosphere was very peaceful.\n[1963-08-03T20:05:00] Renting House | I saw tears welling up in her eyes as she muttered, \"Lina should have gone to school, that was her destiny.\" \"I heard her say, 'But my husband didn't want her to go to school,' and then she continued, 'I couldn't do anything about it. At that time, we didn't have any money, otherwise she would have been like you. But then she got married, took another path, and there was no going back. We're all at the mercy of life...\"\n[1963-08-03T20:10:00] Rentals | I saw her wish me happiness. I heard her say, \"You're looking for a boy like you, who has been to school.\" She asked me if I really liked Nino's son.\n[1963-08-03T20:15:00] Rentals | I said I didn't see it, but I told her that the next day I was going to go hiking with Nino. She was very happy and made me some sandwiches with sausage and cheese.\n[1963-08-03T20:20:00] Renting House | I saw myself wrapping the sandwiches in paper, putting them into a bag, along with the towel I used to go to the beach and other things.\n[1963-08-03T20:25:00] Renting House | I saw her tell me to be careful when I left, and then we said goodnight to each other.\n[1963-08-03T21:00:00] Rentals | I saw myself returning to my small room, closing the door and starting to read, but it was hard to concentrate. I thought to myself that going out early the next day would definitely be very pleasant, with fresh and fragrant air.\n[1963-08-03T21:05:00] Renting House | I thought about how much I loved the sea, even the crying and quarrels of Pinocchia, and the reconciliation between Lina and Stefano, whose feelings grew stronger every week.\n[1963-08-03T21:10:00] Renting House | I thought about how much I longed for Nino! I wished that every day he would be by my side, with my friends, how happy it would be, even though they didn't know each other, even though sometimes we couldn't hide some bad feelings deep within our hearts.\n[1963-08-03T23:00:00] Renting House | I saw Stefano and Lina returning. I heard the door open and close, heard them speaking in hushed tones, and heard the sound of water running from the tap.\n[1963-08-03T23:30:00] Renting House | I saw myself turn off the light, and finally, I fell asleep. I heard the rustling of reeds outside the window and the commotion in the chicken coop.\n[1963-08-04T02:00:00] Rentals | I saw it, but I immediately woke up—someone was in my room! \"I did it,\" Lina said in a low voice.\n[1963-08-04T02:00:05] Rentals | I saw her sit on the edge of my bed, and I wanted to turn on the light. I heard, \"Don't turn on the light.\" She said, \"I'll stay for just a little while.\"",

She leaned on Nino to save some strength, floating on the water.\n[1963-08-04T02:10:05] Renting House | I saw how Nino, taking advantage of her closeness, pressed his lips tightly against hers. She immediately closed her mouth, and he tried to use his tongue to open it, but he never succeeded.\n[1963-08-04T02:10:10] Rentals | I saw her push Nino and say. I heard him say, \"Are you crazy? I'm already married.\"  \nNino's answer was, \"I fell in love with you earlier than your husband, even back when we competed in the class competition, I was already in love with you.\"\n[1963-08-04T02:10:15] Rentals | I saw Lina tell him never to do that again, and then they swam toward the shore, she said. I heard, \"He was so forceful, he hurt my lips, and they still hurt now.\"\n[1963-08-04T02:10:20] Rentals | I saw her waiting for my reaction, but I controlled myself, not asking any questions or making any comments.\n[1963-08-04T02:10:25] Renting House | I saw her advise me not to go climbing with him the next day unless Bruno also went.\n[1963-08-04T02:10:30] Renting House | I told her coldly that if Nino had [intimate act] with me, I wouldn't have any problem, because I wasn't married and didn't have a boyfriend, I added. I heard her say, \"The only regret is that I don't like him. If he were to [intimate act] me, my feelings would be like [intimate act] a dead mouse.\"\n[1963-08-04T02:10:35] Rentals | I saw that, so I pretended I couldn't help but yawn. She looked at me, then went to sleep. I thought about how I felt that her gaze contained tenderness and admiration.\n[1963-08-04T03:00:00] Rentals | I cried all the way from the moment she left the room until the next dawn.\n[1963-08-04T03:30:00] Rentals | I thought that by now, whenever I recalled that pain, I didn't understand my own self at all. But that night, I felt as if I had no reason to go on living.\n[1963-08-04T03:35:00] Renting House | I wondered why Nino was the kind of person he was. He kissed Nadia, he kissed me, and he even kissed Lina. How could he possibly be the person I loved, the serious, thoughtful person I thought he was?\n[1963-08-04T03:40:00] Renting House | I thought about it for several hours, but I still couldn't accept the fact: he was profound when facing the great issues of the world, yet so superficial when it came to personal feelings.\n[1963-08-04T03:45:00] Renting house | I thought about how I began to think about myself, and I felt as if I had suddenly understood something. Like this short, plump girl, glasses on, hardworking but not smart, pretending to be cultured, knowing a lot, but actually not at all. Even though it was just a holiday, how could I possibly expect him to like me?\n[1963-08-04T03:50:00] Renting House | I wondered if, besides that, I had ever really thought about him. I analyzed my actions very carefully. No, I couldn't clearly express my desires.\n[1963-08-04T03:55:00] Renting House | I thought to myself that not only did I hide my feelings from others, but I also doubted myself, without being truly certain.\n[1963-08-04T04:00:00] Renting House | Why hadn't I ever clearly told Lina how I felt about Nino? After she told me that thing at night, why hadn't I shouted out the pain this revelation had stirred up inside me? Why hadn't I told her that Nino had also kissed me before he kissed her?\n[1963-08-04T04:05:00] Renting House | I wondered what had driven me to act that way. I controlled my deep-seated emotions, because I was afraid of my inner longing for things, for people, for praise, and for success?\n[1963-08-04T04:10:00] Rentals | I thought about how I feared that wild desire, which would erupt inside me when my longing wasn't satisfied, leading to even worse feelings—like the one that made me compare Nino's beautiful mouth to a dead mouse?\n[1963-08-04T04:15:00] Renting House | I thought, even though I've always been pushing myself forward, in reality I've always been ready to retreat? Why, when things don't go my way, do I always put on a sweet smile and let out a happy laugh? Why do I inevitably find reasonable excuses for those who have made me suffer?\n[1963-08-04T05:00:00] Renting House | I saw myself crying while asking these questions, and the day had already broken. I thought I had figured out what had happened.\n[1963-08-04T05:05:00] Renting House | I thought that Nino truly believed he had fallen in love with Nadia; Teacher Galiani praised me, and over these years, Nino too had looked at me with admiration and affection.\n[1963-08-04T05:10:00] Renting House | I thought, but what about now? In Vomero, he met Lina, and he understood that since childhood--and perhaps forever in the future--Lina would always be his only true love.\n[1963-08-04T05:15:00] Rentals | I thought so, this is the truth of the matter. How could I blame him for this? Where was his fault? In their story, there was something intense, exalted, and selectively affectionate.\n[1963-08-04T05:20:00] Rentals | I thought of some lines from poems and novels, trying to calm myself down. Perhaps, the usefulness of school for me is just this: teaching me how to calm down.\n[1963-08-04T05:25:00] Rentals | I thought about how Lina had ignited a flame in Nino's heart, which had burned within him for many years, though he had never been aware of it. Now, the flame was burning again.\n[1963-08-04T05:30:00] Renting House | What other choice did he have but to love Lina? Even though Lina didn't love him, even though she was already married and could not come near, could not possess: marriage was eternal, until death, unless at the last judgment, when in the blizzard of hell this marriage would finally dissolve.\n[1963-08-04T05:35:00] Renting House | I saw when dawn arrived. I thought I had everything figured out, that Nino's love for Lina was impossible, just like my love for him.\n[1963-08-04T05:40:00] Renting House | I thought that only in this impossible situation, in the middle of the sea, Nino's [intimate act] toward Lina made sense, that [intimate act].\n[1963-08-04T05:45:00] Rentals | I realized this wasn't a choice—it just happened: especially because Lina knew how to make things happen, and I couldn't. What am I going to do now?\n[1963-08-04T05:50:00] Renting House | I thought about going to the meeting, we would climb Mount Ema? Or not? Tonight I'm going back to San Gregorio Armeno with Stefano and Rino, I'll say my mother wrote me a letter and she needs me to go back and help.\n[1963-08-04T05:55:00] Rentals | I know Nino loves Lina, he has touched her, how can I still go hiking with him? How can I watch them together every day, swimming further and further away in the sea?\n[1963-08-04T06:00:00] Renting House | I felt so exhausted that I fell asleep.\n[1963-08-04T06:30:00] Renting House | I saw that when I suddenly woke up, I ran off to the appointment. I thought my analysis had worked, that I really had control over the pain.",

    "text": "[1963-08-04T07:00:00] Chitala Beach | I saw myself walking onto the beach, and he was already there—Bruno didn't come. I thought I was certain he wouldn't come, but I immediately understood that he didn't want to take the trouble to find the path up the mountain, to explore those unfamiliar trails.\n[1963-08-04T07:05:00] Chitala Beach | I heard him say that if I insisted, he would go with me. I thought about it, but the weather was so hot. He predicted we would definitely be tired, and there wouldn't necessarily be anything more comfortable than swimming in the sea.\n[1963-08-04T07:10:00] Chitala Beach | I saw him say he was going to rent a small boat. I didn't expect him to say he was going to rent a small boat. I began to worry, fearing he might say he wanted to go back and study.\n[1963-08-04T07:15:00] Chitala Beach | I watched him count his money over and over again, and I also took out my own pocket money. He smiled and politely said to me. I heard, \"You've made a sandwich, I'll rent the boat.\"\n[1963-08-04T07:30:00] Sea | I saw that after a few minutes, we were already on the sea, he was rowing and I was sitting at the back of the boat. I thought I was feeling better, I said to myself, maybe Lina was lying, and Nino hadn't actually done [intimate things] with her.\n[1963-08-04T07:35:00] Sea | I thought about it, but a voice inside me said, \"Not like that!\" I am the kind of person who sometimes lies, and (especially) lies to myself; but she wasn't like that. In my memory, she never told a lie.\n[1963-08-04T07:40:00] Sea | I thought I just needed to wait, not for too long, and Nino would tell me clearly himself.\n[1963-08-04T08:00:00] Sea | I saw us arrive at the center of the sea, he dropped his oar and jumped into the water, and I followed him in.\n[1963-08-04T08:10:00] Sea | I saw him dive into the deep sea, disappearing, then soon reappearing not far away, and diving down again. I saw that he didn't swim as far as usual, disappearing into the gently undulating waves of the sea.\n[1963-08-04T08:20:00] Sea | I saw them only daring to swim around the boat at close range, not venturing too far away. Later, I got tired and clumsily climbed aboard the boat. I thought I wasn't very familiar with the deep sea, and I was a little scared.\n[1963-08-04T08:30:00] Sea | I saw that after a while, he returned to the boat and sat by the oars, beginning to row powerfully, along the shore, toward Emperor's Point.\n[1963-08-04T09:00:00] On the boat | I heard that we were glad we hadn't had to go to Ape-Meio. I thought back to that moment, and realized we had only talked about sandwiches, the hot weather, and the sea.\n[1963-08-04T09:10:00] On the boat | I saw that even though sometimes I worried about an awkward silence, I would bring up various topics as icebreakers, hoping to spark his passion for the world around him, but he didn't talk about those things. What surprised me was that he hadn't yet mentioned the questions he had seen in books, magazines, and newspapers, and his mind was elsewhere.\n[1963-08-04T09:15:00] On the boat | I saw him later abandon the oar, stare at the stone wall for a while, and also watch the gulls flying in the sky, then he asked me. I heard, \"Didn't Lina say anything to you?\"  \n\"Say what?\"\n[1963-08-04T09:15:05] On the boat | I saw him press his lips together and say awkwardly. I heard, \"Well, I'll tell you what happened: yesterday I had sex with her.\"\n[1963-08-04T10:00:00] On the boat | I saw that later that day, he kept talking about the two of them. I knew the opening line would be this.\n[1963-08-04T11:00:00] On the boat | I saw us swimming again, we went to explore the rocks and caves, we ate sandwiches and drank the water I brought. He wanted to teach me how to row, but our conversation kept coming back to the two of them.\n[1963-08-04T11:30:00] On the boat | I saw that he only talked about him and Lina, Lina and him. He didn't talk about love, he didn't say why he loved this person instead of another. The thing that struck me most was that he never turned his personal issues into universal ones, something he usually did.\n[1963-08-04T11:35:00] On the boat | I saw him constantly asking me about her and her relationship with Stefano. I heard, \"Why did she marry him?\"  \n\"Because she loved him.\"  \n\"That's impossible.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:35:05] On the boat | I heard, \"I can assure you, that's how it is.\"  \n\"She married him for money, to help her family and to secure herself.\"  \n\"If it was about money, she could have married Marcello instead.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:35:10] On the boat | I heard, \"Who is he?\"  \n\"A richer man than Stefano, who did a lot of crazy things to get her.\"  \n\"What about her?\"  \n\"She doesn't want to be with him.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:35:15] On the boat | I heard, \"So, you think she married that sausage seller because of love?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"She went swimming to [pregnancy condition]? What's that all about?\"  \n\"That's what the doctor said.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:35:20] On the boat | I heard, \"Does she want [pregnancy]?\"\n\"At first, she didn't want it, but now I don't know.\"\n\"Then does he want it?\"\n\"He really wants it.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:35:25] On the boat | I heard, \"Does he love Lina?\"  \n\"Yes, very much.\"  \n\"What about you? As an outsider, what do you think about their relationship?\"  \n\"Lina would have problems with anyone.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:35:30] On the boat | \"I heard 'that means?'\"\n\"They had a problem on their wedding day, but it was Lina's fault—she didn't know how to adapt to her new role.\"\n\"What about now?\"\n\"It's better now.\"\n\"I don't believe it.\"\n[1963-08-04T11:40:00] On the boat | I said this, and he became increasingly doubtful, but I stuck to my own view: Lina had never loved her husband as much as she did during that time.\n[1963-08-04T11:45:00] On the boat | The more I insisted on saying this, the less he believed me. I spoke in a very clear tone, saying that nothing would happen between them, and I didn't want him to have any illusions.\n[1963-08-04T13:00:00] On the boat | I thought, but the conversation wasn't over. The more I detailed my account of Lina, the more obvious it became to me that the day spent between the sea and the sky was increasingly enjoyable for him.\n[1963-08-04T13:30:00] On the boat | I thought he didn't care if every word I spoke hurt him; he wanted me to tell him everything I knew, good or bad. He wanted every hour, every minute we were together to be filled with her name.\n[1963-08-04T14:00:00] On the boat | I kept saying Lina over and over again. At first, it was painful, but over time, things began to change.\n[1963-08-04T14:30:00] On the boat | I thought and felt that day when I talked to Nino about Lina, and this might be a new way for the three of us to get along in the coming weeks.\n[1963-08-04T15:00:00] On the boat | I thought neither of us would ever have Nino, but both of us would gain his attention throughout the holiday—she as the object of his hopeless love, and me as the wise counselor who would stop him from acting out with her.\n[1963-08-04T15:30:00] On the boat | I felt a slight comfort at the thought of this possible central position; Lina came to tell me that Nino had [intimate act] her. As for him, driven by that [intimate act], he wanted to tell me what had happened, which kept him with me all day long, making me an indispensable person for both of them.\n[1963-08-04T16:00:00] On the boat | I heard, \"Do you think, she might like me?\" Later he asked me. I thought that, in reality, Nino had already become inseparable from me.\n[1963-08-04T16:05:00] On the boat | \"I heard, 'She has made her decision, Nino.'\"\n\"What decision?\"\n\"She's decided to love her husband and have a child with him. That's why she came here.\"\n[1963-08-04T16:10:00] On the boat | I heard, \"What about my love for her?\"  \n\"You loved her once and then fell in love with her again; she might feel grateful. But if you don't want to suffer, you can't expect anything.\"\n[1963-08-04T16:15:00] On the boat | I heard her say, \"The more you care about Lina and the more you appreciate her, the more cruel she becomes. She's always been like that.\"",

How could I possibly endure that kind of pain?\n[1963-08-04T19:25:00] On the way home | I thought about how I talked to Nino about Lina, and how Lina talked to me about Nino, and how from tomorrow I would witness their discussions, games, embraces, and touches.\n[1963-08-04T19:30:00] On the way home | I thought about what I would say to them after I decided to go home—that my mother had sent me back to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1963-08-04T19:40:00] Renting House | I saw it, but as I had just entered, Lina spoke to me very sternly. \"I heard, 'Where have you been? We've been looking for you. We need you, you have to help us.'\"\n[1963-08-04T20:00:00] Renting House | I know that later I found out, that day they all had a terrible time because of Pinocchia, who troubled everyone.\n[1963-08-04T20:30:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw it all, and she screamed that if her husband didn't let her go home, he didn't love her, and she was willing to die with the children. Rino had no choice but to take her back to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1963-08-05T09:00:00] Rentals | I thought that sometimes, we use meaningless words and absurd actions to cover up our real feelings.\n[1963-08-05T09:05:00] Rentals | I saw it now, after resisting for a while, I began to gradually submit to Bruno. I thought, of course, I still didn't like him, not even Antonio, I didn't particularly like him back then.\n[1963-08-05T09:10:00] Rentals | I thought about how, at different stages of our lives, whether we can feel affection for a man usually depends on whether he fits our ideal image of a man.\n[1963-08-05T09:15:00] Apartment for Rent | I knew that in the stage of Bruno Socavo's life, he was very generous and polite, and it was easy to develop some feelings for him. I realized that my refusal had nothing to do with whether I liked or disliked him; in fact, I was targeting Lina, and I wanted her to hesitate.\n[1963-08-05T09:20:00] Renting House | I thought about making her realize her situation, and the one I was trapped in. I wanted her to say to me, \"Okay, you're right, I was wrong. I won't disappear with Nino anymore at night. I won't leave you alone with Bruno anymore. From now on, I'll act like a proper married woman.\"\n[1963-08-05T09:25:00] Renting House | I saw it, but she didn't actually say it. I heard her say, \"I'll talk to Nino about this. You see, Bruno will never bother you again.\"\n[1963-08-06T09:00:00] Beach | I know that day after day passed, and we still met those two boys at nine in the morning and didn't part until midnight.\n[1963-08-06T21:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that on Tuesday night, after Lina and Stefano hung up, Nino said. I heard, \"You haven't seen Bruno's house yet. Want to go up and take a look?\"\n[1963-08-06T21:05:00] Mergellina | I saw that I would immediately refuse. I heard myself say that my stomach hurt and that I wanted to go home quickly.\n[1963-08-06T21:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Nino and Lina looking at each other, somewhat flustered, at that moment, Bruno said nothing.\n[1963-08-06T21:15:00] Mergellina | I said awkwardly, \"Maybe another time.\" I thought I sensed their displeasure.\n[1963-08-06T21:30:00] Renting House | I saw Lina say nothing, but when we were alone, she sighed. \"I heard, 'You just don't want me to be happy, Elena.'\"\n[1963-08-06T21:35:00] Renting House | I saw my answer as I said it to her. \"I heard, 'If Stefano found out that the two of us went to their place alone, he wouldn't just blame you, he'd blame me too.'\"\n[1963-08-06T22:00:00] Renting House | I saw that wasn't all; at home I also provoked Nunzia, making her dissatisfied with her daughter's behavior, getting her to criticize Lina for spending too much time sunbathing, swimming, and lingering outside at night.\n[1963-08-06T22:10:00] Apartment for Rent | I said, pretending to be the one who would ease the tension between the mother and daughter. I heard, \"Mrs. Nunzia, come have ice cream with us tomorrow night. You'll see we're not doing anything improper.\"\n[1963-08-06T22:15:00] Renting house | I saw Lina was very angry. I heard her say she'd spent the whole year buried in Capodimonte working, and she had the right to enjoy a little freedom.\n[1963-08-06T22:20:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia had also lost her patience, and she said. \"I heard, 'Lina, what are you saying? Freedom? What freedom? You're already married, you should be aware of your husband's presence. Elena can be more free, but you can't.'\"\n[1963-08-06T22:25:00] Rentals | I saw her daughter hear those words and then slam the door and leave.\n[1963-08-07T20:30:00] Rentals | I saw it, but the next day Lina still won: her mother stayed at home, and we went out to call Stefano.\n[1963-08-07T20:35:00] Renting House | I saw Nunzia pulling a face and saying to me. I heard her say, \"At eleven o'clock, you must all come back here.\"  \nI replied, \"Okay.\"\n[1963-08-07T20:35:05] Rentals | I saw her look at me with a meaningful, inquisitive gaze. I thought she was now very watchful: she had come to supervise us, but she hadn't done it properly. She was afraid we might cause some trouble, but at the same time, she thought about how her own youth had been wasted, and she felt there was nothing she could do to stop us from going out and having fun.\n[1963-08-07T20:35:10] Rentals | I saw myself assuring her several times. I heard, \"Come back at eleven o'clock.\"\n[1963-08-07T21:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that the call with Stefano lasted no more than a minute, and then Lina came out of the phone booth, and Nino asked me again. I heard, \"Tonight, you don't have any problems, Elena? Want to come see where we're staying?\"\n[1963-08-07T21:05:00] Mergellina | I heard \"Come on.\" Bruno also tried to persuade me, \"You guys have something to drink, and then go back soon.\"\n[1963-08-07T21:10:00] Bruno's house | I saw Lina agree, and I said nothing.\n[1963-08-07T21:15:00] Bruno's house | I saw that the house looked old and poorly maintained from the outside, but inside it was brand new: the cellar was clean and bright, filled with wine and sausages, and there were marble steps with iron railings.\n[1963-08-07T21:20:00] Bruno's house | I saw before me a door that looked solid, with a gleaming golden handle, and golden window frames. There were many rooms, furnished with a television, yellow sofas. The kitchen had sky-blue cabinets, and the bedrooms had wardrobes that looked like Gothic cathedrals.\n[1963-08-07T21:25:00] Bruno's House | I realized for the first time clearly that the Bruno family was indeed rich, richer than the Stefano family.\n[1963-08-07T21:30:00] Bruno's House | I thought, if my mother knew that the son of the owner of the \"Socavo Sausage\" factory had pursued me, and that I had even been a guest in his home, yet I not only failed to thank God for this blessing, but also didn't try to marry him, and instead rejected him twice, she would have killed me.\n[1963-08-07T21:35:00] Bruno's House | I thought that, precisely because I had thought of my mother, of her lame leg, I felt even more unworthy of Bruno.\n[1963-08-07T21:40:00] Bruno's House | I thought about how this house made me feel afraid, why had I been there? What was I doing?\n[1963-08-07T21:45:00] Bruno's house | I saw Lina acting very at ease, she often smiled. I thought I felt as if I had a fever, my mouth was very bitter.\n[1963-08-07T21:50:00] Bruno's house | I said \"Okay\" just to avoid the embarrassment of saying \"No.\" I heard you wanted to drink some of this? You want to listen to this record? You want to watch TV? You want some ice cream?\n[1963-08-07T22:00:00] Bruno's house | I saw that I suddenly realized it was very late, but Nino and Lina had vanished again. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and it made me very uneasy. Where had they gone? Could they have been locked in Nino's bedroom? Could Lina have lost all sense of measure in this matter too? Maybe... I didn't want to think any further.\n[1963-08-07T22:05:00] Bruno's house | I saw myself standing up and saying to Bruno. I heard, \"It's too late.\"",

    "text": "[1963-08-07T22:05:05] Bruno's House | I saw that he was very polite, but there was still a hint of sadness in his eyes. He spoke in a low voice. I heard, \"Stay a little longer.\"\n[1963-08-07T22:10:00] Bruno's house | I heard that he had to leave very early the next day to attend a family gathering, and he said he wouldn't be back until next Monday. He mentioned that not seeing me for several days would make him feel extremely uneasy.\n[1963-08-07T22:10:05] Bruno's house | I saw him gently take my hand and say he loved me, and other similar words.\n[1963-08-07T22:10:10] Bruno's house | I saw myself gently pulling my hand away, and he didn't try any other physical contact.\n[1963-08-07T22:10:15] Bruno's house | I saw him talking endlessly about his feelings for me. He was usually quiet, but now he wouldn't stop speaking. I couldn't interrupt him.\n[1963-08-07T22:15:00] Bruno's House | I finally got the chance to say, \"I really have to go now.\" At that moment, I raised my voice and shouted. I heard, \"Lina, please, come out, it's already 10:15.\"\n[1963-08-07T22:20:00] Bruno's house downstairs | I had seen them a few minutes later, and they appeared.\n[1963-08-07T22:25:00] Bruno's house downstairs | I saw Nino and Bruno accompanying us as we looked for a motor tricycle, and Bruno said goodbye to us. I thought it was as if he wasn't just going back to San Gregorio Armeno for a few days, but going to America and never coming back.\n[1963-08-07T22:30:00] On the way home | I saw Lina on the way, speaking to me in a flattering tone, as if announcing a major news. I heard \"Nino told me he admires you.\"\n[1963-08-07T22:30:05] On the way home | I saw that I immediately answered her rudely, and I said seriously to Lina. I heard, \"I don't like him at all. What if you got pregnant?\"\n[1963-08-07T22:30:10] On the way home | I saw her say it in my ear. I heard, \"There's no danger. We're just hugging [intimate act].\"  \n\"Ha!\"  \n\"No matter what, I can't [pregnant state].\"  \n\"You were already pregnant once.\"\n[1963-08-07T22:30:15] On the way home | \"I told him I won't [be in a reproductive state]. He knows what to do.\"  \n\"Who is he?\"  \n\"Nino. He'll use a condom.\"\n[1963-08-07T22:30:20] On the way home | \"I heard 'What?'\"\n\"I don't know, that's what he said.\"\n\"You don't even know what it is, and you believed him?\"\n\"It's the thing that's on top.\"\n\"What's it on top of?\"\n[1963-08-07T22:30:25] On the way home | I thought about how I wanted to force her to say the word, how I wanted her to understand that what she'd told me was contradictory. At first, she'd assured me that they were just [intimate], and then she said that Nino would never put her in a [pregnant] state.\n[1963-08-07T22:30:30] On the way home | I thought about how angry I was, I wished she could feel ashamed, but in reality, she was happy about everything that happened.\n[1963-08-07T22:45:00] Renting House | When I got home, she was very friendly with Nunzia, and she emphasized that we had come back early, then went to bed.\n[1963-08-07T23:00:00] Renting house | I saw that she hadn't closed the door. When she saw that I was already ready for bed, she called out to me. I heard, \"Stay here for a while, close the door.\"\n[1963-08-07T23:05:00] Rentals | I saw myself sitting on the edge of the bed, but I was making a great effort to show that I was tired of her and of everything. I heard, \"What do you want to tell me?\"\n[1963-08-07T23:05:05] Rentals | I saw her whisper. I heard, \"I want to sleep with Nino.\"\n[1963-08-07T23:05:10] Renting House | I saw and was so surprised that I stood there in shock. I heard, \"What should be done about Nunzia?\"\n[1963-08-07T23:05:15] Renting House | \"I heard, 'Wait, don't be angry. There's not much time left, Elena. Stefano comes on Saturday, he'll stay here for ten days, and then we have to go back to San Gregorio Armeno. Everything will be over.'\"\n\"What do you mean everything will be over?\"\n\"Exactly these days, these nights...\"\n[1963-08-07T23:10:00] Rentals | I saw that we had discussed it for a long time, and I thought she was very clear-minded.\n[1963-08-07T23:15:00] Rentals | I saw her whisper that such things would never happen again in the future. I thought of her muttering that she loved him, that she wanted to have him.\n[1963-08-07T23:15:05] Renting House | I thought of the verb she used—love. That was a word you could only find in books or movies. In our Mergellina, no one used that word. I only used it when talking to myself. I preferred the word \"like\" instead.\n[1963-08-07T23:20:00] Renting House | I thought she was different. She loved Nino, but she clearly knew that love would be crushed and had to end early. She would do it, starting from Saturday night, she would crush that love. I should believe in her.\n[1963-08-07T23:25:00] Rentals | I thought about it, but in the remaining brief time, she intended to devote herself to Nino.\n[1963-08-07T23:30:00] Rentals | I saw her say it. I heard her say, \"I want to spend the whole day and night in bed with him. I want to sleep in his arms, to be able to do whatever I want with him whenever I want, to touch him however I like, even when he's asleep, and then we'd be done forever.\"\n[1963-08-07T23:30:05] Rentals | I heard, \"It's impossible.\"  \n\"You have to help me.\"  \n\"How can I help you?\"  \n\"You should convince my mother that Nella invited us to spend two days in Barano, and we'll stay there.\"\n[1963-08-07T23:35:00] Rentals | I saw myself silent. I thought she had already made up her mind, that she had a plan. Of course, it might have been something she and Nino came up with together, maybe he had specifically sent Bruno away for this very reason.\n[1963-08-07T23:35:05] Rentals | I wondered who knew when they had started making their plans, perhaps after they had talked about new capitalism, new colonialism, Africa, Latin America, Beckett, and then Russell.\n[1963-08-07T23:35:10] Rentals | I thought that Nino had stopped discussing these issues, and now their minds were only focused on how to use me to fool Nunzia and Stefano.\n[1963-08-07T23:40:00] Rentals | I saw and said angrily. I heard, \"You're completely crazy. If your mother believes it, but your husband will never believe this.\"\n[1963-08-07T23:40:05] Rentals | \"I heard, 'You just need to convince my mother to let us go to Balano. I'll convince her not to tell Stefano about this.'\"\n[1963-08-07T23:40:10] Renting House | I heard, \"I won't agree to it.\"  \n\"Are we no longer friends?\"  \n\"No.\"  \n\"Are you no longer Nino's friend?\"  \n\"No.\"\n[1963-08-07T23:45:00] Renting House | I thought, but Lina was good at pulling me into her affairs, and I couldn't resist.\n[1963-08-07T23:45:05] Renting House | I saw myself saying I didn't want to. I thought, but at the same time, I felt that if I were no longer a part of her life, if I could no longer take part in her whims, I would certainly feel lonely.\n[1963-08-07T23:50:00] Renting House | I thought, fundamentally, wasn't this deception of hers just another one of her usual imaginative and risky approaches?\n[1963-08-07T23:50:05] Renting House | I thought about how we would stand together, facing everyone, and how we would deal with Nunzia's interference the next day. The day after, we would leave early together, and at Mergellina we would part ways—she would go to Bruno and Nino's place, while I would take a boat to Maronti Beach.\n[1963-08-07T23:50:10] Rentals | I thought about how she would be with Nino all day and night, and I would spend the day at Nella's, sleep in Barano that night, and return to Mergellina for lunch the next day, meeting her at Bruno's house and then going home together—a perfect plan.\n[1963-08-07T23:55:00] Rentals | I watched her orchestrating all these small and large matters, planning to carry them out step by step without a single flaw. She embraced me, begging me. I thought about it, and my mind became active again.\n[1963-08-07T23:55:05] Renting House | I thought this was a new adventure, just the two of us, once again trying to seize things life didn't want to give us.",

    "text": "[1963-08-07T23:55:10] Rentals | I thought about whether I wanted her to be unable to experience that joy, making Nino suffer? Or did I want them both to lose their minds, unable to control their desires, swept away by passion, and then fall into danger? I don't know.\n[1963-08-07T23:55:15] Renting House | I thought about that night, about that moment when I realized I had been following her thoughts all along, supporting her adventurous actions—that was an important part of our long friendship, and it was how I showed my love for her. She called it friendship, but I desperately thought of it as love—love for Nino.\n[1963-08-07T23:55:20] Renting House | I said, just as I saw it. I heard, \"Okay, I'll help you.\"\n[1963-08-08T09:00:00] Rentals | I saw the next day, and I told Nunzia those lies that even I felt ashamed of—using Professor Oliviero as an excuse. I thought it was even more shameful that this was my thought, not Lina's.\n[1963-08-08T09:05:00] Rentals | I wondered how bad the situation had been back then when the teacher was living in Potenza.\n[1963-08-08T09:10:00] Rentals | I said to Nunzia. I heard her say, \"Yesterday, I met Elena Incalzi, and she told me about her cousin. Teacher Oliviero is recovering, and she's now staying with Elena, hoping the sea will fully restore her health.\"\n[1963-08-08T09:15:00] Renting House | \"I heard that tomorrow night, Nella was throwing a birthday party for Professor Oliviero and had invited me and Lina. At that time, we were her best students. We really wanted to go, but the party would last until very late, and we couldn't make it. Nella told us that we could stay at her house that night.\"\n[1963-08-08T09:20:00] Renting House | I saw Nunzia frowning and asking me. I heard \"Living in Balano?\"  \n\"Yes, the gathering is there.\"\n[1963-08-08T09:25:00] Rentals | I heard, \"Elena, you go! Lina can't go, her husband will get angry.\" I saw a moment of silence.\n[1963-08-08T09:30:00] Renting House | I saw Lina say that. I heard, \"We won't tell him.\"  \n\"What did you say?\"  \n\"Mama, he's in San Gregorio Armeno, I'm here, he won't find out.\"\n[1963-08-08T09:35:00] Rentals | I heard, \"Whatever you've done, it will eventually be known.\"  \n\"No, it won't.\"  \n\"It will. Enough. Lina, I don't want to talk about this anymore. If Elena wants to go, she can go. You'll have to stay here.\"\n[1963-08-08T10:30:00] Rentals | I saw that we had been entangled like this for more than an hour. I emphasized that the teacher's health condition was very poor, who knew if this was not the last chance to express our gratitude to her.\n[1963-08-08T10:35:00] Renting House | I saw Lina saying it to her mother like that. I heard, \"How many times have you lied to your father? Just be honest. You did it not out of malice, but because you had to do something that was right, yet he wouldn't agree. You must have lied for that.\"\n[1963-08-08T10:40:00] Rentals | I saw her talking and talking, and Nunzia began, saying she had never told a single lie to Fernando, then she admitted she had told one, two... many.\n[1963-08-08T10:45:00] Rentals | I saw her finally shouting at Lina with a tone that mixed her mother's pride and anger. I heard myself say, \"What exactly went wrong when I gave birth to you? Did I hiccup? Cramp? Lose power? The light bulb flicker? Did the basin on the drawer fall to the floor? There must have been some mistake! You were born to be unbearable, different from other girls.\"\n[1963-08-08T10:50:00] Rentals | I saw her, and when she said that, her whole body became very sad, as if her heart had softened.\n[1963-08-08T10:55:00] Renting House | I saw it, but she soon became angry again, saying that it was wrong to lie to her husband just to see a teacher.\n[1963-08-08T11:00:00] Rentals | I saw Lina sigh at this moment. I heard her say, \"The little bit of culture I have now was all taught by this teacher.\"\n[1963-08-08T11:30:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw that Nunzia finally gave in, but she set a specific condition: we had to be back home by two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, not a minute late.\n[1963-08-08T11:35:00] Renting House | \"I heard, 'If Stefano had come earlier and didn't see you, what would have happened? Please, Lina, you mustn't make things hard for me, okay?'\"\n\"Got it.\"\n[1963-08-08T12:00:00] Beach | I saw us going to the beach, Lina was full of joy, she hugged me, kissed me, and said she would owe me for the rest of her life.\n[1963-08-08T12:05:00] Beach | I thought about it, but I already felt guilty because by mentioning Professor Oliviero, I made her the center of the gathering. I imagined her lively and energetic in class, and her situation must have been worse than what I had seen at that time.\n[1963-08-08T12:10:00] Beach | I still remember the scene when she was taken away by ambulance, and it's possible her current condition is even more worrying than what I saw in the hospital.\n[1963-08-08T12:15:00] Beach | The sense of accomplishment from coming up with the excuse quickly disappeared, as did the thrilling tension of conspiring with Lina—I was left with a deep feeling of regret in my heart.\n[1963-08-08T12:20:00] Beach | I thought to myself, why did I help Lina, why did I cover for her infidelity.\n[1963-08-08T12:25:00] Beach | I thought that, fundamentally, Lina wanted to betray her husband, to break the sacred bonds of marriage, to escape from her position as a wife, and to do something crazy, something that would make Stefano smash her head if he found out.\n[1963-08-08T12:30:00] Beach | I thought about how she had suddenly done something to that wedding photo, and I felt sick in my stomach. Now I think, she's still like that, but not toward a photo anymore, but toward Mrs. Carraci herself.\n[1963-08-08T12:35:00] Beach | I thought that in this situation, I was still involved, giving her a hand. Nino was just a tool! Yes, yes, like those scissors, glue, and paints, she used Nino to stir up trouble.\n[1963-08-08T12:40:00] Beach | I thought about how it was her who had driven me to do such a terrible thing, why did I let her lead me around like that?!\n[1963-08-08T12:45:00] Beach | I saw that Nino was waiting for us on the beach. He asked anxiously. I heard, \"How is it going?\"\n[1963-08-08T12:45:05] Beach | I saw her answer. I heard, \"It's done.\"\n[1963-08-08T12:50:00] Beach | I saw the two of them run off to swim, and they didn't even invite me to go with them. I thought, of course, even if they asked me to go, I wouldn't have gone. Because I was very uneasy inside, I felt very cold.\n[1963-08-08T12:50:05] Beach | I thought, even if I went into the water, I would still be afraid it was too deep, and in the end I'd still be left alone on the beach!\n[1963-08-08T13:00:00] Beach | I saw them jump into the water without hesitation, and Lina let out a happy cry. I saw that day had wind, with wisps of clouds in the sky, and the waves were a bit big.\n[1963-08-08T13:05:00] Beach | I thought they were happy, lost in their own story, full of energy because they were about to get what they longed for, willing to pay any price.\n[1963-08-08T13:10:00] Beach | I saw them steadily swimming with their arms, quickly disappearing into the waves.\n[1963-08-08T13:15:00] Beach | I thought about how I felt as if I'd been kidnapped by friendship, a feeling that was unbearable. Everything was so complicated—I was the one who brought Lina to Vomero, I used her to follow Nino, and it was a hopeless pursuit.\n[1963-08-08T13:20:00] Beach | I thought about how I had given up my salary at the bookstore in Majano, in order to get her money. Now I serve her, playing the role of a maid, and I have to help my mistress, covering up her affair.\n[1963-08-08T13:25:00] Beach | I thought about what I had to do for her behavior, I had to help her get Nino, I had to let her take my place and get him, let him—yes, let him, spend a day and a night with him, give him a blowjob.\n[1963-08-08T13:30:00] Beach | I saw my temples pulsing, and I kicked the sand with my heels a couple of times. I thought of the word I'd heard as a child, the one that now echoed in my mind—fuck. It made me imagine all sorts of things, mixed with other sexual fantasies.\n[1963-08-08T13:35:00] Beach | I thought about this, and at that moment, the school disappeared, along with those beautiful sentences in the books, and the Latin and Greek translations vanished from my mind.\n[1963-08-08T13:40:00] Beach | I saw myself staring at the dazzling sea. I saw the endless water surface rising and falling, merging with the sky. Amid the white waves, I could barely make out the figures of Nino and Lina, two small black dots.\n[1963-08-08T13:45:00] Beach | I thought about whether they were swimming forward all along, toward the clouds at sea level, or if they were actually swimming back.\n[1963-08-08T13:50:00] Beach | I thought of my desire for them to drown, for death to take away the joy they would have enjoyed tomorrow.\n[1963-08-08T14:00:00] Beach | I saw and heard someone calling my name, and I immediately turned around to look.\n[1963-08-08T14:00:05] Beach | I heard the words, \"I wasn't wrong, was I?\" in a man's sarcastic voice.  \n\"I told you, it's her,\" a woman's voice said.\n[1963-08-08T14:00:10] Beach | I realized at once that it was Michele and Giggia! I stood up. I knew they had come with Giullara's brother, who was named Rello, a twelve-year-old boy.\n[1963-08-08T14:05:00] Beach | I saw and greeted them happily. I thought, even though I never said: \"Please sit down.\"\n[1963-08-08T14:05:05] Beach | I saw Donato Girola carefully laying out her towel and Michele's towel on the beach, placing his bag, cigarettes, and lighter on top of them. I thought I hoped they would just hurry up and leave, hoped they were rushing off to do something.\n[1963-08-08T14:05:10] Beach | I heard and then said to her brother: You're lying in the hot sand, it's windy now, your swimsuit is wet, you'll catch a cold.\n[1963-08-08T14:05:15] Beach | I thought of a way. I forced myself not to look at the sea, thinking that if I didn't, they wouldn't either.\n[1963-08-08T14:10:00] Beach | I saw that I was pretending to be concerned about Michele, and he began to talk to me in his usual indifferent, careless way.\n[1963-08-08T14:15:00] Beach | I knew they had taken a day off because it was too hot in San Gregorio Armeno, so they came by boat in the morning and left by boat in the evening to get some fresh air.\n[1963-08-08T14:20:00] Beach | I know that in the shop on Martiri Square, there are now Pinocchia and Alfonso Carracci, or rather Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia, because Pinocchia isn't much use, while Alfonso Carracci is very capable.\n[1963-08-08T14:25:00] Beach | I knew they had come to Mergellina because of Pinocchia's advice. Pinocchia had said, \"You'll definitely find them, just follow the beach.\"\n[1963-08-08T14:30:00] Beach | I said to myself several times at that moment, I'm really glad to see you. I know it was really like that. As we walked along, Giggia suddenly called out: \"Isn't that Elena?\"\n[1963-08-08T14:35:00] Beach | I saw Michele, her feet covered in sand, accidentally step on Giggia's towel, and she said something. I heard, \"Be careful!\"\n[1963-08-08T14:40:00] Beach | I thought my efforts had been in vain. Now that they've explained the reason they came, I know what question is coming next. Before they even ask, I've already read it in their eyes:\n[1963-08-08T14:40:05] Beach | I heard, \"Where's Lina?\"  \n\"She's swimming.\"  \n\"Such a big wave, still swimming?\"  \n\"It's not that big, really.\"\n[1963-08-08T14:45:00] Beach | I saw that there was no way to avoid it: he and Giggia turned their heads to look at the sea, which was covered with small white waves.\n[1963-08-08T14:45:05] Beach | I saw they were already sitting on the towels, but I didn't look very carefully.\n[1963-08-08T14:50:00] Beach | I saw Michele arguing with Girolama's brother because the boy still wanted to go swimming.\n[1963-08-08T14:50:05] Beach | I saw and then shoved a comic book into his hands, saying to his girlfriend, \"We'll never bring him again.\" I heard him say to the boy, \"Stay here quietly!\" \"Do you want to drown?\"\n[1963-08-08T14:55:00] Beach | I heard Giggia say to me, \"You look great, your skin is dark and glowing, and your hair is getting even more golden.\"\n[1963-08-08T15:00:00] Beach | I saw myself smiling. I didn't feel giddy at all, the only thing I was thinking was: I should find a way to take them away.\n[1963-08-08T15:05:00] Beach | I said what I saw. I heard, \"You should go home and rest a bit. Nunzia is at home; she'll be very happy to see you.\"\n[1963-08-08T15:10:00] Beach | I saw they all refused. They had to take a motorboat back in two hours, and before leaving, they wanted to sunbathe a bit more.\n[1963-08-08T15:15:00] Beach | I said what I saw. I heard, \"Let's go have a drink at the water bar.\"  \n\"Okay, let's wait for Lina and go together.\"\n[1963-08-08T15:20:00] Beach | I saw myself struggling hard to make conversation, so I started asking a bunch of questions, all the questions I could think of: How was Giyao's father in Capodimonte? I thought that this moment was undoubtedly a very tense one for me.\n[1963-08-08T15:25:00] Beach | I saw what happened to Marcello, did he find a girlfriend? What did Michele think of the new shoes design? What did his father think? What about his mother? What did his grandfather say, and so on.\n[1963-08-08T15:30:00] Beach | I stood up and said, \"I'm going to get Lina.\" I went to the seashore and shouted loudly. I heard, \"Lina! Come back, Michele and Giggia are here.\"\n[1963-08-08T15:35:00] Beach | I saw that it was no use; she hadn't heard my call. I went back and sat on the beach again, then started talking with them again, trying to take their minds off things.\n[1963-08-08T15:40:00] Beach | I thought that when Lina and Nino returned to the shore, they should find Giggia and Michele already there, so they wouldn't have a chance to do something affectionate before seeing it.\n[1963-08-08T15:45:00] Beach | I saw that Bambina was listening to me, but Michele didn't even bother to pretend to pay attention. I thought the reason he came to Vomero was just to meet Lina and talk to her about the new shoes, and I was certain of that.\n[1963-08-08T15:50:00] Beach | I saw him looking at the sea, which grew more and more turbulent.\n[1963-08-08T15:55:00] Beach | I saw that in the end, he saw Lina. She came out of the sea, holding hands with Nino.\n[1963-08-08T15:55:05] Beach | I saw how radiant a pair they were, both tall and elegant, their shoulders touching, smiling at each other. I thought that others could never possibly miss it.\n[1963-08-08T15:55:10] Beach | I thought they were completely absorbed in their own world and had no idea I wasn't alone.\n[1963-08-08T16:00:00] Beach | When I saw Lina looking at Michele, she let go of Nino's hand, but it was already too late.\n[1963-08-08T16:05:00] Beach | I saw Girola, who perhaps had noticed nothing at all; her younger brother was reading a comic book, but Michele saw it. He turned around to look at me, as if seeking confirmation on my face that what had just happened right before his eyes was real.\n[1963-08-08T16:10:00] Beach | I saw that he had noticed my fear, and he spoke in a serious, deliberate, slow tone. I heard, \"Ten minutes, we're just saying hello, then we'll be gone.\"\n[1963-08-08T16:30:00] Beach | I saw that they actually stayed for more than an hour. I introduced him, saying that Nino was a classmate from our primary school, and I emphasized that he was also my high school classmate.",

    "text": "[1963-08-08T16:35:00] Beach | I saw when Michele heard the name Nino, he asked him the most annoying question. I heard, \"You're the son of the person who writes articles on Il Messaggero and the San Gregorio Armeno Evening News?\"\n[1963-08-08T16:40:00] Beach | I saw Nino reluctantly nod, and Michele looked at him for a while, as if trying to find that blood relation in his eyes. Finally, he stopped talking to Nino and only spoke to Lina.\n[1963-08-08T16:45:00] Beach | I saw that Lina was polite, but her words often had a sharp edge, and sometimes they were even cruel. Michele said to her. I heard, \"Your brother brags that all the new shoe designs were his idea.\"\n[1963-08-08T16:45:05] Beach | I heard, \"That's the truth.\"  \n\"So all those shoes are trash.\"  \n\"You'll see, these scraps will sell better than the previous ones.\"\n[1963-08-08T16:45:10] Beach | \"I heard, 'It's possible, but it'll sell better if you come to the store.'\"  \n\"There's already Jiyao there; she's selling well enough.\"\n[1963-08-08T16:45:15] Beach | I heard, \"Jiyao will help me in Capodimonte.\"  \n\"That's your problem. I'll be running the store in Capodimonte.\"\n[1963-08-08T16:45:20] Beach | \"I heard, 'Madam, look, if you come to Martirini Square, that's a winning card.'\"  \n\"Winning or not, you can forget it. I'll stay where I belong.\"\n[1963-08-08T16:50:00] Beach | I saw that they always spoke in this way. I thought it was like playing a game of kicking the ball.\n[1963-08-08T16:55:00] Beach | I saw myself and Jiyao occasionally trying to interject, especially Jiyao, who was unusually angry. I thought about how, when her boyfriend talked about her future, he never once asked her.\n[1963-08-08T17:00:00] Beach | I thought about Nino—what I noticed was that he was stunned, or perhaps he was admiring how Lina could so effortlessly handle Michele, how she could match him word for word in the dialect, standing her ground without yielding an inch.\n[1963-08-08T17:30:00] Beach | I saw the young man from the Solara family give up at last; they were leaving, and their parasols and other things were all far away.\n[1963-08-08T17:35:00] Beach | I saw him say goodbye to me, then greet Lina warmly, once again reminding her to wait for her to come to the store in September.\n[1963-08-08T17:35:05] Beach | I saw him speak to Nino very seriously, like ordering a subordinate to buy a pack of cigarettes. I heard, \"Tell your father that he wrote in his article that he doesn't like the store's decoration, and he was wrong. He took the money, so he should have written that everything in the store is great; otherwise, he won't see the money.\"\n[1963-08-08T17:40:00] Beach | I was surprised to see Nino, a bit flustered, and he didn't answer. I thought maybe it was because of the humiliation.\n[1963-08-08T17:45:00] Beach | I saw Geyao holding Michele's hand, and he let her hold it somewhat mechanically. The two of them walked away, followed by Geyao's younger brother, who was still looking at his comic book as he walked.\n[1963-08-08T17:50:00] Beach | I thought about how angry and scared I was, and I wasn't satisfied with what I had done or said.\n[1963-08-08T17:55:00] Beach | As soon as Michele and Giggia left, I said to Lina, and I made sure Nino heard it too. I heard, \"He saw you.\"\n[1963-08-08T18:00:00] Beach | I saw Nino looking a bit embarrassed as he asked. I heard \"Who is he?\"  \n\"A conceited member of the Camorra, just a pile of dog shit,\" Lina said with a look of contempt on her face.\n[1963-08-08T18:05:00] Beach | I added immediately—Nino should also know. I heard, \"He's her husband's partner; he'll tell Stefano everything he saw today.\"\n[1963-08-08T18:10:00] Beach | I saw Lina deny it. I heard, \"What happened? There's nothing to talk about.\"  \n\"You know very well they'll betray us.\"\n[1963-08-08T18:15:00] Beach | \"I heard, 'Is that so? Who the hell cares. Forget it. If you don't want to help me, let whatever is going to happen happen.'\"\n[1963-08-08T18:20:00] Beach | I saw her discussing the next day's plans with Nino, regardless of whether I was there or not. I thought of it like when she got a boost after meeting Michele, while Nino was like a toy about to run out of batteries.\n[1963-08-08T18:25:00] Beach | I saw him mutter something. I heard, \"Are you sure you won't get into trouble because of me?\"\n[1963-08-08T18:25:05] Beach | I saw Lina run her hand along his cheek and say. I heard, \"You don't want to come?\"\n[1963-08-08T18:25:10] Beach | I heard, \"I'm just worried about you.\" I thought about that touch, which seemed to awaken him again.\n[1963-08-08T18:30:00] On the way home | I saw that we soon said goodbye to Nino and went home.\n[1963-08-08T18:35:00] On the way home | I saw her on the road and told her about some terrible scenarios that might happen. I heard, \"Tonight, Michele will definitely talk to Stefano about this. Stefano might come tomorrow morning. If he doesn't find you at home, Nunzia will tell him to go look for you in Barano. But he won't find you there either. You'll lose everything.\"\n[1963-08-08T18:40:00] On the way home | I heard, \"Lina, listen to me, this way you'll not only ruin yourself but also ruin me. My mom will kill me.\"\n[1963-08-08T18:45:00] On the way home | I saw her, but she was just listening to me absentmindedly, smiling and saying something like that. I heard myself say, \"I love you, Elena, I will always love you, but I hope that in your life, you will at least once feel the way I feel right now.\"\n[1963-08-08T18:50:00] On the way home | I thought to myself at that moment: You deserve it!\n[1963-08-08T20:00:00] Renting House | I saw that we didn't go out that night. Lina was very gentle with her mother, wanting to cook by herself, serve the food, clear the table, and do the dishes.\n[1963-08-08T21:00:00] Renting House | I saw that in the end, she was still very close to her mother, sitting on her knees, hugging her neck, pressing her forehead against her mother's. I suddenly felt very sad.\n[1963-08-08T21:10:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia should be very embarrassed, and then she suddenly started crying, her eyes full of tears. I thought she wasn't very used to her daughter's familiarity.\n[1963-08-08T21:15:00] Renting house | I saw her say something that stirred a mix of emotions in the midst of her anxiety. I heard, \"Please, Lina, no one else has a daughter like you. Don't make me sad.\"\n[1963-08-08T21:20:00] Rentals | I saw Lina gently tease her mother and then accompany her to her room.\n[1963-08-09T08:00:00] Renting House | I saw that it was Lina who came to wake me up the next morning. I thought about it and felt extremely painful, didn't want to get up and carry out that damn plan.\n[1963-08-09T08:30:00] On the way to Mergellina | I saw an electric tricycle take us to Mergellina, and I told her about the terrible scenarios that might happen, but she didn't care at all. What if Nella wasn't there? What if there really were guests in the house and there was no place for me to stay? What if Nino's family decided to come to Mergellina to see their son?\n[1963-08-09T08:35:00] On the way to Mergellina | I always saw her answers as a joke. I heard, \"If Nella weren't here, Nino's mother would have welcomed you; if you had nowhere to stay, come back and live with us; if Nino's whole family came to Bruno's house, we wouldn't open the door even if they knocked...\"\n[1963-08-09T08:50:00] Mergellina | I saw that we had been talking all along, and it wasn't even nine o'clock yet—we had already reached our destination.\n[1963-08-09T08:55:00] Mergellina | I saw Nino already waiting by the window, he ran to open the door.\n[1963-08-09T09:00:00] Mergellina | I saw him just greet me, then pull Lina inside the door.\n[1963-08-09T09:05:00] Mergellina | I thought that everything could still be salvaged before reaching the gate of this house, but after that, everything was irreversible.\n[1963-08-09T09:10:00] On the way to Balano | I saw Lina pay, and I stayed in the same rickshaw to go directly to Balano. I thought about how, on the way, I realized I really couldn't hate them.\n[1963-08-09T09:15:00] On the way to Barano | I thought that although I felt resentment toward Nino and jealousy toward Lila, even wishing both of them dead, I still longed for a miracle to happen, so that all three of us would remain safe.\n[1963-08-09T09:20:00] On the way to Balano | I thought about how I always went along with them. I realized my feelings toward them weren't hatred—I hated myself, I looked down on myself.\n[1963-08-09T09:25:00] On the way to Balano | I saw that on the island, when the electric tricycle started moving, the wind blew against my body, bringing the scent of grass and trees from the early morning. I thought about it, but I was in a bad mood.\n[1963-08-09T09:30:00] On the way to Balano | I thought about how I could feel their emotions deep within my heart. I couldn't help but imagine them embracing each other in the empty house, their passion overwhelming me and making me feel very uneasy.\n[1963-08-09T09:35:00] On the way to Balano | I realized that I love both of them, and because of that, I can't love myself. I can't feel my own feelings, and I'm unable to express my own needs with the same blind strength they have.",

    "text": "[1963-08-09T09:40:00] On the way to Barano | I thought that was how I felt at that time.\n[1963-08-09T10:30:00] Elena's house | I arrived at Nella's house, as usual, and was warmly welcomed by Nella and the Nino family. I thought of the sweetest face I could make—the one my father used when taking tips, the expression of my ancestors when they wanted to avoid danger. They always looked so frightened, so humble, so likable.\n[1963-08-09T10:35:00] Elena's house | I saw myself, using a fawning tone, saying one lie after another. I heard myself say, \"There are guests at Karrachi's house, I didn't have anywhere to stay that night.\"\n[1963-08-09T10:35:05] Elena's house | \"I hope it's not too forward of me to come here like this, so suddenly. If it's inconvenient, I'll just go back to San Gregorio Armeno for a few days.\"\n[1963-08-09T10:40:00] Elena's house | I saw Nella embracing me. I heard her say again and again that it would be a great happiness for her if I went to see her.\n[1963-08-09T11:00:00] Elena's house | I saw that I hadn't gone to the beach with Nino's family, even though several children were protesting, insisting that I go with them, and Lila was also urging me to find them soon. Donato said he would wait for me to go into the sea together.\n[1963-08-09T12:00:00] Elena's house | I saw myself staying at home with Lila, helping her tidy up the house and make lunch. I thought of lies, the scene of their affair, my own complicity in covering for them, and an indescribable jealousy—all of it swept me up.\n[1963-08-09T12:05:00] Elena's house | I thought about how I envied Lina for giving herself to Nino, and I also envied Nino for having taken Lina.\n[1963-08-09T12:10:00] Elena's house | I thought that suddenly, I felt less burdened, and I thought Nira seemed to have fewer prejudices against the Nino family.\n[1963-08-09T12:15:00] Elena's house | I heard her say that she and her husband had apparently found a balance, and now that their relationship had improved, they didn't bother her as much.\n[1963-08-09T12:20:00] Elena's house | I saw her and she told me about Professor Oliviero: she had called the teacher to inform her that I was coming to visit her. She felt that Professor Oliviero was weaker than before, but more optimistic.\n[1963-08-09T12:25:00] Elena's house | I saw that, in the end, we exchanged some information calmly, but before we could say much, the conversation drifted off track. I thought again about the weight of my situation at that time.\n[1963-08-09T12:30:00] Elena's house | \"I heard her praising you constantly,\" Nella said when talking about Professor Oliviero. \"But when she found out you came to see me with two married friends, she asked me a lot of questions, especially about Mrs. Lina.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:05] Elena's house | \"I heard 'What did she say?'\"\n\"She said that after teaching for so many years, she had never met such a smart student.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:10] Elena's house | \"I saw 'It's true.' I admitted.\" I was uneasy thinking about Lina's previous excellence.\n[1963-08-09T12:30:15] Elena's house | I saw Donatella make a disapproving face, and I also saw that in her eyes. \"I heard her say, 'My cousin is a good teacher,' but I think she was wrong this time.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:20] Elena's house | I heard, \"No, she's right.\"  \n\"Can I tell you my thoughts?\"  \n\"Of course.\"  \n\"Do you think you'll be upset if I say it?\"  \n\"No, I won't be.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:25] Elena's house | \"I don't like Mrs. Lina, you're much better, you're more beautiful and smarter than her. I've also told Mr. and Mrs. Nino how I feel, and they agree with me.\"  \n\"You say that because you love me.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:30] Elena's house | \"I heard, 'It's not like that, be careful, Elena! I know you two are very close, my aunt told me. I don't want to talk about things that don't concern me, but I can see through a person at a glance. Mrs. Lina knows you're better than her, so she isn't as sincere with you as you are with her.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:35] Elena's house | I saw myself smiling, and I made a face of doubt as I asked. I heard, \"Do you think she would harm me?\"  \n\"I don't know. But she's a scheming woman, you can tell just by looking at her face—just look at her forehead and eyes and you'll see.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:30:40] Elena's house | I saw myself shaking my head, suppressing the joy inside me. I thought! If things had always been so clear and straightforward, that would have been nice, but I already know—though it's different from what I know now—that everything between us is going to be much more complicated.\n[1963-08-09T12:35:00] Elena's house | I saw that I had made a joke, I laughed, and Nella also laughed, I said to her. I heard that Lina always makes a bad first impression. From a young age, she was like a little devil, and she really was that way, but she didn't mean any harm. Her mind was very sharp, and whatever she did, she always did it well.\n[1963-08-09T12:35:05] Elena's house | I heard, \"If she had the chance to study, she would have become a great scientist like Marie Curie, or a novelist like Grazia Deledda, or even someone like Nilda Iotti—the lover of Togliatti.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:35:10] Elena's house | I saw Elena let out a sigh, then jokingly made the sign of the cross on her chest. I heard \"Oh my God!\" I thought about when I heard the last two names.\n[1963-08-09T12:40:00] Elena's house | I saw her smile slightly, and then she remembered something else, something she wanted to whisper in my ear. I knew it was Nino speaking, according to his view, Lina was an almost ugly beauty, the kind of woman who would mesmerize men but also scare them.\n[1963-08-09T12:40:05] Elena's house | I heard \"Why would I be afraid?\" I asked in a low voice.  \nShe answered in an even lower voice: \"Men worry about their thing not working, getting soft, or being cut off with a knife.\"\n[1963-08-09T12:40:10] Elena's house | I saw her laughing, her chest shaking with each laugh, even tears came to her eyes. I couldn't control myself and ended up laughing along with her. I felt uncomfortable, a feeling I had never experienced before. This was not my mother's laugh, nor the lecherous laugh of a woman who understood the ways of men and women. Lila's laughter was mixed with innocence and crudeness, a laugh of an old maid.\n[1963-08-09T12:40:15] Elena's house | I thought she was a good woman, and I wondered why she would laugh at such a thing. At that moment, I also saw my old self, with that same pale and malicious feeling in my chest. I thought: I might one day laugh like her.\n[1963-08-09T13:30:00] Elena's house | I saw that when it was lunchtime, the Nino family had all returned. I saw that they had left a lot of sand on the floor, along with the smell of seawater and sweat.\n[1963-08-09T13:35:00] Elena's house | I saw them scold me in a cheerful tone, making several children wait for me all morning in vain.\n[1963-08-09T14:30:00] Elena's house | I saw myself setting the plates, then clearing the table after eating, washing the dishes, and finally following Pino, Clelia, and Ciro out.\n[1963-08-09T14:40:00] By the Reed Clump | I saw myself walking with them to the reed field, and I helped them cut a reed to make a kite.\n[1963-08-09T15:00:00] By the reed cluster | I thought about being with the children, and I felt at ease.\n[1963-08-09T16:00:00] Elena's house | When I saw their parents resting and Nella dozing on the lounge chair on the balcony, time flew by quickly, and I was completely absorbed in making the kite. I had never thought about Nino and Lina.\n[1963-08-09T17:00:00] Beach | I saw that in the late afternoon, we went to the beach together, and Nella also came, she was there to fly a kite.\n[1963-08-09T17:10:00] Beach | I saw myself running back and forth on the beach, followed by three children. I saw them all gaping in astonishment as the kite was about to take flight.\n[1963-08-09T17:15:00] Beach | I saw it, but when they saw the kite spin a few times and then unexpectedly fall onto the beach, they would shout in surprise.\n[1963-08-09T17:30:00] Beach | I saw I had tried many times, but I just couldn't get the kite to fly, even though Donato was shouting at me from under the umbrella, telling me what to do.\n[1963-08-09T17:40:00] Beach | I finally gave up, drenched in sweat, and said to Pinocchio, Clelia, and Ciro. I heard, \"Let your father go.\"\n[1963-08-09T17:45:00] Beach | I saw a few kids pull Nino over. He looked at the bamboo frame of the kite, the sky-blue paper, and the kite string. He studied the wind direction.\n[1963-08-09T17:50:00] Beach | I saw it and started running backward, even though my body felt heavy, he was full of energy, jumping and moving forward.\n[1963-08-09T17:55:00] Beach | I saw a few children running beside him, full of joy, and I too regained my energy, running after them. I thought that in the end, I was also infected by their happiness.\n[1963-08-09T18:00:00] Beach | I saw our kite flying higher and higher, already up in the sky. There was no need to run anymore; we just needed to hold the line. Either Silvio, Clarissa, or Pino could let it go, of course I could too.\n[1963-08-09T18:30:00] Beach | I saw that later Nino handed me the kite string, but he stayed behind me, and I could feel his breath on my neck as he said. I heard, \"Then pull it, let go.\"\n[1963-08-09T19:00:00] Beach | I saw that it later got dark.",

As I thought about this, all the events that had happened during the day and night suddenly rushed to my mind.\n[1963-08-09T22:10:00] Malongti Beach | I saw myself tiptoeing quietly out and arriving at the Maronti Beach.\n[1963-08-09T22:15:00] Malongdi Beach | I wondered whether Michele had told anyone what he saw, whether things were proceeding as they should, and whether Nunzia was already asleep in the house on Via Gualtiero.\n[1963-08-09T22:20:00] Maronti Beach | I thought or maybe Stefano had already arrived on the island by the last motorboat, and not seeing his wife, he was furious, while Nunzia was trying to calm her son-in-law. I didn't know if Lina had called her husband to make sure he was at San Gregorio Armeno, in the house far away at Mergellina.\n[1963-08-09T22:25:00] Malongti Beach | I thought of Lina now with Nino, those secret lovers without any fear, enjoying their evening.\n[1963-08-09T22:30:00] Malongti Beach | I thought about how everything in this world is uncertain, full of risks. Those who refuse to accept risk, those who don't understand fate, are gradually withering away in the corners.\n[1963-08-09T22:35:00] Malongti Beach | I thought about how I suddenly understood why I couldn't have Nino, while Lila could.\n[1963-08-09T22:40:00] Malongti Beach | I thought about how I couldn't follow those real feelings, how I couldn't make myself break free from convention and tradition. I didn't have Lina's intense emotions; she could enjoy that one night without thinking of anything else.\n[1963-08-09T22:45:00] Malongti Beach | I thought about how I was always left behind, always waiting, while she would always go after what she wanted, what excited her. She did everything possible, never fearing people's contempt, mockery, and abuse, nor did she fear being beaten.\n[1963-08-09T22:50:00] Malongdi Beach | I thought that in the end, she should have Nino, because she believed she loved him, which meant she could take him for herself instead of waiting for him to take action.\n[1963-08-09T23:00:00] Malonti Beach | I saw myself walking down the slope alone in the darkness. I saw a moon appear between the sparse clouds, the night was very fragrant, and I could hear the intoxicating sound of the waves.\n[1963-08-09T23:05:00] Malonto Beach | I saw that on the beach, I took off my shoes. I felt the sand was cold, and what met my eyes was the sea surface, shimmering with glints of blue-gray light.\n[1963-08-09T23:10:00] Malonto Beach | I thought to myself: Yes, Lina was right, the beauty of things is an illusion. The sky is a terrifying expanse. I'm alive, and just ten steps away from me is the sea. That's not beautiful at all—it's a terrifying sight.\n[1963-08-09T23:15:00] Malongti Beach | I thought about how I was part of this beach, this sea, a member of the bustling multitude of things—an overwhelming cosmic terror; at that moment, I was an infinitesimal molecule, through which I became aware of my fear of everything.\n[1963-08-09T23:20:00] Malongti Beach | I saw myself listening to the sound of the sea. I saw and felt the coldness and dampness of the sand.\n[1963-08-09T23:25:00] Malonto Beach | I thought about the entire Vomero, imagining Nino and Lina's bodies entwined, and Stefano alone in their new house—the house that was no longer so new.\n[1963-08-09T23:30:00] Malonto Beach | I thought about how they indulged in wild revelry today, just to nourish tomorrow's violence.\n[1963-08-09T23:35:00] Malonto Beach | I thought, this is real, I'm so scared, I wish this would end as soon as possible. I'm afraid those nightmare-like people will devour my soul.\n[1963-08-09T23:40:00] Malongti Beach | I thought of a horde of wild dogs, poisonous snakes, scorpions, and giant water snakes surging out from the darkness.\n[1963-08-09T23:45:00] Malonto Beach | I thought of how I longed to be sitting here on the shore, and from the darkness, some killers would emerge and cut me to pieces.\n[1963-08-09T23:50:00] Malongdi Beach | Yes, yes, I deserve this punishment because I did what I shouldn't have done; I'm just unlucky.\n[1963-08-09T23:55:00] Malongti Beach | I thought of something extremely disturbing, something that would prevent me from passing the night, or the next day, or every day and every hour to come in peace. The more time passed, the more I would feel out of place. That's what I was thinking at the time—thoughts of a very depressed girl.\n[1963-08-10T00:00:00] Malongti Beach | I didn't know how long I had been there, and I heard someone calling me: \"Elena.\" I saw and felt a cold finger touch my shoulder.\n[1963-08-10T00:00:05] Malongti Beach | I saw it and was startled, my heart gave a jump. I immediately turned around and recognized Donato Nino. I thought my breathing grew rapid, as if he were the magical potion from an epic, the kind that can bring the dead back to life.\n[1963-08-10T00:05:00] Malonto Beach | I saw Donato tell me that Nella had woken up and noticed I wasn't at home; she was worried, and Lydia was a little concerned too, so he went to look for me.\n[1963-08-10T00:10:00] Malongdi Beach | I heard him assure the two women, saying, \"Go to sleep. She must have gone to the beach to look at the moon.\" I thought he was the only one who felt it was perfectly normal that I wasn't at home.\n[1963-08-10T00:15:00] Malongti Beach | I saw her, but out of caution and to satisfy the two women's request, he came out to take a look. I thought the same thing, I was sitting on the beach listening to the sea's breath, gazing at the sacred and beautiful sky.\n[1963-08-10T00:20:00] Malongti Beach | I saw him saying something almost like that, and then he sat down beside me. I heard him whisper that he knew me as well as he knew himself, that we were equally sensitive to these beautiful things, that we both appreciated beauty and needed to find the right words to express how beautiful and gentle the night was, how charming the moon was, how the sea shimmered with ripples, as if two animals met in the darkness, in the fragrant evening breeze, and recognized each other.\n[1963-08-10T00:25:00] Malongti Beach | I thought, when he spoke, I clearly felt his voice was artificial and ridiculous, his poetry so clumsy, and beneath his passionate words lay an obvious desire to take me down.\n[1963-08-10T00:30:00] Malongdi Beach | I thought, but I wanted to say: Maybe we really are the same, maybe we were really destined to be so vulgar.\n[1963-08-10T00:35:00] Malongti Beach | I saw myself resting my head on his shoulder, and he immediately wrapped one arm around my waist, slowly pulling me toward him. I heard her say, \"I'm a little cold.\"  \nShe asked if I was feeling better.  \nI answered, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-08-10T00:40:00] Malongti Beach | I saw it like a sigh, and Nino lifted my chin with his index finger and thumb, gently pressing his lips to mine. I heard him say, \"How about this?\"\n[1963-08-10T00:45:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw him moving against me, more and more intensely. I heard and then asked in a low voice, \"Like this, like this? Are you still cold? Are you feeling better?\"\n[1963-08-10T00:50:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw the [intimate act] lasting longer and longer, his tongue brushing against mine, pressing against it, slipping deep into my mouth. I saw and felt his lips were hot and wet, going deeper and deeper into my mouth.\n[1963-08-10T00:55:00] Malongti Beach | I thought I felt much better, I was full of energy again. The cold was retreating, fading away, and I had forgotten my fear.",

    "text": "[1963-08-10T01:00:00] Malonto Beach | I saw his hands removing my coldness, slowly, carefully peeling it away layer by layer without damaging its integrity. I thought the cold had many layers, each very thin, and Nino was very skillful.\n[1963-08-10T01:05:00] Malongti Beach | I thought about his mouth, which was also skillful. He knew my body better than Antonio did, even better than I knew myself. Antonio might never know so much.\n[1963-08-10T01:10:00] Malonto Beach | I saw layer after layer, the hidden self had nowhere to hide and shamelessly exposed itself. Nino knew how to prevent that self from shyly retreating; he knew how to make it stay. I realized that I had a hidden self, whose fingers, lips, teeth, and tongue could uncover her.\n[1963-08-10T01:15:00] Malonti Beach | I saw that the ultimate purpose of his tender gestures, those gentle and sometimes urgent caresses, was this. I thought that throughout the whole process, I had never regretted anything. I let it happen without hesitation, and it felt completely natural. I hoped that's exactly how it would happen.\n[1963-08-10T01:20:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw that perhaps, Nino later forgot his elaborate words. I thought this was a kind of release for me; he was different from Antonio, he didn't want my involvement, he didn't pull my hand toward him so I could touch him.\n[1963-08-10T01:25:00] Malonto Beach | I saw him pouring his passion into my body with great care, and he was proud, wanting to show that he knew women very well. I heard him say that he loved everything about me.\n[1963-08-10T01:30:00] Malonto Beach | I thought he didn't even ask me if you were a virgin, probably because he was already certain of my situation, completely sure of himself.\n[1963-08-10T01:35:00] Malongti Beach | I thought I was feeling a longing and a pleasure, a complete sense of losing myself, so that I didn't just forget where I was, but everything around me, even his body— in my eyes he was so old, I had forgotten all the labels I had given him— Nino's father, Donato, a railway worker, a poet and a journalist.\n[1963-08-10T01:40:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw that he had realized my longing, and he entered me. I thought about how I felt him start off gently, then deliver a sudden, decisive blow that made my abdomen feel as if it were being torn apart.\n[1963-08-10T01:45:00] Malongdi Beach | I felt that pain, but it was soon erased by a rhythmic undulating motion, a collision and friction, emptying and filling me again, along with a passionate desire surging through me.\n[1963-08-10T01:50:00] Malongti Beach | I watched until the end, when he suddenly pulled away and collapsed onto the sand, letting out a groan.\n[1963-08-10T02:00:00] Malongti Beach | I saw that we stayed silent for a while. I thought of the sea, and the terrifying sky, which made me feel completely lost.\n[1963-08-10T02:05:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw Nino starting up his clumsy sentimentality again. I thought about how he believed his sweet words had made me yield to him, but in reality, I could only tolerate two of his sentences at most.\n[1963-08-10T02:10:00] Malonto Beach | I saw myself suddenly stand up, shaking the sand out of my hair and off my body. I straightened my clothes, and at that moment, he actually had the nerve to say. I heard, \"Where shall we meet tomorrow?\"\n[1963-08-10T02:15:00] Malongdi Beach | I saw myself speaking in Italian, with an earnest and resolute tone. I heard, \"He shouldn't have asked that, he shouldn't have come looking for me, not by the sea, not at Mergellina.\"\n[1963-08-10T02:20:00] Malongti Beach | I saw him give a skeptical smile, and I told him Antonio—Antonio, what Melina's son would do, and Michele was even worse. I knew him well; all I had to do was say a word, and he'd get what was coming to him. I heard myself say to him, \"Michele is already eager to beat him up because he took the money but didn't write anything good about the shop on Martiri Square.\"\n[1963-08-10T02:30:00] On the way home | I realized that all along the way, I had been threatening him, making sure he understood my stance and wouldn't speak to me like that again. I thought about my tone, which surprised even me. I had always been used to saying those threatening things in dialect, but now I could say them in Italian too, and it worked very well.\n[1963-08-10T20:00:00] Renting House | I saw that Stefano came at his usual time, and the three of us pretended to be happy, welcoming him. I thought he was very polite, but also a bit uneasy, as if something troubling was hidden beneath his gentle face.\n[1963-08-10T20:05:00] Rentals | I knew that from that day on, his vacation had begun. I thought about it, but I found it strange because he didn't have any luggage.\n[1963-08-10T20:10:00] Renting House | I saw that Lina seemed not to have noticed it, but Nunzia asked. \"I heard 'Sandro! You seem a bit out of it. Do you have something on your mind? Is your mother okay? What about Pinocchia? How's the shoe situation? What did Solara say? Are they satisfied?\"\n[1963-08-10T20:30:00] Renting House | I saw him say that everything was normal, and we had dinner. I saw it, but throughout the entire evening no one said much.\n[1963-08-10T20:40:00] Renting House | At first, Lina tried to act as if she was in a good mood, but when Stefano answered her with single-syllable words and kept a cold attitude, she got angry and stopped talking.\n[1963-08-10T20:50:00] Renting House | I saw that only I and Nunzia were trying every way possible to avoid an awkward silence. I thought, but the awkward silence had already become inevitable.\n[1963-08-10T21:00:00] Renting House | I didn't see him smile until we were eating fruit, when he finally smiled at his wife. I heard, \"Are you swimming with Nino's son?\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:05] Rentals | I heard, \"A few times. What's wrong?\" I thought I was suffocating, and Lina impatiently replied.\n[1963-08-10T21:00:10] Apartment for Rent | \"I heard, 'How many times? Once? Twice? Three times? Five times? How many times in total? Elena, do you know?'\"\n\"Once,\" I answered, \"a couple of days ago he came to see me, and we swam together.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:15] Renting House | I saw a faint smile still on Stefano's face, then I said to his wife. I heard, \"You're so close to Nino's son, when you came back from swimming, you were holding hands?\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:20] Renting house | I saw Lina staring at his face, looking into his eyes and asking. I heard, \"Who told you?\"  \n\"Pinocchio.\"  \n\"Who told Pinocchio?\"  \n\"Giovanna.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:25] Rentals | I heard, \"Who told Giyao la?\"  \n\"Giyao la saw it with her own eyes! She came with Michele, and they're looking for you. You weren't swimming in the water with that bastard and Elena, you two were swimming alone.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:30] Rentals | I saw Lina stand up and speak calmly. I heard, \"I'm going out for a bit, I'll take a walk.\"  \n\"Don't go anywhere! Sit here and answer my questions.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:35] Renting house | I saw Lina standing there, and she had an obvious look of annoyance on her face. Suddenly, she spoke in Italian. I thought of it, but I could sense that it was a kind of contempt.\n[1963-08-10T21:00:40] Rentals | \"I can't believe I married you, you're absolutely worthless. You know Michele wants me to work at his shop. You know, because of that, if Giggia could kill me, she wouldn't hesitate. What are you going to do? Do you believe her? I don't want to hear anything else from you. You're just a puppet, controlled by others. Elena, will you come with me?\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:45] Renting House | I saw her heading for the door, and I was about to get up, but Stefano suddenly jumped up and grabbed her arm, saying something to her. I heard, \"You're not going anywhere. Tell me, did you swim alone with Nino's son? Did you hold his hand?\"",

    "text": "[1963-08-10T21:00:50] Renting house | I saw Lina trying to shake him off, but she couldn't. She said it angrily. I heard, \"Let me go, you really disgust me.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:00:55] Renting House | I saw Nunzia come over too. She scolded her daughter a bit, saying that Lina shouldn't have spoken to Stefano that way. But soon, she switched to an astonishingly loud tone, almost shouting at her son-in-law not to act like that anymore. I heard that Lina had already answered him, and Giggia was just saying that out of jealousy.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:00] Renting House | I heard that the pastry chef's daughter has ill intentions. She's worried about losing her position at the shop in Piazza Martiri. She wants to drive Pinocchia away so she can be the only one in charge. She doesn't know anything about shoes, and she doesn't know how to make pastries—everything is due to Lina, including the new successful business. So, Lina's daughter shouldn't be treated like this.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:05] Rentals | I saw that, in short, she said all that in one breath. I saw that she was really angry, her eyes wide open, and later she couldn't catch her breath.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:10] Renting House | I saw but Stefano didn't hear a single word. Before his mother-in-law had even finished speaking, he had already dragged Lina into the kitchen and was shouting at her. I heard, \"Now answer me, right now.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:01:15] Rentals | I heard Lina cursing him with some terrible words, she was pulling at the cabinet door in resistance, and he pulled so hard that the door came off its hinges. I saw the cabinet leaning sideways, swaying violently, and the plates and cups inside were shaking wildly.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:20] Rentals | I saw Lina being dragged out of the kitchen as if she were flying, her body slamming against the wall in the hallway before being pulled into the bedroom.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:25] Renting House | I saw, in an instant, her husband grab her and hold her arm, as if she were a cup with a handle, and throw her onto the bed, then slam the door behind him heavily.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:30] Rentals | I saw and heard the sound of the key turning in the lock. I thought of that sound, which frightened me. In those long moments, I actually saw the soul of Stefano's father living inside his body, truly the ghost of Don Achille, making the veins on his neck swell and covering his forehead with blue lines.\n[1963-08-10T21:01:35] Apartment for Rent | I saw that although I was very scared, I felt I couldn't just sit there. I grabbed the door handle and shook it. I pounded on the wooden door, begging. I heard, \"Stefano, please! This isn't true, let her go. Stefano, don't hurt her.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:01:40] Renting House | I saw him, but he was already completely lost in his anger. I heard him shouting that he wanted to know the truth because Lina wasn't speaking. I thought of something worse: it sounded like she wasn't even in the room. For a while, I thought he was talking to himself, slapping his own face, breaking things.\n[1963-08-10T21:02:00] Rentals | I saw myself running down the stairs and said to Nunzia. I heard, \"I'll go get the landlord.\" I thought about asking the landlord if he had another key, or maybe finding the landlord's nephew, a strong man who might be able to break the door open.\n[1963-08-10T21:02:05] Apartment rental downstairs | I saw, but it was all in vain. I knocked on the door for a while, but the landlord wasn't there. I thought that if she were here, she wouldn't have opened the door either.\n[1963-08-10T21:02:10] Apartment rental downstairs | At that moment, Stefano's scream was so loud it seemed to break through the walls, reaching the street, the reeds, and even the sea beyond. I saw, but it seemed no one else heard his cries, because no one nearby stuck their head out, and no one noticed.\n[1963-08-10T21:02:15] Renting House | I could only hear Nunzia's plea, which was quieter than Stefano's voice. She threatened that if Stefano hit her daughter, she would tell Fernando and Rino, who would really kill him.\n[1963-08-10T21:03:00] Rentals | I saw myself running back, but didn't know what to do. I threw my entire body weight against the door. I heard myself say that I had called the police, that they were coming right away.\n[1963-08-10T21:03:05] Renting House | I saw that Lina hadn't said a word, so I kept shouting. I heard, \"Lina, are you okay? Please, Lina, tell me how you're doing.\"\n[1963-08-10T21:03:10] Renting house | I realized then that we finally heard her voice, but she wasn't speaking to us—she was coldly addressing her husband. I heard, \"Do you want to know the truth? Yes, I held hands with Nino's son and went swimming. We swam out to deep water, and we [intimate act], touching each other. Yes, I let him do it a hundred times, so I found out you're just a piece of dog shit, worthless, all you want are those disgusting things, it really makes me want to throw up. How's that? Are you happy now?\"\n[1963-08-10T21:03:15] Apartment for Rent | I saw that after Lina spoke, Stefano said nothing more. I stopped banging on the door, and Nunzia stopped crying. I saw silence, only silence, and outside sounds became clear—cars passing by, distant voices, even the sound of a hen flapping its wings.\n[1963-08-10T21:05:00] Rentals | I saw that after a few minutes, Stefano started speaking, but his voice was low, and we could hardly hear what he was saying. I heard him say a few broken, short sentences: \"Let me see how you're doing.\" \"Be good, don't act like this.\" I thought I understood that he was trying to calm himself down.\n[1963-08-10T21:05:05] Rentals | I thought about Lina's confession, which was almost unbearable for him. He believed she was lying on purpose, and he felt she had said it just to hurt him, an exaggerated statement like a heavy punch that would knock him down instantly.\n[1963-08-10T21:05:10] Renting House | I thought about it, but Lina's words sounded too terrifying to me, just like Stefano's punches and kicks. I sensed that beneath his gentle and polite appearance, there was a kind of violence that frightened me. At the same time, I couldn't stand Lina's courage—she spoke the truth so boldly, as if it were a lie.\n[1963-08-10T21:05:15] Renting House | I thought about every word she said to Stefano, which made him regain his reason, but left me in pain. He thought it was a lie, but I knew: it was the truth!\n[1963-08-10T21:10:00] Rentals | I saw when Capodimonte's boss's voice became clearer. I thought that the worst moments, which both I and Nunzia had feared, had already passed. Don Achille had withdrawn from his son, Stefano had returned to normal, becoming once again the gentle, easygoing Stefano.\n[1963-08-11T05:00:00] Renting House | I saw that the door wasn't open, the key wouldn't turn, and the door lock finally moved only when morning came. I saw Stefano's voice become very sad, as if it were a low, pleading request.\n[1963-08-11T05:30:00] Renting House | I saw myself and Nunzia waiting outside for several hours, we kept each other company and encouraged each other, speaking in quiet voices, just like the people inside.\n[1963-08-11T05:35:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia whisper something, and I just naturally believed her, whispering back. \"I heard, 'If I told Rino about this, he'd kill Stefano, he'd definitely kill him.'\"\n\"Please, don't tell him.\"\n[1963-08-11T05:40:00] Renting House | I thought, but at the same time I thought: After Lina got married, Rino and Fernando never touched her again, but ever since she was born, they had beaten her whenever they wanted.\n[1963-08-11T05:45:00] Apartment for Rent | I saw myself sighing. I thought, and then I thought again: all men are the same, only Nino is an exception, but my resentment grew stronger and stronger. Now it was clear—Lina would take Nino for herself, even though she was already married. They would escape this disgusting reality together, but I would never be able to get free.",

    "text": "[1963-08-11T06:00:00] Rentals | I saw that it was just beginning to get light, and Stefano came out of the bedroom, but Lina didn't. He said. I heard, \"You two, pack your belongings, we're leaving.\"\n[1963-08-11T06:05:00] Renting House | I saw Nunzia's face full of anger, and couldn't help pointing at the things he had broken, saying that these would have to be compensated to the landlord. I heard him say, \"This house's rent was paid by me. Your vacation was paid for by me, everything you have—your husband, your son—all their money came from me. So shut up and pack your things and leave.\" I thought of the words Nunzia had screamed before, etched into his mind, and he felt an urgent need to refute them.\n[1963-08-11T06:30:00] Rentals | I saw Nunzia remain silent, and after a while, Lina came out of the room. I saw her wearing a long-sleeved yellow dress and big glasses, like those worn by movie stars.\n[1963-08-11T07:00:00] Port | I saw that she didn't speak to us, didn't speak at the port, didn't speak on the motorboat, and not even when we reached our Mergellina.\n[1963-08-11T09:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her go straight home with her husband, without even saying hello.\n[1963-08-11T10:00:00] My home | I thought, as for me, from that moment on, I decided to live only for myself. Since returning to San Gregorio Armeno, I've been doing just that, and I've made the decision to cut ties with Lina.\n[1963-08-12T09:00:00] My home | I saw that I didn't go back to Lina, nor did I go back to Nino.\n[1963-08-12T20:00:00] My home | I saw myself silently enduring my mother's scolding, saying that I went to Vomero to enjoy myself, without considering that the family needed money. When I heard my mother curse me in front of him, my father would immediately join in: \"You've grown up, you should be responsible now, you need to earn money for the family, we really need money.\" I thought that although my father kept praising my healthy skin tone and golden hair, he hadn't stopped talking about me either.\n[1963-08-13T09:00:00] My home | I should have asked Lina for the money she'd promised me, since I took her to Vomero, but I'd already made up my mind not to see her again, so I didn't go to ask for the money. I thought about making money, and it was really urgent, especially after Stefano said those cruel things to Nunzia (in a way, those words were also meant for me).\n[1963-08-13T10:00:00] Mergellina | I remember once I ran into Alfonso Carracci and had him tell Lina that I'd already gotten the books for the school year, so she didn't need to worry about it. I thought that for the same reason, I would never again accept her buying my school textbooks as I had before.\n[1963-08-16T09:00:00] Bookstore | After the Feast of the Assumption of Mary on August fifteenth, I went again to the bookstore on Via Mezzocannone. I thought it was because I was a well-behaved and hardworking salesgirl, and on the other hand, because of my appearance, I looked much more beautiful after sunbathing by the sea. The bookstore owner first refused, but then let me go back to work there.\n[1963-08-16T09:10:00] Bookstore | I saw him, but he asked me to continue working there after the school started. I had to go in the afternoon, and I had to stay for the entire textbook sales season at the school. I agreed to his request.\n[1963-08-20T15:00:00] Bookstore | I saw myself starting work at the bookstore, greeting the teachers who came to sell their books, as well as students bringing in old books to sell for even less money. I knew the teacher's bag contained books given by the publisher, which could be obtained for just a few lira. I think of each day, and each day feels long.\n[1963-08-25T23:00:00] My home | I thought about how for a whole week I was extremely anxious because my period didn't come, and I was afraid that Nino had made me pregnant. I was so desperate.\n[1963-08-26T03:00:00] My home | I couldn't sleep all night, I didn't seek any advice or comfort from anyone, I kept everything hidden inside me. I thought that on the surface I was solemn, but inside I was panicking.\n[1963-08-30T17:00:00] Bookstore | I finally saw the bloodstain one afternoon in the dirty restroom of the bookstore. I thought that was one of the few happy moments I had during that time. For me, this period seemed like a symbol, completely erasing Nino's violation of my body.\n[1963-09-01 10:00:00] At the shoe repair shop door | I saw Stefano park the car in front of the shoemaker's shop, get out and open the door for me. He extended his hand to help me down.\n[1963-09-01 10:00:10] Outside the shoe repair shop | I saw him completely ignoring Lina; she got down from behind on her own.\n[1963-09-01 10:00:20] Outside the shoe repair shop | I saw him standing in front of the window with me, Rino and Fernando inside the shop, casting us curious glances. I thought I saw a flicker of irritation in their expressions.\n[1963-09-01 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina catch up with us. Stefano opened the shop door, let me go in first, then he went in himself, without letting Lina go in first.\n[1963-09-01 10:00:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw how he was very polite to Fernando and his son, asking if he could see the shoes. Rino hurriedly ran to get them.\n[1963-09-01 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him look at it carefully and praised it. I heard, \"These shoes are light and durable, the design is very nice, what do you think, Rino.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"It's very beautiful.\" I thought to myself, I'm very embarrassed to say.\n[1963-09-01 10:01:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard him say to Fernando, \"Your daughter said that the three of you took a long time to make it, and you want to continue making other styles, and also women's ones.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:01:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino looking at his sister in surprise. I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:01:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando saying uneasily as well. I heard, \"Yes, but not right away.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:01:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Do you have any blueprints that I can take a look at first?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:01:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino say something to his sister, slightly changing his tone because he was afraid of being refused. I heard, \"You go get the blueprint.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:02:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina go without resistance to the back of the shop, and when she returned, she handed some blueprints to her brother. I thought that would surprise him.\n[1963-09-01 10:02:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino hand the blueprint over to Stefano. I knew those were all the design sketches Lina had drawn two years ago.\n[1963-09-01 10:02:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano showing me a pair of women's shoes with high heels. He asked. I heard, \"Would you buy shoes in this style?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:02:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:02:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him look at the blueprint again. He was sitting on a stool, and had taken off his shoe from his right foot. I heard, \"What a big pair of shoes!\"\n[1963-09-01 10:02:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino tell a lie. I heard, \"Forty-three, but it's almost like a forty-four.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:03:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina kneeling in front of Stefano, using a shoe horn to help him put on his new shoes. I thought of this, and it once again surprised us.\n[1963-09-01 10:03:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw and then she took off his other shoe and put the other one on his foot as well.\n[1963-09-01 10:03:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that up until then, Stefano had been acting very smoothly and confidently. I thought about it, but I saw that at that moment he was clearly uneasy.\n[1963-09-01 10:03:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him waiting for Lina to stand up, then he sat again for a few more seconds to catch his breath, and finally he stood up and took a few steps.\n[1963-09-01 10:03:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard him say, \"These shoes are tight.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:03:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino's face turn pale instantly. I thought I saw his disappointment.\n[1963-09-01 10:04:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"We can make it wider with a last.\" Fernando inserted. I thought I detected uncertainty in his tone.\n[1963-09-01 10:04:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano looking at me and asked. I heard, \"How do I look in it?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:04:20] Shoe Repair Shop | \"I heard 'Very good.' I said.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:04:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Then I'll buy it.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:04:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando expressionless, while Rino's face turned from gloomy to bright.\n[1963-09-01 10:04:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"You see, Stefano, these are special 'Lina' shoes, very expensive.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:05:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano smiling, speaking in a very gentle tone. I heard, \"If it wasn't the special 'Lina' shoes, would you have bought them? When will you get them done?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:05:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino looking at his father. I saw a face glowing with excitement.\n[1963-09-01 10:05:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard Fernando say, \"We put the shoes on the machine, at least three days.\" I thought, but it was obvious that he could have said ten days, twenty days, even a month--he needed time to adjust to this unexpected new situation.\n[1963-09-01 10:05:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"That's great, you guys give me a friend's price, I'll come pick up the shoes in three days.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:05:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him fold up the design drawings and put them in his pocket. We all watched him nervously.\n[1963-09-01 10:05:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him shake hands with Fernando and Rino at last, then head toward the door.\n[1963-09-01 10:06:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"blueprints.\" Lina said coldly.\n[1963-09-01 10:06:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano ask in a very polite manner, but before Lina could answer, he opened the door and let me go out first, then followed me out himself. I heard, \"Can I return it to you in three days?\"",

    "text": "[1963-09-01 10:06:30] In the car | I saw that I was already sitting in the car, sitting next to him.\n[1963-09-01 10:06:40] Inside the car | I saw that at this point Lina caught up with me, and she said angrily. I heard, \"Do you think my father is a fool, my brother is a fool?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:06:50] Car interior | I heard, \"What do you want to say?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:07:00] In the car | I heard, \"If you think you can fool my family and me, you're wrong.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:07:10] Car interior | \"I'm angry! I'm not Marcello.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:07:20] In the car | I heard, \"Then who are you?\"\n[1963-09-01 10:07:30] In the car | I heard him say, \"A businessman. I've never seen the shoes you designed, not the ones I'm seeing now, but all of them.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:07:40] Car interior | \"I heard 'that is to say?'\"\n[1963-09-01 10:07:50] In the car | I heard, \"That is to say, I need to think. See you in three days.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:08:00] Car interior | I saw Lina staring at him, as if trying to read his thoughts, and she didn't leave the car.\n[1963-09-01 10:08:10] Car interior | I heard her say the one thing I never had the courage to say: \"You see, Marcello has tried every way to buy me, but no one can buy me.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:08:20] Car interior | I saw Stefano looking into her eyes. I thought it was a very long second.\n[1963-09-01 10:08:30] Car interior | I heard, \"If I can't make a hundred lire, I won't spend a single lire.\"\n[1963-09-01 10:09:00] In the car | I saw him start the engine, and we set off. I thought then that I was now certain: this roundabout way was an agreement reached after many meetings and conversations.\n[1963-09-01 10:09:10] Car interior | I heard myself say in a low voice in Italian: \"Stefano, please, could you stop at the corner? If my mother sees me sitting in your car, she'll definitely tear my face off.\"\n[1963-09-01T09:00:00] Main Street of Maizhuokangna | I saw him, but he didn't appear on Via Mazzini or at Mergellina. I thought about early September, and I figured Nino should have already returned from Vomero. I felt afraid, but I also hoped he would show up and say hello.\n[1963-09-05T10:00:00] Mergellina | I only caught a vague glimpse of Lina a couple of times. Once on a Sunday, she was sitting next to her husband as Stefano drove by at high speed. I thought about how just a few seconds were enough to make me angry. What had happened? How had she solved those problems?\n[1963-09-05T10:05:00] Mergellina | I thought about how she still had everything she once had: a car, Stefano, a house with a bathroom, phone, and TV, nice clothes, and a wealthy life. And who knew what schemes were brewing in her mind besides that.\n[1963-09-05T10:10:00] Mergellina | I know what kind of person she is; even if Nino abandons her, she will never abandon Nino. But I immediately suppressed this thought, because I wanted to keep my promise to myself: I would live my own life, keep them out of it, and no longer suffer over it.\n[1963-09-05T16:00:00] New Capodimonte | I saw it on an afternoon in early September, just as she was about to make up her mind to leave, when Nino appeared at the door. I saw Nino appear at the entrance of Capodimonte, which was crowded with people, his beard unshaven and completely drunk.\n[1963-09-05T16:01:00] New Capodimonte | I saw Pinocchia about to chase away this hobo-like young man, but Lina stopped her, pulling Nino away with a firm and cold voice. I heard her say, \"I'll go.\" to Pinocchia.\n[1963-09-05T16:02:00] New Capodimonte | I knew that Pinocchia Peluso certainly didn't recognize it as Nino's son, because in her eyes, the Nino of that time was a complete stranger with [mental health issues], entirely different from the boy who had gone to elementary school with them. I thought Lina would act immediately, as always, a woman who could solve any problem.\n[1963-09-05T16:03:00] New Capodimonte | I saw the walls covered with goods disappear, the streets became unfamiliar, and the new buildings with pale exteriors also vanished. I thought, but in reality, at that time she didn't even know where she was, especially she couldn't sense the danger she was facing.\n[1963-09-05T16:04:00] On the street | I thought of Nino! Nino! Nino! All she felt was joy and desire.\n[1963-09-05T16:05:00] Street | I saw him appear in front of her, finally appearing before her again. Every feature on his body clearly showed that he had suffered great pain, and the pain was still continuing. I thought about how he was searching for Lina, how he longed for her too.\n[1963-09-05T16:06:00] Street | I saw her still on the street, and he wanted to grab her desperately, kiss her intimately.\n[1963-09-05T16:10:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina pull him into her house. I thought that she considered it the safest place; passersby? She could no longer see them; neighbors? She completely ignored them.\n[1963-09-05T16:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her just shut the door, and then they started having sex without any hesitation. I thought she just wanted to get Nino right away, to merge with him instantly.\n[1963-09-05T16:30:00] Lina's house | I saw the Mergellina, the neighbors, Capodimonte, the street, the sound of the railway, and Stefano and Pinocchia probably waiting anxiously for her; all these began to slowly return to her mind. I thought that even when everything had calmed down, that desire remained very strong.\n[1963-09-05T16:31:00] Lina's house | I thought she clearly understood that these matters, like items that needed to be sorted out as soon as possible, would get them into trouble. If they weren't careful, these chaotic issues would collapse all at once.\n[1963-09-05T16:35:00] Lina's house | I saw Nino scold her, saying that she hadn't even said goodbye when she left, then he tightly embraced her and wanted her.\n[1963-09-05T16:36:00] Lina's house | I saw him wanting to take her away immediately, but he didn't know where to go; she said she was willing, she was willing. I thought both of them were crazy.\n[1963-09-05T16:40:00] Lina's house | I saw the chandelier above them like a threat. I thought that unlike Nino, Lina now felt time slipping away, each second rushing by, and the risk of being discovered was increasing.\n[1963-09-05T16:41:00] Lina's house | I saw her and Nino lying on the floor, staring up at the chandelier hanging from the ceiling. I thought back to the beginning, when all she wanted was to have Nino right away, no matter what. She started calculating how she could keep holding on to him tightly, without worrying about the chandelier falling from the ceiling or the floor cracking. She leaned one way, Nino the other, separating them forever.\n[1963-09-05T16:45:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Go away.\" \"No.\" \"Are you crazy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Please, go.\"\n[1963-09-05T17:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her convince him to leave. She waited for Pinocchia to scold her, for the neighbors to gossip, for Stefano to come from another Capodimonte and hit her. I thought about it, but nothing happened, and she sighed with relief.\n[1963-09-06T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw later that she gave Pinocchia a raise, became even more attentive to her husband, and came up with every excuse to meet Nino secretly.\n[1963-09-10 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that Lina's life changed in September, and the process wasn't simple, but it did undergo a fundamental transformation.\n[1963-09-10 10:00:10] Mergellina | I thought, as for me, I came back from Ischia and fell in love with Nino, my body had been defiled by his father's lips and hands.\n[1963-09-10 10:00:20] Mergellina | I thought the excitement and fear intertwined deep within me should have made me weep day and night, but within just a few hours, my emotions had already been adjusted.\n[1963-09-10 10:00:30] Mergellina | I thought about how I had set aside Nino's voice, his father's beard, and Vomero was beginning to fade, disappearing into a secret corner of my mind.\n[1963-09-10 10:00:40] Mergellina | I thought about how my mind was full of things that had happened to Lina.",

I thought about how I had learned to control and mute my own emotions.\n[1963-09-10T10:00:00] Bookstore | I would calmly push away the bookstore owner's hand if he reached for me; if the customers who came to sell books were rude, I would remain composed and do what needed to be done; even in front of my mother, I could speak softly and gently.\n[1963-09-10T11:00:00] Bookstore | I thought to myself every day: This is my fate, I must submit to destiny, accept reality. I was born in this city, speak this dialect, have no money, give what I can give, gain what I can gain, endure what I must endure.\n[1963-09-12 10:00:00] Capodimonte | Three days after we went for a drive in our shiny convertible, Lina often went to Stefano's Capodimonte, claiming she needed to do some shopping, and each time she asked me to go with her.\n[1963-09-12 10:00:10] Capodimonte | I thought about how I always felt uneasy, worried that Marcello might get angry, but at the same time I was happy with my role, because I could listen to her thoughts wholeheartedly and offer her advice.\n[1963-09-12 10:00:20] Capodimonte | I realized I was an accomplice in this play, the one Stefano apparently focused on.\n[1963-09-12 10:00:30] Capodimonte | I thought we were all just girls, believing we had no guile, acting purely from the facts—Marcello, Stefano, the shoes—we approached everything with our usual passion, feeling we could control everything.\n[1963-09-12 10:00:40] Capodimonte | I said, \"I told him that way.\" She assumed, expecting me to suggest a small change. I said, \"No, you should tell him that way.\"\n[1963-09-12 10:00:50] Capodimonte | I saw them, and then she and Stefano began to talk closely in a corner behind the counter.\n[1963-09-12 10:01:00] Capodimonte | At this point, Alfonso Carracci would chat with me for a while, while Pinocchia impatiently attended to the customers.\n[1963-09-12 10:01:10] Capodimonte | I saw Maria at the checkout counter, nervously watching her eldest son, who had become careless about his work, causing the neighbors to gossip.\n[1963-09-13 10:00:00] Street | I thought, of course, we both acted on a whim.\n[1963-09-13 10:00:10] Street | I thought about those days of back and forth, when I was always trying to figure out what Lina was thinking, so I could go along with her and help her achieve her goals.\n[1963-09-13 10:00:20] Street | I thought at first that she just wanted to make some money for her father and brother, selling the only pair of shoes made by the \"Lina\" shop at a high price to Stefano.\n[1963-09-13 10:00:30] Street | I thought about it, but I quickly realized her goal was to use this young Capodimonte boss to get rid of Marcello.\n[1963-09-13 10:00:40] Street | I got a definite answer on this one time when I asked her. I heard, \"Which of the two do you prefer?\"\n[1963-09-13 10:00:50] Street | I saw her shrug. I heard, \"I've never liked Marcello, he makes me sick.\"\n[1963-09-13 10:01:00] Street | I heard, \"You were engaged to Stefano just to kick Marcello out of your house?\"\n[1963-09-13 10:01:10] Street | I saw her think for a moment and then nod.\n[1963-09-13 10:02:00] Street | I thought that from that moment on, our sense of ultimate goal was: through various means, to eliminate Marcello from her life.\n[1963-09-13 10:02:10] Street | I thought about other things by chance, we were only directing the course of events, sometimes truly manipulating them — at least that's how we saw it. But in reality, it was always Stefano who took action.\n[1963-09-14 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | Three days later, I saw Stefano arrive at the shop very punctually to buy those shoes, even though they were too tight for him.\n[1963-09-14 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina and her father nervously asking for twenty-five thousand lira, but they were already prepared to lower the price to ten thousand lira.\n[1963-09-14 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him not blink an eye and added another two million lira to buy Lina's blueprints.\n[1963-09-14 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him say he really liked those drawings and wanted to put them in a frame.\n[1963-09-14 10:00:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"Should we put it in a frame?\" Rino asked.\n[1963-09-14 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"Yes.\"\n[1963-09-14 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Like a painter's work?\"\n[1963-09-14 10:01:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-09-14 10:01:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Did you tell my sister that you also want to buy her drawings?\"\n[1963-09-14 10:01:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"He said.\"\n[1963-09-15T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that at the beginning, the biggest problem wasn't the rumors, but the boy she deeply loved. I thought of him grabbing her without restraint, kissing her, biting her, entering her, as if he longed to do this for a lifetime, his lips pressing against her, entering her body.\n[1963-09-15T10:05:00] Mergellina | When I saw that he couldn't stand being apart, he turned to alcohol to numb himself. He stopped studying and smoked constantly. I felt scared thinking about him, scared that she would disappear again; it seemed as though, for him, nothing else in the world existed besides the two of them. If he spoke, it was always with jealousy, saying he couldn't stand her continuing to live with her husband.\n[1963-09-15T10:10:00] Mergellina | \"I've given up everything,\" he muttered, exhausted. \"What about you? Don't you want to give up anything?\" \"What are you going to do?\" she asked.\n[1963-09-15T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw Nino say nothing, as if he didn't understand what she was asking, or perhaps he was about to get angry, as if the question had made him upset. I heard him say, desperately, \"You don't want me anymore!\"\n[1963-09-15T10:20:00] Mergellina | I saw it, but Lina wanted him, she wanted him, and after getting him, she still wanted more. I thought of her, but she wanted him to keep studying, to still ignite her thoughts as he had when in Vomero.\n[1963-09-16 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that Stefano didn't stop there. In the following days, he appeared again at the cobbler's shop.\n[1963-09-16 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him tell the father and son that he had also rented the store next to their shop.\n[1963-09-16 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard him say, \"That's it for now. If one day you need to expand your shop, just let me know.\"\n[1963-09-16 12:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that in Lina's house, they discussed quietly for a long time, analyzing the meaning of \"expand.\"\n[1963-09-16 12:10:00] Lina's house | I saw it to the end, and when Lina saw that they had no clue, she said. I heard, \"He's suggesting that you turn the shoe repair shop into a workshop producing 'Lina' brand shoes.\"\n[1963-09-16 12:10:10] Lina's house | I saw Rino ask very carefully. I heard, \"Where does the money come from?\"\n[1963-09-16 12:10:20] Lina's house | \"I heard 'He took the money.'\"\n[1963-09-16 12:10:30] Lina's House | \"I heard you say 'he told you'?\" Fernando asked suspiciously, unable to believe it. Nunzia immediately asked the same thing.\n[1963-09-16 12:10:40] Lina's House | I saw \"He was talking to both of you,\" Lina said, pointing at my father and brother.\n[1963-09-16 12:10:50] Lina's house | I heard, \"Does he know that handmade shoes are expensive?\"\n[1963-09-16 12:11:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"You've sold it to him at a high price, and he already knows.\"\n[1963-09-16 12:11:10] Lina's House | I heard, \"What if it doesn't sell?\"\n[1963-09-16 12:11:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"You wasted your effort, and he lost money.\"\n[1963-09-16 12:11:30] Lina's House | I heard, \"That's it?\"",

I knew Marcello had become secondary—when he came for dinner at 8:30, the meal wasn't even ready yet.\n[1963-09-16 20:45:00] Lina's house | I often saw him sitting in front of the TV with Melina and Pinocchia, while Lina's whole family talked in another room.\n[1963-09-18 10:00:00] Street | I saw it all naturally; the most fervent one was Rino, who had regained his energy, his face glowing with vitality, and he was completely happy, just like when he first became a close friend of the Solara brothers.\n[1963-09-18 10:00:10] Street | I saw it like that, and he began to become friends with Stefano, Alfonso Carracci, Pinocchia, and even Mrs. Maria.\n[1963-09-20 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano go to the shoe shop again, and Fernando finally came clean. After a brief discussion, they reached an oral agreement in the end.\n[1963-09-20 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I knew the basic principle was: Stefano would cover all the expenses, Lina and her son would first make the shoes that Lina and Rino had already made, then other styles, and the profits would be split equally.\n[1963-09-20 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him take out the pieces of paper from his pocket and show them to them one by one.\n[1963-09-20 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard him say, \"You make this style, this one, and this one,\" but he added, \"I hope you won't take two years to make a pair of shoes like last time.\"\n[1963-09-20 10:00:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando awkwardly explaining. I heard, \"My daughter is a girl, and Rino hasn't fully mastered the craft yet.\"\n[1963-09-20 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano politely shake his head.\n[1963-09-20 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"This time, don't let Lina get involved, you should find workers.\"\n[1963-09-20 10:01:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard \"Who pays the workers?\" Fernando asked. I heard, \"Let me pay. You pick two or three workers; you can decide who to choose yourself.\"\n[1963-09-20 10:01:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando's face turn red as soon as he mentioned hiring people, and he became so excited that he was almost incoherent.\n[1963-09-20 10:01:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino nearby, looking at my father with some contempt.\n[1963-09-20 10:01:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando say that he had learned the craft from his father, who was really a good man.\n[1963-09-20 10:01:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him say that the machines at the Cassoria factory were really hard to work with back then.\n[1963-09-20 10:02:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him say that the biggest mistake of his life was marrying Nunzia, who spent money recklessly and was lazy and gluttonous.\n[1963-09-20 10:02:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought that if he had married Ines, the woman he loved when he was young—a very capable woman—then he might now have his own business, better than the Campanile shoe factory, perhaps with a whole line of products displayed overseas.\n[1963-09-20 10:02:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him say that he had already conceived of a pair of very beautiful shoes, perfect in every way.\n[1963-09-20 10:02:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought that if Stefano hadn't been so fascinated by Lina's messy sketches, they could have already started making the shoes he designed, and who knows how many pairs they might have sold.\n[1963-09-20 10:02:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano listening patiently, and he reiterated that he just wanted to see the designs Lina had created.\n[1963-09-20 10:03:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino take his sister's blueprint, look at it carefully, and ask Stefano with a slight sneer. I heard, \"You're going to put these blueprints in frames and hang them where?\"\n[1963-09-20 10:03:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Hang it here.\"\n[1963-09-20 10:03:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that Rino didn't say anything else. I saw him looking at his father, and suddenly his face grew dark again.\n[1963-09-20 10:03:30] Shoe Repair Shop | \"I've heard, 'Has my sister agreed?'\" he asked.\n[1963-09-20 10:03:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano smile slightly.\n[1963-09-20 10:03:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"If your sister doesn't agree, who would dare to do that?\"\n[1963-09-20 10:04:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him stand up, shake hands tightly with Fernando, then head toward the door.\n[1963-09-20 10:04:10] At the shoe repair shop door | I saw Rino accompanying Stefano out, and suddenly he felt a surge of worry as the Capodimonte boss was heading toward his red sports car.\n[1963-09-20 10:04:20] Outside the shoe repair shop | I saw Rino shouting something at the door. I heard, \"The shoes made, the brand is still 'Lina'!\"\n[1963-09-20 10:04:30] At the shoe repair shop door | I saw Stefano didn't look back, and made a gesture saying. I heard someone say, \"The shoes designed by the girl from Lina's family must be 'Lina' brand.\"\n[1963-09-20 20:30:00] Lina's house | I said that night, before going out with Pasquale and Antonio. I heard, \"Marcello, have you seen the car Stefano bought?\"\n[1963-09-20 20:30:10] Lina's house | I saw that the TV was on, and Marcello was still lost in his sorrow, not responding.\n[1963-09-20 20:30:20] Lina's house | I saw Rino take out a comb from his pocket, comb his hair, and then put the comb down.\n[1963-09-20 20:30:30] Lina's house | I saw him saying happily. I heard, \"You know, he spent forty-five thousand lira to buy the shoes we made.\"\n[1963-09-20 20:30:40] Lina's house | I saw Marcello answer, and suddenly Melina laughed. I heard, \"That means he has money to spend.\" I wondered whether it was because of the TV program or because of the thing Marcello had said.\n[1963-09-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw the gifted girl from elementary school, the little girl who had fascinated Oliviero, the one who had written The Blue Fairy, once again showing new energy. I knew it was Nino, who found the little girl in a dark corner and pulled her out.\n[1963-09-20T10:05:00] Mergellina | I thought of that girl, who now wished he would regain his strength and return to who he had been before—a young scholar who had helped her grow, who had made her shed the identity of Mrs. Carraci.\n[1963-09-25 20:00:00] Lina's house | Since then, every night, Rino always found various ways to provoke Marcello, and the atmosphere at home grew increasingly tense.\n[1963-09-25 20:00:10] Lina's house | Every time Solara came, Nunzia always greeted him warmly, while Lina would disappear, saying she was tired and then went to sleep.\n[1963-09-28 20:30:00] Lina's house | I saw one night that Marcello was very depressed and said to Nunzia. \"I heard, 'As soon as I arrived, your daughter went to sleep. So what am I here for?'\"\n[1963-09-28 20:30:10] Lina's house | I saw that he hoped Nunzia would comfort him with a few words, say something encouraging to give him the courage to win Lina's love, but Nunzia didn't know how to answer him.\n[1963-09-28 20:30:20] Lina's house | I saw him ask in a low voice. I heard, \"Is she starting to like someone else?\"\n[1963-09-28 20:30:30] Lina's house | I heard \"No.\"\n[1963-09-28 20:30:40] Lina's House | I heard, \"I know she often buys things from Stefano's store.\"\n[1963-09-28 20:30:50] Lina's House | \"I heard, 'My child, then where should she buy food?'\"\n[1963-09-28 20:31:00] Lina's house | I saw Marcello stop speaking and lower his eyes.\n[1963-09-28 20:31:10] Lina's house | I heard, \"Someone saw her get into the boss's car, Capodimonte.\"\n[1963-09-28 20:31:20] Lina's House | I heard, \"Elena is also in the car, and Stefano is chasing the concierge's daughter.\"\n[1963-09-28 20:31:30] Lina's house | I heard, \"I think Elena isn't a good companion for your daughter. Tell Lina not to see her anymore.\"",

    "text": "[1963-10-01 16:00:00] Street | I wondered if I wasn't a good companion? Shouldn't Lina stop meeting me? When my friend told me about Marcello's request, I completely took Stefano's side.\n[1963-10-01 16:05:00] Street | I found myself starting to speak well of him, mentioning specific things, saying he was very determined and very rich. I heard myself saying to her at the end, and as I spoke those words, I realized that the wealth we had dreamed of as children was changing again.\n[1963-10-01 16:10:00] Street | I knew that as children, we used to imagine: publishing a book like Little Women would bring us wealth and reputation, along with a safe full of gold coins, and a crowd of servants in uniforms waiting to serve us in our castle. I thought those imaginations had completely faded away.\n[1963-10-01 16:10:10] Street | I thought that maybe, for us now, money was like cement—it could reinforce my life, prevent our lives and those of our dearest from collapsing together, and this feeling was growing stronger.\n[1963-10-01 16:10:20] Street | I thought that the most fundamental characteristic of wealth had begun to take shape gradually, becoming part of daily life, becoming business and negotiations.\n[1963-10-01 16:10:30] Street | I thought about the wealth of adolescence, the naive and fantastical images, those shoes that no one had ever seen, which later concretely manifested as Rino's dissatisfaction and irritability, his desire to spend money like a wealthy man.\n[1963-10-01 16:10:40] Street | I thought of wealth as the television, Marcello's noodles, and the ring, things he wanted to use to buy a feeling.\n[1963-10-01 16:10:50] Street | I thought of how, in the end, wealth was embodied in that young, polite Stefano, who made a living selling sausages and had a red convertible.\n[1963-10-01 16:11:00] Street | I thought about how he didn't even blink when he spent forty-five thousand lira. He put the blueprints in frames, and besides selling cheese, he also wanted to get into the shoe business.\n[1963-10-01 16:11:10] Street | I thought about how he invested in leather, hired people, as if he were absolutely certain he could open up a new era of peace and prosperity.\n[1963-10-01 16:11:20] Street | I thought that this was the manifestation of wealth in daily life, devoid of any brilliance or glory.\n[1963-10-01 16:12:00] Street | I saw and heard Lina repeating the words, she laughed, and finally added. I heard, \"He's very rich, and he's also cute, kind-hearted.\"\n[1963-10-01 16:12:10] Street | I said right away that I felt the same, that was a quality Marcello didn't have, and that was another reason to stand with Stefano. I thought, but the two adjectives Lina used confused me. I felt it meant that the radiant imaginations of our childhood had come to an end: castles, safes.\n[1963-10-01 16:12:20] Street | I realized I had understood, and these fantasies would no longer be connected to Lina or my life; we would never again lie together writing a story like \"Little Women.\"\n[1963-10-01 16:12:30] Street | I thought of wealth, which had taken the form of Stefano, a young man in an oily shirt.\n[1963-10-01 16:12:40] Street | I thought of wealth, which was taking on a shape, a smell, and a sound, revealing itself as friendly and charming—a familiar man, the eldest son of Don Achille.\n[1963-10-01 16:12:50] Street | I thought about it and felt very excited.\n[1963-10-01 16:13:00] Street | \"I heard, 'No matter what, he once wanted to pierce your tongue.' I said.\"\n[1963-10-01 16:13:10] Street | I saw her respond with emotion, her voice very sweet, a tone I had never heard before. I heard, \"At that time, he was still a child.\"\n[1963-10-01 16:13:20] Street | I realized then that things had gone beyond what she had told me.\n[1963-10-01T08:30:00] School | I didn't realize I had entered my senior year until I saw the school starting on October 1st and walked into the classroom. I thought about how I had already turned eighteen, and although my academic journey had been unusually long, it was almost over, which was better.\n[1963-10-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that, bit by bit, she succeeded; whatever the reason, he had started studying again. I thought about how I didn't know how things had changed, but Nino must have realized it. In order not to lose Lina, he couldn't just be a crazy lover. Maybe he simply realized that passion had emptied his mind.\n[1963-10-01T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know Lina is satisfied with this: he is slowly regaining his normal self, becoming the boy she met at Vomero again, which is also important for Nino. I thought about how she not only once again had Nino, but also his words, his thoughts.\n[1963-10-01T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Nino buying a lot of books to read. He read Adam Smith, Joyce, but found them all rather dull. He wanted Lina to read them with him, and when they met, he wanted to talk about those books, but he never managed to do it. I know, but they don't meet often.\n[1963-10-05 10:00:00] Street | I thought that in the days to come, everything would become even clearer. I heard Lina speak of Stefano, and her tone seemed to have beautified him.\n[1963-10-05 10:00:10] Street | I thought about how I had been adapting to the alliance they were forming, avoiding being left out.\n[1963-10-05 10:00:20] Street | I thought about how we had spent several hours plotting together—just the two of us, or maybe the three of us—so that people, feelings, and events would go according to our wishes.\n[1963-10-05T15:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself talking a lot with Alfonso Carracci about what we could do after graduation, and he, like me, wasn't really sure about the options after college. I thought we would attend some job interviews, so he just said it off the top of his head, but in reality, he wasn't even sure what a job interview was.\n[1963-10-05T15:05:00] Mergellina | I heard us say \"apply\" and get a job. I thought, but for us, the concept of applying for a job was vague: were we supposed to take a written test? Would there be an interview? Would that really get us a position? A salary?\n[1963-10-05T15:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Alfonso Carracci and he told me he wanted to get married, no matter what position he obtained; once he had a job, he would marry immediately. I heard, \"With Pinocchio.\"  \n\"Of course!\"\n[1963-10-05T15:15:00] Mergellina | I remember asking about Nino a few times, but he didn't seem to like Nino, and they didn't even exchange greetings. I heard him say that Nino was ugly, his whole body loose and crooked. I thought about how he never understood what I liked about Nino.\n[1963-10-05T15:20:00] Mergellina | I thought Pinocchio was very beautiful, and he quickly added, fearing I might be upset. I heard, \"You're very beautiful too.\"\n[1963-10-05T15:25:00] Mergellina | I know he's very fond of looking good and likes to dress well. He pays a lot of attention to his appearance, always shaving his beard neatly. He buys clothes and goes to the gym almost every day.\n[1963-10-05T15:30:00] Mergellina | I saw him and he told me he was happy working in the store on Martiri Square, which wasn't like Capodimonte. I heard him say, \"In the shoe store, you can dress elegantly, you must dress elegantly. You can speak Italian, everyone who goes there is polite and has been to school.\"\n[1963-10-05T15:35:00] Mergellina | I saw that there, when you kneel half-kneeling before the male and female guests, helping them put on their shoes, you can be very graceful, like a knight in love at court, but now he can't stay in the shop anymore. I heard \"Why?\"  \n\"Ah.\"\n[1963-10-05T15:40:00] Mergellina | I saw that at first he didn't explain carefully, and I didn't pry either. Later, he told me. I know that Pinocchio has been staying mostly at home these days because she doesn't want to exert herself; her belly has gotten bigger.\n[1963-10-05T15:45:00] Mergellina | I knew, obviously, that after the child was born, she had even less time to work. In theory, this should have cleared his path, since the Solara brothers were satisfied with him; perhaps he could have started working there right after high school. I thought that there was no way it could happen now, and suddenly Lina appeared.\n[1963-10-05T15:50:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"What does that have to do with her?\" I thought of just hearing her name, and my stomach would twist painfully.\n[1963-10-05T15:55:00] Mergellina | I know from Alfonso Carracci that after Lina came back from her vacation by the sea, she went completely crazy. She still couldn't [have a child], and swimming in the sea hadn't helped.\n[1963-10-05T16:00:00] Mergellina | I saw Alfonso Carracci list a series of her [mental health issues]. I know once, she broke all the flowerpots on the balcony. She said she was going to Capodimonte, but she left Pinocchia alone there. She herself wandered around the streets, and in the evening, Stefano woke up and found her not in bed—she was moving around the room, reading and writing.\n[1963-10-05T16:05:00] Mergellina | I know that later she suddenly calmed down, or rather, she used all her abilities to destroy Stefano's life. Her only goal was to get Stefano to hire Giyao La to work at the new Capodimonte, so she could take care of the store in Piazza Martiri.\n[1963-10-05T16:10:00] Mergellina | I said, I was very surprised by what I saw. I heard, \"Michele has always wanted her to work there, but she didn't want to.\"\n[1963-10-05T16:15:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"That's how it was, but she changed her mind. Now she's determined to go there no matter what. The only obstacle is Stefano, but you know, my brother always does whatever she says.\"\n[1963-10-05T16:20:00] Mergellina | I saw that I didn't ask any other questions. I thought to myself that I didn't want to get involved with Lina's affairs again, and I wondered in confusion: What was she thinking? Why had she suddenly decided to work in the city center?",

    "text": "[1963-10-10 09:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw a worker come into the shop next to the shoe repair stand, and he tore down the wall between the two shops.\n[1963-10-10 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that the whole workshop had been rearranged, with three country apprentices from Melito.\n[1963-10-10 10:10:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw they hardly spoke, huddled in a corner continuing to replace the soles of customers' shoes.\n[1963-10-10 10:10:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw other spaces being used by Fernando to place small worktables, shelves, tools, and wooden molds of various sizes.\n[1963-10-10 10:10:20] Shoe Repair Shop | What astonished me was that this incredibly thin man, who had always been dissatisfied with reality, suddenly became full of energy and started planning to start a business.\n[1963-10-10T11:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw Pinocchia frowning as she looked at Lina. I know Pinocchio is getting more and more confused now. She doesn't understand what's so urgent about Lina's business. She always comes up with one excuse or another and disappears for several hours.\n[1963-10-10T11:05:00] Capodimonte | Even when Capodimonte was at its busiest, Lina always let her handle the customers alone, as if she couldn't see or hear anything, completely immersed in her book, fully focused on writing in her notebook.\n[1963-10-10T11:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw that only when you called her name did her gaze lift from the book, her fingertip brushing her lips. I heard, \"Lina! Please, help me!\" She said, \"Okay!\"\n[1963-10-15 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | On the very day their new job was about to start, Stefano showed up.\n[1963-10-15 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him take a package wrapped in paper. Everyone, including Fernando, stood up as if someone was coming to inspect us.\n[1963-10-15 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano open the package, which contained several small paintings of the same size, framed in brown.\n[1963-10-15 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that it was a page from Lina's notebook, now framed under glass, like a precious artifact.\n[1963-10-15 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him ask Fernando to hang the design drawings on the wall, and Fernando muttered something.\n[1963-10-15 10:01:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano having Rino and a few apprentices nail the nails into the wall.\n[1963-10-15 10:02:00] Shoe Repair Shop | After I saw those blueprints hanging on the wall, Stefano gave the three apprentices some money to go get coffee.\n[1963-10-15 10:03:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that only Stefano and the cobbler father and son were left in the shop. He whispered that he wanted to marry Lina.\n[1963-10-15 10:03:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw the shop fall into an unbearable silence.\n[1963-10-15 10:03:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino smile slightly, as if he had already known the outcome, Fernando said in a very faint voice. I heard, \"Stefano, Lina is Marcello's fiancée.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:03:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"But your daughter doesn't know about this.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:03:40] Shoe Repair Shop | \"I heard 'Dad, what did you say?' Rino inserted himself at this moment, saying it very happily. I heard, \"You have to tell the truth. You and Mom let that bastard come to the house every day. Lina never accepted him. Lina just didn't like him at all.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:03:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando glare fiercely at his son. Stefano looked around and said very politely. I heard, \"Now our work has begun, don't spoil the good mood. All I ask of you, Don Fernando, is that you let your daughter decide for herself.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:04:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"If she chooses Marcello, I'll step back. I love her very much. If she can be happy with someone else, I'll withdraw, and we'll just remain as we were before.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:04:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"If she chose me and accepted me, I wouldn't be polite—I'd make her marry me.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:04:20] Shoe Repair Shop | \"I'm asking you, are you threatening me?\" Fernando said. I thought I detected a gentle, somewhat helpless tone in his voice.\n[1963-10-15 10:04:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"It's not a threat, I'm just begging you, do a good deed for your daughter.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:04:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"I know how to treat her well.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:04:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard, \"Yes, but she knows better than you do.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:05:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that, at that moment, Stefano stood up and opened the door to call me. I heard \"Elena!\"\n[1963-10-15 10:05:10] Outside the shoe repair shop | I saw myself and Lina waiting outside together. We went in, feeling like the central figures in this whole thing. I thought about how I liked this feeling, that we had finally seen things come to a clear conclusion.\n[1963-10-15 10:05:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought about how I was extremely excited and nervous at that time.\n[1963-10-15 10:05:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano say to Lina. I heard, \"In front of your father, I want to tell you: I love you more than my own life. Will you marry me?\"\n[1963-10-15 10:05:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina answer very seriously. I heard, \"I do.\"\n[1963-10-15 10:05:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Fernando dialogueless, as he had been before Don Achille, and he muttered something in a low voice. I heard, \"So, we've not only offended Marcello, but the entire Solara family. Now, who's going to tell that poor young man?\"\n[1963-10-15 10:06:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I heard Lina say, \"I'll go talk to her.\"\n[1963-10-15 16:00:00] Street | I knew from that moment on, I was always called upon to join in such tricky choices. I realized that it wasn't Lina who had called me, but Pinocchia and her mother.\n[1963-10-15T20:00:00] Lina's house | I know that as for Stefano, he was caught between intense anger and silent suffering. I thought about how every time his brother-in-law, father-in-law, and the Solara brothers asked about him, he felt a deep bitterness in his heart— he'd gone to the seaside baths, but still hadn't managed to get pregnant.\n[1963-10-15T20:05:00] Lina's house | I saw that, in addition, his wife often teased him about his shoes, and her love for reading had returned. She would spend whole evenings immersed in novels, magazines, and newspapers. I thought I had lost interest in real life.\n[1963-10-15T20:10:00] Lina's house | I saw that sometimes Lina refused Stefano, sometimes she was calm, but completely distracted; Stefano scrutinized Lina. I thought he didn't understand what had happened, or that he didn't have the time or desire to find out about her.\n[1963-10-15T20:15:00] Lina's house | I knew that after leaving Vomero, part of him—the most violent part—would always push him to have a big argument and make a final break; but the other side of him—the careful or even cowardly self—would restrain that violent side, pretending nothing had happened. I thought to myself: This is better than her always looking for trouble.\n[1963-10-15T20:20:00] Lina's house | I saw that as for Lina, she tried to keep her husband in that state. I thought she seemed to know Stefano inside and out.\n[1963-10-15T20:30:00] Lina's house | I saw that in the evening, both of them returned home from work. She was gentle with her husband, but after dinner and conversation, she would immerse herself completely in the world of reading. I thought it was a world that a husband could not enter, a place belonging only to her and Nino.\n[1963-10-18 20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that, in fact, on the third night, Rino was wandering outside while everyone else was at home.\n[1963-10-18 20:05:00] Lina's house | I saw that the TV was still off, and before everyone sat down to eat, Lina asked Marcello. I heard, \"Can you take me for ice cream?\"\n[1963-10-18 20:05:10] Lina's house | I couldn't believe my ears when I saw Marcello. I heard, \"Ice cream? Before dinner? Me and you?\"\n[1963-10-18 20:05:20] Lina's house | I saw him and immediately asked Nunzia. I heard, \"Madam, would you like to go with us?\"\n[1963-10-18 20:05:30] Lina's house | I saw Nunzia turn on the television and say. I heard, \"No, thanks, Marcello. Don't stay too long, dinner will be ready in ten minutes, hurry back.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:05:40] Lina's house | I saw him answer very happily. I heard, \"No problem, thank you...\"\n[1963-10-18 20:05:50] Lina's house | I saw him thank her at least four times, and I felt that the thing I had been looking forward to for so long was finally about to come true—Lina was finally going to accept him.\n[1963-10-18 20:06:00] Street | I saw them, but as soon as they left the building, Lina turned to him and spoke to him, word by word, in that cold and evil tone she had long been skilled at using. I heard, \"I've never told you, but I would have accepted you.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:06:10] Street | I heard, \"I know, but do you accept me now?\"\n[1963-10-18 20:06:20] Street | I heard, \"We don't accept.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:06:30] Street | I saw Marcello, a tall, strong, twenty-three-year-old with a fiery spirit, suddenly lean against a streetlamp pole as if broken by heartbreak.\n[1963-10-18 20:06:40] Street | I heard, \"It really can't be done?\"\n[1963-10-18 20:06:50] Street | I heard, \"No. I love another man.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:07:00] Street | I heard \"Who?\"\n[1963-10-18 20:07:10] Street | I heard \"Stefano.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:07:20] Street | \"I knew it, but I just couldn't believe it.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:07:30] Street | I heard, \"You have to believe, that's just how it is.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:07:40] Street | I heard, \"I'll kill both you and him.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:07:50] Street | I heard, \"You can attack me right away.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:08:00] Street | I saw Marcello furious. He pulled himself away from the streetlamp post and, in a fit of anger, bit his right hand into a fist until it bled.\n[1963-10-18 20:08:10] Street | \"I love you too much to go through with it.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:08:20] Street | \"I heard, 'Then you can have your younger brother, your father, or your friend come. Maybe they can do it.'\"\n[1963-10-18 20:08:30] Street | I heard, \"But you have to make it clear to everyone, they have to kill me first.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:08:40] Street | I heard, \"If I'm alive, and you touch anyone else, I'll kill you all. You know I mean it. I'll start with you.\"\n[1963-10-18 20:08:50] Street | I saw Marcello continue to bite his own fingers, as if he gave a muffled sob, his chest rising and falling.\n[1963-10-18 20:09:00] Street | I saw him turn and walk away in the end.\n[1963-10-18 20:09:10] Street | I saw her shouting behind him. I heard, \"You had the TV taken away, we don't need it!\"",

    "text": "[1963-10-20 16:00:00] Street | I realized, in fact, that it was I who chose the wedding candies, the restaurant and photographer for Tasso Street, and I even convinced them to add a video segment outside of the photo session.\n[1963-10-20 16:00:10] Street | I thought that no matter what the situation, I was aware that for any of these things, I was full of passion, as if the things I was doing were all accumulating experience for my future marriage.\n[1963-10-20 16:00:20] Street | I was very surprised that Lina had put so little thought into the matter of marriage, but it was indeed the case.\n[1963-10-20 16:00:30] Street | I thought about what she was most focused on: establishing her future life in one go, wanting to live at home as a wife and mother, where her sister-in-law and mother-in-law couldn't interfere.\n[1963-10-20 16:00:40] Street | I know, but it wasn't the usual kind of conflict between a mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, and sister-in-law. I had a feeling that she was trying to find a way out of her cage by using me, by manipulating Stefano, but she hadn't found it yet.\n[1963-10-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that at that stage, Nino represented a sexual fervor for her, keeping her in a prolonged sexual fantasy; an intellectual spark, she wanted to be like him, to reach the height of his thoughts. I thought that this made them like an abstract, secret partner— they existed in a closed space, which was both their mental dwelling and the crucible of their thoughts, where they contemplated the complexity of the world.\n[1963-10-20T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know he was present, active, while she was a shadow, following closely behind him, a cautious advisor, a loyal collaborator.\n[1963-10-25 09:00:00] School | I thought about all these things happening within a single month, and finally, I felt that Lina looked very happy.\n[1963-10-25 09:00:10] School | I thought about how she had found a way out regarding the shoes, giving her brother and the whole family a chance. She broke up with Marcello and became engaged to the richest and most envied young man in the entire Mergellina.\n[1963-10-25 09:00:20] School | I wondered what else she wanted? There was nothing left to desire; she had everything.\n[1963-10-25 09:00:30] School | I thought about after the school term started, and I felt my days had become even darker than before. I threw myself completely into my studies, worried sick that I might not be able to answer the teacher's questions.\n[1963-10-25 09:00:40] Posillipo | I saw that I studied until eleven at night and got up at 5:30 in the morning. I had less and less time to meet Lina.\n[1963-10-25T15:00:00] Secret Location | The few times I saw them, their meetings weren't just a few minutes but an hour long, and that hour became a continuous flow of words and sexual exchange. They were so compatible and passionate in every way. I thought about how the moments after parting made it unbearable for her to return to Capodimonte, back to Stefano's bed.\n[1963-10-25T16:00:00] Secret Location | I heard, \"I can't take it anymore.\" \"I can't either.\" \"What are we going to do?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I want to be with you forever.\" \"Or at least spend a few hours together every day.\" She added.\n[1963-10-25T16:05:00] Mergellina | I knew it was extremely dangerous to meet Nino at home, and even more so on the street; and if Stefano happened to call Capodimonte, and she wasn't there, coming up with a plausible excuse would also be risky. I thought about it, but how could she find the time to do it every day? Especially when she also had to make sure it was safe.\n[1963-10-25T16:10:00] Mergellina | I thought like that: on one hand, Nino's impatience, and on the other, her husband's dissatisfaction—she simply couldn't cope. To be precise, she was completely at a loss, unable to think of any solution.\n[1963-10-26 10:00:00] School | I established a good relationship with Alfonso Carracci, the younger brother of Stefano, as compensation. I thought that even though he had helped out all summer in Capodimonte, after school resumed, he had passed every make-up exam with success: he got seven in Latin, Greek, and English.\n[1963-10-26 10:00:10] School | I thought about Gino hoping that Alfonso Carracci would fail the exam so they could both repeat the first year together, but Alfonso Carracci passed, which made him very sad.\n[1963-10-26 10:00:20] School | When he found out that I and Alfonso Carracci were already in our second year of high school, and that we always went to school and came back together every day, his inner resentment grew even more. I ended up becoming very petty, and he stopped talking to me—the former girlfriend, and Alfonso Carracci, his previous desk mate.\n[1963-10-26 10:00:30] School | I know that even though his classroom was just next door, we often met in the hallway, and in our Mergellina, we were always running into each other.\n[1963-10-26 10:00:40] School | I saw more than that—Gino would also speak ill of me and Alfonso Carracci, and these words soon reached my ears. I know he said I've fallen for Alfonso Carracci, and I even touched him during class, but Alfonso Carracci doesn't love me, because he's been his desk partner for a whole year and knows the situation well. He says Alfonso Carracci doesn't like girls, only boys.\n[1963-10-26 10:10:00] School | I saw myself telling Alfonso Carracci these words, hoping he would go and beat up Gino, just like people usually do in such situations.\n[1963-10-26 10:10:10] School | I saw it, but he just said it in his dialect, very contemptuously. I heard, \"Everyone knows he's the real sissy.\"\n[1963-10-26 10:10:20] School | I thought it was a real surprise that Alfonso Carracci appeared just in time for me. He exuded a clean, well-mannered air.\n[1963-10-26 10:10:30] School | I thought about how his face was very similar to Stefano's: the same eyes, the same nose, even the same mouth.\n[1963-10-26 10:10:40] School | I thought that, despite his development during growth, his physical features were similar to Stefano's—his head was large, his upper body long, his legs short. Although his gaze and movements carried the same softness, there was not even a trace of the decisiveness that seemed to radiate from every cell of Stefano's body when I was with Alfonso Carracci.\n[1963-10-26 10:10:50] School | I thought to myself that it was this decisiveness that made Stefano's politeness turn into a mask, giving the impression that he could change his expression at any moment.\n[1963-10-26 10:11:00] School | I thought Alfonso Carracci was a rare guy in the entire Mergellina who made you feel comfortable, someone who you wouldn't think would hurt you.\n[1963-10-26 10:11:10] School | I saw that when we walked together, we would exchange a few words, but never feel embarrassed.\n[1963-10-26 10:11:20] School | I saw that he always had what I needed, and if he didn't, he would get it for me.\n[1963-10-26 10:11:30] School | I thought about how he liked me, which put me at ease, and I gradually developed feelings for him as well.\n[1963-10-26 10:12:00] Classroom | On the first day of school, we became classmates, and in that era, it was a very bold thing to do.\n[1963-10-26 10:12:10] Classroom | I saw that even though the other boys teased him, he stayed by my side all along. Other girls kept asking me if we were dating, but neither of us changed seats.\n[1963-10-26 10:12:20] Classroom | I thought he was a trustworthy person; if he saw that I needed some time alone, he would wait nearby or just say hello and leave first.\n[1963-10-26 10:12:30] Classroom | I thought that if he found out I wanted him to stay with me, even if there was something to do, he would stay.\n[1963-10-26 11:00:00] School | I saw myself escaping through him from Nino.\n[1963-10-26 11:00:10] School | After returning from Vomero, it was the first time we saw each other at school. Nino immediately ran over to me with great enthusiasm, greeting me, but I was cold and distant, dismissing him in just a few words.\n[1963-10-26 11:00:20] School | I thought that even though I really liked him, whenever I saw his tall figure from a distance, my face would flush and my heart would race.\n[1963-10-26 11:00:30] School | I thought about it, but now Lina is engaged, officially engaged. Her fiancé is a twenty-two-year-old man, not a young boy anymore.\n[1963-10-26 11:00:40] School | I thought of his fiancée, who was gentle, strong, and brave. My immediate concern was to find a boyfriend worth envying, to restore the balance between us.\n[1963-10-26 11:00:50] School | I thought that way the four of us could go out together: Lina and her fiancé, and me and my boyfriend.\n[1963-10-26 11:01:00] School | Of course, Nino didn't have a red convertible, he was just a sophomore with no money in his pocket, but he was twenty centimeters taller than me, and Stefano was a few centimeters shorter than Lina.\n[1963-10-26 11:01:10] School | I thought of Nino's Italian, as perfect as that on the pages of a book—he read, thought, discussed issues, and was deeply concerned with all the important questions of human existence, while Stefano spent each day in Capodimonte, speaking only dialect, having stopped going to school after elementary school.\n[1963-10-26 11:01:20] School | I thought that in the shop, his mother was better at handling the accounts than him. He had a good character, especially sensitive when it came to making money.\n[1963-10-26 11:01:30] School | I thought, but although my heart was filled with intense passion for Nino; although I clearly saw that being with Nino would be a glory in Lina's eyes; although when I saw him again, I fell in love with him once more, I felt I couldn't establish a relationship with him.\n[1963-10-26 11:01:40] School | I thought about my childhood and adolescence, which gave me a very solid reason, because the moment I saw him, I immediately thought of Donato Nino, even though they looked nothing alike.\n[1963-10-26 11:01:50] School | I thought about what his father had done to me, and I didn't have the strength to push him away. This memory stirred up my anger and hatred, which then extended to him.\n[1963-10-26 11:02:00] School | I thought, of course, I love him, I long to talk to him, to walk with him.\n[1963-10-26 11:02:10] School | I sometimes think with great effort: why am I doing this? Father is father, son is son. I could treat him the way Stefano treated the Peluso family, but I can't.\n[1963-10-26 11:02:20] School | I thought of the moment when I would have [intimate relations] with him, and I felt Donato's mouth, merging father and son into one, and waves of pleasure and revulsion surged over me.",

I thought that for her, the world was like a game of chess; as long as she shifted the background and moved the pieces, everything could be completely different. It was a game, and the important thing was that it was her game, their game, a game that could go on forever.\n[1963-10-26T10:05:00] Mergellina | I often see scenes of murder and bloodshed appearing in her notes; she never writes about herself being killed, but she records some violent events that happen in society. Sometimes she even invents stories, fictional accounts of women being killed. She focuses on describing the killer's cruelty and the blood splattering everywhere.\n[1963-10-26T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that she wrote about details never mentioned in the newspapers: eyes, neck, breasts, stomach, and lower body were all terrible wounds. I thought she wanted to place that possible violent death on paper, making such an ending controllable.\n[1963-11-01 16:00:00] Street | I also recall another incident that terrified me, making the situation even more complicated.\n[1963-11-01 16:10:00] Street | I've gotten used to it now, and I've developed a habit of walking home with Alfonso Carracci, all the way to Piazza della Repubblica, along Via del Sud. It's a long walk, and we talk about homework, teachers, and our respective classmates. I thought I felt very comfortable.\n[1963-11-01 16:20:00] Near the train station | I remember once when we passed by the pond and walked onto the main road, I turned around and saw a ticket inspector in uniform on the train platform, it looked like Donato Nino.\n[1963-11-01 16:20:10] Near the train station | I looked away immediately. I thought I felt a surge of anger and fear.\n[1963-11-01 16:20:20] Near the Train Station | I saw that when I looked back again, he was no longer there.\n[1963-11-01 16:20:30] Near the Train Station | I thought about how, no matter who I saw, it wasn't him, but my heart was pounding wildly, like a gunshot.\n[1963-11-01 16:20:40] Near the train station | I don't know why, but I thought of the letter Lina wrote to me, in which she described the moment the copper pot was torn apart.\n[1963-11-01T09:00:00] Mergellina | I saw how, in this game that could end in a violent death, Lina joined the conflict between her brother, her husband, and the Solara brothers, using Michele. I knew that Michele had always thought she was the most suitable person to manage the shop on Martirini Square.\n[1963-11-01T09:05:00] Mergellina | I saw her suddenly change her stance, no longer refusing Michele's proposal. After a noisy negotiation, she finally secured her autonomy and a substantial salary, paid weekly. I know, as if she wasn't accepted as Mrs. Calogero, but as a stranger, for the job at the shoe store.\n[1963-11-01T09:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that she didn't care at all about her brother's reaction, nor did she care about her husband's attitude. I know that her brother is now threatened by the new \"Soraya\" brand, and her actions made him feel betrayed; her husband was initially very angry and threatened her, but then asked her to coordinate some complicated matters with the Soraya brothers— he had a loan contract with the Soraya mother, and they needed to negotiate the terms of the loan and repayment.\n[1963-11-01T09:15:00] Shoe Store | I saw her trying to escape Michele's sweet words. I knew he had been hanging around the store, wanting to see how she would mess around in the shop, and also, he hoped that Lina would bypass Rino and Stefano and design the Solara shoes directly for him.\n[1963-11-01T13:00:00] Lina's house | I saw a Sunday in late autumn of 1963, when she refused to go to her mother-in-law's house for dinner—this was usually her attitude—and she carefully prepared a meal.\n[1963-11-01T13:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Stefano go to the Solara's shop to buy some sweets. He would take some for his mother and sister, to make up for his absence over the weekend.\n[1963-11-01T13:10:00] Lina's House | I saw Lina putting some of her undergarments, dresses, and a pair of winter shoes into the suitcase she used for her honeymoon, then hiding the suitcase behind the door in the living room.\n[1963-11-01T13:15:00] Lina's Kitchen | I saw her washing all the used pots, carefully setting the dinner on the kitchen table. She took out a meat-cutting knife from the drawer and placed it next to the sink, covering it with a cloth.\n[1963-11-01T13:20:00] Lina's balcony | I saw, then, she waited for her husband to come home. She opened the window to let the smell of dinner spread, and she stayed on the balcony, watching the passing trains and the shiny rails in the sunlight. I saw the cold air outside dispersing the warmth inside the house. This didn't make her uncomfortable; instead, it filled her with strength.\n[1963-11-01T13:30:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano return, and they sat down at the table to eat; he was annoyed because he had sacrificed his mother's delicious meal. I thought about how he didn't even utter a single word of praise for the meal Lina had carefully prepared.\n[1963-11-01T13:35:00] Lina's house | I saw that she mentioned his brother-in-law Rino with a more ruthless tone than usual, but when talking about her nephew, she used an even more affectionate tone than usual. I thought about how he referred to his nephew several times as \"my sister's child,\" as if Rino had little real connection to his nephew.\n[1963-11-01T13:40:00] Lina's house | When I saw him eating dessert, he had three pieces, but she didn't eat any at all; Stefano carefully wiped the cream from his lips. I heard him say to her, \"Let's go to sleep.\" Lina replied, \"From tomorrow on, I'll never go to the shoe store again.\"\n[1963-11-01T13:41:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Why?\" \"Because I don't want to go.\" \"Did you fight with Michele and Marcello?\" \"No.\" I thought Stefano understood that something was about to happen, and it was definitely not anything good.\n[1963-11-01T13:42:00] Lina's house | \"I heard 'Lina, don't act foolishly. You know very well that my relationship with your brother is already tense right now. Don't make things worse.' 'I'm not causing trouble. I'm not going to work anymore.'\"\n[1963-11-01T13:43:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano fall silent. I thought that Lina understood, that he had already begun to realize the seriousness of the situation. He wanted to brush it off, he was afraid she would speak about the humiliation and insults the Solara brothers had inflicted on her—things that could not be forgiven. If Lina spoke, he would have no choice but to act, causing an inevitable split, something he wasn't ready to do yet.\n[1963-11-01T13:44:00] Lina's house | \"I heard 'Okay,' he decided to speak, 'then you don't go. Go back to Capodimonte.' She replied, 'I don't want to go to Capodimonte either.'\"\n[1963-11-01T13:45:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano looking at her uneasily. \"I heard you say, 'You want to stay home? Good, it's your own choice to go to work, I didn't make you go, right?' 'Yes.' 'Then stay home, that's good for me.' 'I don't want to stay home either.'\"\n[1963-11-01T13:46:00] Lina's house | I could see he was about to lose his patience, but he still managed to suppress his unease and anxiety. I heard, \"If you don't want to stay at home, then I know what the hell you want to do?\" Lina answered, \"I want to leave here.\" \"Where do you want to go?\" \"I don't want to be with you anymore. I want to leave you.\"\n[1963-11-01T13:47:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano didn't know how to respond; he smiled. I thought those words sounded so absurd that for the first few minutes, he felt relieved.\n[1963-11-01T13:48:00] Lina's house | I saw him pinch her cheek, wearing his usual sly smile. I heard they're married, and married couples don't split up. He promised Lina that the next Sunday he would take her to Amalfi Beach, where they could relax.\n[1963-11-01T13:49:00] Lina's house | I heard her, but she calmly replied that there was no reason for them to continue living together. They had been wrong from the beginning. When they got engaged, she had only liked him a little. Now she clearly knew she had never loved Stefano. She could no longer stand being supported by him, earning money for him, and sleeping with him.\n[1963-11-01T13:50:00] Lina's house | I saw her after she finished speaking, and Stefano slapped her, making her sit down. When Stefano came to grab her, she stood up and ran to the sink, grabbing the knife that was hidden under the cloth.\n[1963-11-01T13:51:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano about to hit her, and Lina pointed a knife at him. I heard her say to Stefano, \"Come on, I'll kill you just like they killed your father.\"\n[1963-11-01T13:52:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano stop, and he muttered, \"Come on, kill me. Do whatever you want.\" I thought about how he had suddenly become confused when he heard Lina mention his father's fate.\n[1963-11-01T13:53:00] Lina's house | I saw him make a very annoying gesture, letting out a long yawn—a yawn he couldn't hold back, his mouth wide open, tears even coming out. I saw something sparkling in her eyes.\n[1963-11-01T13:54:00] Lina's house | I saw him turn around, still muttering under his breath with dissatisfaction. He came to the table and ate another piece of dessert. \"I heard, 'Go on, go on. I've given you everything. I let you do whatever you wanted. I freed you from poverty. I made your brother, your father, your whole family rich. This is how you repay me? You really have no heart.'\"\n[1963-11-01T13:55:00] Lina's house | I saw him leave the kitchen and go into the bedroom; from the bedroom, he suddenly shouted. I heard, \"You can't even imagine how much I love you!\"\n[1963-11-01T13:56:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina place the knife on the edge of the sink. I thought to myself: \"He doesn't believe I would leave him, he also doesn't believe I have someone else, he just can't believe it.\"\n[1963-11-01T14:00:00] Lina's House | I saw that at this moment, she mustered the courage to go into the bedroom and confess about Nino, to tell him that she had become pregnant. I thought of her, but her husband was sleeping, as if suddenly put under a spell.",

    "text": "[1963-11-01T14:05:00] Lina's house | I saw her put on her coat, grab her luggage, and leave the house.\n[1963-11-01T14:10:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I later found out from her notes how much the night of her wedding had affected her. I thought about those people and things, their outlines and shapes dissolving and vanishing—this was Lina's greatest fear in life; among her family, she loved her older brother the most, and his twisted, deformed appearance terrified her. She was also frightened by the transformation that took place in him as Stefano changed from a boyfriend to a husband.\n[1963-11-01T14:15:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that she was especially afraid of waking up at night and seeing him transformed in bed into a bloated, almost ruptured mass of flesh, his skin peeling off, and everything around—furniture, the whole house, even herself, his wife—would also crack open and be swallowed by this filthy, repulsive creature. I thought about how she feared her husband's body was becoming twisted, feared that his inner desires, anger, and impulses were transforming him. Or perhaps the opposite was true—his twisting was because his heart had always been sinister, despicable, and cowardly.\n[1963-11-01T14:30:00] Mergellina | I saw the door close behind her, and she seemed to vanish into a white mist, invisible to others.\n[1963-11-01T15:00:00] Bookstore / Home | I saw myself studying hard again, especially at night, until the Christmas vacation. In the afternoons, I was busy in the bookstore. I thought about it, but I soon stopped thinking about it because I had a lot of problems to deal with: the bookstore, school, the teacher's questions, and the textbooks.\n[1963-11-01T15:30:00] Flegrey District | I saw her walk through some desolate streets and reach her destination—a third-floor apartment in a residential building. She entered a room that had two rooms, both in terrible condition, with old and broken furniture. The bathroom had only a toilet and a sink.\n[1963-11-01T15:40:00] Flagray District House | I know the house was chosen by her alone. Nino had to prepare for his exams, and he was also writing a new article for Il Messaggero, as well as revising a previous review. She looked at the house, rented it, and paid three months' rent in advance. I thought that now she had entered this house, and she felt very happy.\n[1963-11-01T15:45:00] House in the Flegrey District | I thought of her, and she was surprised to find that she had shaken off those things that had seemed destined to stick to her forever, and she felt a sense of pleasure—pleasure, yes, that's how she described it.\n[1963-11-01T15:50:00] Flagray District House | I saw that she couldn't smell the mildew in the room, couldn't see the mold spots forming in the corner of the bedroom, couldn't sense the dim light coming through the window. I thought about losing the comfortable life with the new Mergellina, and she didn't feel the least bit regretful.\n[1963-11-01T15:55:00] Flagray District House | I knew she had left the comfortable environment and returned to the impoverished one she had experienced in her childhood. I thought about her, but she didn't feel the least bit sad; she felt as if some magical spell had transported her from a place of pain to a place of happiness.\n[1963-11-01T16:00:00] House in Flegrey District | I thought to myself that at that moment, she must have experienced the pleasure of self-erasure, of vanishing from the world. She said goodbye to everything from her past—the old identity, the street, the shoes, Capodimonte, her husband, the Solara brothers, Piazza Martelli, and me—and began again in some entirely new place.\n[1963-11-01T16:05:00] House in the Flegrey District | I know that her only identity right now is that of Nino's lover, and Nino will arrive there in the evening.\n[1963-11-01T20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano sleep all day, and when he woke up, he found his wife wasn't at home. I thought about how he pretended nothing had happened, a posture he'd learned since childhood. When he was scared by his father—his father didn't even need to do anything, just appearing in front of him was enough to scare him.\n[1963-11-01T20:05:00] Lina's House | I thought about how, in order to face this fear, he had developed a shy smile and an unflappable attitude; he kept himself detached, on one hand suppressing his fear, and on the other hand, controlling the impulse to tear open her chest with his hands and pull out her heart.\n[1963-11-01T20:30:00] House in Flegrey District | I saw them start to make love. I knew it was the first time they had made love in the bed after that night at Mergellina.\n[1963-11-01T21:00:00] Mergellina | I saw him go out at night and do something very bold: he ran to the window of Pinocchia—the saleswoman—and called her several times. I saw Pinocchio's face, she looked happy but also uneasy. I know that he knows she's either at the movies or out on a date with Pasquale.\n[1963-11-01T21:10:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw that she didn't go out, so Stefano went up anyway. He spent the afternoon at Antonio's house, never once mentioning Lina. He talked politics with Pasquale and about Capodimonte with Pinochia. I knew that because Melina's illness was more severe than usual, Antonio had been away ever since he started working for the Solara brothers, and he wasn't around at regular times. At that time, her boyfriend Pasquale was keeping her company at home.\n[1963-11-01T22:00:00] Elena's House in Flegrey District | I saw that later, he got up and started studying, complaining that the light was too dim; she also got out of bed to help him review. They rechecked the article they had written for Il Messaggero together, and didn't embrace each other until after three in the morning.\n[1963-11-01T23:00:00] Lina's House | I saw him pretending that Lina had gone back to her parents' house when he got home. Before going to sleep, he carefully shaved his beard and slept soundly all night.\n[1963-11-01T23:05:00] House in the Flegrey District | I saw how fresh Nino's body was, tall and slender, so different from Stefano's, and his scent was so captivating. I thought about how she felt she came from a ghost-like world, and now had finally arrived at a real, living place.\n[1963-11-02 10:00:00] School | I saw that voice again the next day, the same time I caught a glimpse of Nino.\n[1963-11-02 10:00:10] School | I saw myself hidden in my feelings for Alfonso Carracci, following him closely whenever we went in and out of school. I thought I was scared.\n[1963-11-02 10:00:20] School | The moment I saw the guy I loved appear in my field of vision, I immediately ran to Don Achille's younger son, Alfonso Carracci, as if I had something very important to tell him.\n[1963-11-02 10:00:30] School | I saw us walking and talking, trying to stay away from Nino.\n[1963-11-02T07:00:00] House in the Flegrey District | I saw her feet touch the floor in the morning, and she had to immediately run to the bathroom to vomit. She closed the door so Nino wouldn't hear.\n[1963-11-02T09:00:00] Lina's house | I saw the salesperson at Martelli Square inform Michele that Lina hadn't come to work that morning; Michele called Stefano, who answered that his wife was sick and the illness might last for a while. I knew that the next day, things became very annoying.\n[1963-11-02T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew Lina had already sensed it: her brother and father would be pushed aside, the Solara brothers would take everything for themselves, Stefano would be led by the nose and become increasingly dependent on them. I thought that if it had happened at the beginning, this situation would have really annoyed her, but back then, she wrote in her notebook that she didn't care about any of it.\n[1963-11-02T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know, of course. Rino's situation worries her. His small boss position is about to collapse, which makes her sad, especially now that he's married and has a child. I thought that, in her eyes, all those past relationships had lost most of their significance. Emotionally, there was only one object in her heart—Nino—and she had focused all her attention on Nino.\n[1963-11-02T10:10:00] Mergellina | I thought that if all her previous efforts were aimed at making her brother rich, then all her current actions were meant to win Nino's favor.",

    "text": "[1963-11-02T18:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Nunzia come later to check if her daughter needed care, but no one opened the door. She came back after the store closed to check again. I saw Stefano just getting home from work, sitting in front of the TV with the volume turned up high.\n[1963-11-02T18:05:00] Lina's House | I saw him hear someone knocking at the door, curse under his breath, go open it, let Nunzia in, sit down, and then burst into tears. I heard Nunzia ask, \"How is Lina?\" He replied that Lina had left him.\n[1963-11-02T19:00:00] Lina's house | I saw both families had arrived: Stefano's mother, Alfonso Carracci, Rino, Fernando, Pinocchia, and her child. I thought they were all scared for different reasons, but only Maria and Nunzia truly worried about Lina's safety. They kept asking Lina where she had gone.\n[1963-11-02T19:10:00] Lina's house | I saw everyone arguing over reasons that had little to do with her. I heard that Rino and Fernando were both really angry with Stefano because he didn't do anything to stop the shoe factory from closing. They said he didn't understand Lina at all, sending her to work at the Solara brothers' store—what a terrible move.\n[1963-11-02T19:15:00] Lina's house | I saw Pinocchia very angry, shouting at her husband and father-in-law. I heard, \"Lina has always been crazy; she's not the victim, Stefano is.\"\n[1963-11-02T19:20:00] Lina's house | At this moment, Alfonso Carracci gathered his courage and said he would go to the police and check all the hospitals; everyone became even more excited, and they all turned against Alfonso Carracci as if he had offended them all. I heard, especially Rino, who said that if this got out, it would make the whole Mergellina laugh their heads off.\n[1963-11-02T19:25:00] Lina's house | I saw that this speculation was reasonable and gained everyone's approval, except for Alfonso Carracci. I heard Maria whisper at the end: \"She might have gone to see Elena.\"\n[1963-11-02T19:30:00] Lina's house | I saw they were still arguing, but everyone agreed that Lina had decided to go to Borgo because she couldn't stand Stefano and the Solara brothers. I heard \"Yes,\" Nunzia sighed, \"that's just how she is—when there's a problem, she always goes to Elena.\"\n[1963-11-02T19:35:00] Lina's house | I saw that from that moment on, everyone became angry about her recklessness, saying she took the train alone, left without saying goodbye to anyone, and went to such a distant place. I thought that, on the other hand, Lina's reasoning for coming to me was so convincing that everyone felt relieved, and then it seemed as though things were indeed that way.\n[1963-11-02T19:40:00] Lina's house | I saw it, but soon Pinocchio stopped me. I heard Alfonso Carracci say, \"Tomorrow I'll go out and look.\" Pinocchia said, \"You have to work, you can't leave.\" Fernando muttered, \"Let her be for a few days, let her calm down.\"\n[1963-11-03T09:00:00] Mergellina | The next day after Lina left, Pinocchia had to work in the old Capodimonte, take care of her whole family, her boyfriend, and also help Stefano clean his apartment and cook for him. I thought about how this had made Pasquale feel absolutely terrible.\n[1963-11-03T10:00:00] Mergellina | I heard that this was Stefano's answer to those who asked about Lina the next day: \"She went to Borgo to find Elena. She needs some rest.\"\n[1963-11-03T11:00:00] Martiri Square | I saw that Alfonso Carracci was immediately sent to work at Martiri Square to calm down the Solara brothers. I saw her leaving very early every morning, dressed as if she were going to a wedding. I thought he was comfortable there, and when he came back at night, he was also content. He liked working in the city center.\n[1963-11-03T14:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that that same afternoon, Nunzia became anxious. She found Alfonso Carracci and asked for my address. I thought about Alfonso Carracci not having my address, not having it at all, and besides my mother, no one had my address.\n[1963-11-03T15:00:00] My home | I saw Alfonso Carracci send Nunzia to find my mother, who gave Nunzia an incomplete address, or perhaps that was all she knew. I know my mother has a hard time writing, and we both know she won't be using the address I gave her. I thought about how my mother was naturally not very warm to anyone, or perhaps it was to protect me, letting me focus on my studies without getting distracted.\n[1963-11-03T16:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that, no matter what, Nunzia and Alfonso Carracci had written me a letter, both beating around the bush to ask if Lina was with me. I knew the address they wrote was Mask Loc 004 University, just my name and nothing else. By the time this letter arrived here, a long time had already passed. I thought about how I had read the letter, and Lina and Nino's actions made me even more angry. I didn't write back.\n[1963-11-05 16:00:00] Street | I thought that, in the end, it was a chaotic period, and I was especially eager to get close to Nino, but in reality I had stuck with Alfonso Carracci.\n[1963-11-05 16:00:10] Street | I saw it and I was very worried that Alfonso Carracci would get tired of me, that he might leave to find company elsewhere. I was always very enthusiastic toward him, and sometimes I even spoke to him in a very coquettish voice.\n[1963-11-05 16:00:20] Street | I saw it, but when I realized I might cause him to misunderstand, maybe even make him like me, I immediately changed my tone.\n[1963-11-05 16:00:30] Street | I thought, \"What if he misunderstands me and confesses his feelings?\" I was very worried.\n[1963-11-05 16:00:40] Street | I thought that if he confessed his feelings to me, even though it would be embarrassing, I would have to refuse him.\n[1963-11-05 16:00:50] Street | I thought of my peer Lina, who is already engaged to a mature man named Stefano. It would be very embarrassing for me to have a younger boy—Stefano's younger brother—as my boyfriend.\n[1963-11-05 16:01:00] Street | I thought about my wild imaginations, my mind filled with fantasies.\n[1963-11-05 16:01:10] South Avenue | I remember once, as I walked back along the Southern Avenue with Alfonso Carracci beside me, he walked like a loyal attendant, protecting me. I thought of ways to keep myself safe from the city's various dangers.\n[1963-11-05 16:01:20] South Avenue | I thought to myself that it was a beautiful thing that the two brothers from the Carachi family—Stefano and him—could protect me and Lina in different ways, keeping us away from the worst evils in the world.\n[1963-11-05 16:01:30] South Avenue | I thought about these crimes, including the first time me and Lina climbed the stairs leading to their house, and the fear we felt when we tried to get back the doll their father had stolen.\n[1963-11-05T10:00:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw her go to the shop on Martiri Square for the first time, to see how it could be renovated. I saw that what shocked her was the yellowed stain left on the wall after the board with her wedding photo had been burned.\n[1963-11-05T10:05:00] Martiri Square Store | I thought to myself: I don't like this place at all, I don't like the fact that there are still traces here of what happened before Nino came.\n[1963-11-05T10:06:00] Mergellina | I saw Michele glare at Antonio, and the meaning of that look was clear. I heard Michele answer, \"Start looking from Nino's eldest son.\" Then he said, \"If you tell anyone about me sending you to look for her, I'll have you sent to the Avellino asylum, and you'll never get out. Be smart, everything you see can only be told to me, understand?\"\n[1963-11-05T10:07:00] Mergellina | I saw Antonio nod.\n[1963-11-05T10:10:00] Martiri Square Store | I thought of her, and suddenly I remembered—for some inexplicable reason, the pivotal moments of her life always took place in this downtown area: here, many years ago, that night, they had clashed with young people on Thousand-Man Army Street, and it was then that she decided to escape poverty.\n[1963-11-05T10:15:00] Martiri Square Store | I know that here, she felt regret for her decision at the time. She had destroyed the wedding photo, hoping that this act of destruction and tearing would appear as a kind of decoration in the shop. It was right here, in this shoe store, that she discovered she had had a miscarriage. Here, now, her family's shoemaking business was coming to an end, to be absorbed by the Solara brothers. I thought that it was also here that her marriage would end, that she would tear off everything about Stefano from her body, his surname, and everything that came from him.\n[1963-11-05T10:20:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw her pointing at the burned marks on the wall and saying something to Michele, then she walked onto the sidewalk and looked at the stone lions in the central square. I heard, \"It's really ugly!\" I thought of those lions that made her afraid.\n[1963-11-10 10:00:00] School | I saw it naturally, and I spent the whole afternoon solving their problems. My study time became very limited, and twice I even skipped school. I knew the result wasn't very good for my first semester.\n[1963-11-10 10:00:10] School | I know that my Latin and Greek teacher was the highly respected Teacher Galiani, who cherished me. My grades in philosophy, chemistry, and mathematics were barely passing.\n[1963-11-10T09:00:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw her have the shop repainted; since the toilet had no windows, she had a previously sealed door leading to the courtyard opened up and fitted with frosted glass that let in a little light.\n[1963-11-10T09:05:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw her buy two paintings by an artist; she had seen them at the Città di Riga Gallery and liked them a lot. She hired a salesperson, but not from our Mergellina, but from a girl in the Martelli district, who had studied secretarial work.\n[1963-11-10T09:10:00] Martiri Square Store | I knew the store closed from one to four in the afternoon, giving her and the salesgirl plenty of rest and earning the girl's gratitude, as she had the boss's permission; she also had to be careful with Michele, because Michele blindly supported her reforms, but he wanted to know what she was doing and where she was spending the money.",

    "text": "[1963-11-10T10:00:00] Flegrey District | I knew their cohabitation lasted twenty-three days.\n[1963-11-10T10:05:00] District of Flegrey | I know she left her old life behind; she left the comfortable life she had after marriage, but she felt no regret at all. She left her parents, her brothers and sisters, Rino, and her little nephew, but she felt no sorrow. Her money would run out, but she didn't worry at all. I thought she was becoming increasingly at ease.\n[1963-11-10T10:10:00] Flegrey District | I would watch him when he was studying or writing, and they would have intense discussions. I thought the only thing she cared about was waking up and falling asleep with Nino, which would stir up a storm in her mind.\n[1963-11-10T20:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw them go out together at night, to the cinema, to book launches, or political debates; they often came home very late, walking hand in hand, either to keep warm or to avoid the rain, they laughed and teased each other as they walked.\n[1963-11-12T19:00:00] Lecture Hall | I once saw them go together to hear a lecture by a writer who also made films. His name was Pasolini. I know that everything related to him will cause controversy.\n[1963-11-12T19:05:00] Lecture Site | I saw that Nino didn't like him at all; he sneered and said. I heard, \"He's a sissy, likes to mess around, that's all.\"\n[1963-11-12T19:10:00] Lecture venue | I saw that he was reluctant to go, saying he preferred to study at home; but Lina was curious and pulled him out. I knew the place of that meeting, the same place where Teacher Galiani had asked me to attend an event, and I had taken Lina with me.\n[1963-11-12T20:00:00] Lecture Venue | I saw her, excited after the lecture, pulling Nino over to the author. She wanted to speak with Pasolini.\n[1963-11-12T20:10:00] Outside the lecture hall | I saw that Nino was somewhat anxious and tried every possible way to take her away. I saw, especially when he saw someone across the street shouting insults.\n[1963-11-12T20:11:00] Outside the lecture hall | I saw him saying worriedly. I heard, \"Let's go. I don't like him, and I don't like the Fascist molecule either.\"\n[1963-11-12T20:12:00] Outside the lecture hall | I saw that she didn't want to leave at all. Finally, Nino pulled her into an alley, but she broke free and laughed as she retorted at the people who were cursing her. I know Lina was raised in the midst of fights and brawls.\n[1963-11-12T20:15:00] Outside the lecture hall | I saw her quickly give in to Nino's wishes and leave, because when the fight started, she had seen Antonio among the people fighting.\n[1963-11-12T20:16:00] Outside the lecture hall | I saw his eyes and teeth were dazzling, like metal, different from others; he didn't scream. I thought she must have felt he was too absorbed in the fight to notice her, but this incident ruined their mood that evening.\n[1963-11-12T20:20:00] Outside the Lecture Venue | I saw him stop hitting, and when he saw Lina and Nino walking away, he followed them. I thought about how he had found where they were living, how he understood that they were now living together.\n[1963-11-12T21:00:00] On the way home | I saw that on the way home, her relationship with Nino had become strained: they had a major disagreement about something Pasolini had said. I thought that they must have gone to different places and listened to different people's dialoguees.\n[1963-11-12T21:10:00] On the way home | I thought it wasn't just that. From that night on, he began to miss the time they spent in the shop on Piazza Martiri, those hurried, exciting trysts, and at the same time, he felt that unsettling quality in Lina.\n[1963-11-12T21:15:00] On the way home | I saw that Lina had also noticed his impatience, so to prevent the situation from getting worse, I didn't tell him that among the people fighting, she had seen a friend of Mergellina — the son of Melina.\n[1963-11-13T10:00:00] Flegrey District | From that day on, I noticed that Nino was increasingly reluctant to take her out.\n[1963-11-13T10:05:00] District of Flegrey | I saw him say he wanted to study, which was true, but sometimes he couldn't help himself, and in public, she had once or twice gone too far. I heard, \"How over the top is that?\" \"You're always so dramatic.\" \"That means what?\"\n[1963-11-13T10:10:00] Flegrey District | I saw him listing a series of things with resentment. I heard, \"When you argue, your voice is too loud. When others tell you to speak softly, you immediately start fighting with them. It's inappropriate to talk to the person giving a lecture while talking to yourself. You shouldn't do that.\"\n[1963-11-13T10:15:00] District of Flegre | I thought that Lina knew she shouldn't have done it, but she was certain that with Nino, everything was possible, including bridging the distance between people and having conversations with important figures.\n[1963-11-13T10:20:00] District of Flegrey | I know that in the shoe store on Sorrento, she often deals with important people, doesn't she? How else could he have published his first article on Il Messaggero, if not through one of her clients? What does it matter then?\n[1963-11-13T10:25:00] Flegrey District | I saw her [intimate act] with him. I heard her say, \"You're too shy,\" to him, \"You don't understand, you have to be better than them, the things you do are more important than theirs.\"\n[1963-11-13T10:30:00] Flegrey District | I saw that he had gotten stuck in this dead end and couldn't get out, which caused his illness to return. I saw, especially the problem with his hands; now he keeps crossing his fingers and holding them together, as if praying.\n[1963-11-15 10:00:00] Classroom | I saw our religious teacher relentlessly attacking Communist Party, criticizing secularism. I thought I felt the need to respond.\n[1963-11-15 10:00:10] Classroom | I thought, I don't know, whether this was out of feeling for Pasquale, since he had always claimed to be Communist Party, or whether I just felt that the priest's accusations about Communist Party were all directed at me, and his arrows even pointed at Professor Galiani—a typical Communist Party.\n[1963-11-15 10:00:20] Classroom | I saw that at this moment I raised my hand. I heard myself say that I had taken a correspondence course in theology, and it was obvious that humans were still in a state of blindness and complacency, handing themselves over to God, to Jesus, or to the Holy Spirit.\n[1963-11-15 10:00:30] Classroom | I heard her say, \"This last one is completely unnecessary, just there to make up the trinity. The Holy Spirit is actually superior to the Father and the Son—like when the whole city is burning in hellfire, we're still collecting and worshiping the paintings.\"\n[1963-11-15 10:00:40] Classroom | I saw him timidly tug at my blouse. I thought of Alfonso Carracci and immediately realized I had said too much.\n[1963-11-15 10:00:50] Classroom | I saw that I didn't let him speak, and I kept talking until the very conclusion.\n[1963-11-15 10:01:00] Classroom | I saw it like that, and for the first time, I was sent out of the classroom by the teacher. I knew that I had been marked in the class performance record.\n[1963-11-15 10:02:00] Corridor | I saw myself arriving on the corridor. I thought back to the beginning, when I felt so lost: What had happened? Why had I acted so recklessly? Where had that absolute certainty come from, the feeling that what I said was right, worth saying?\n[1963-11-15 10:02:10] Corridor | I thought about it until I remembered that I had said those words to Lina. I realized that I had made such a mistake because I felt her opinion was so authoritative, giving me enough strength to challenge the religious teacher.\n[1963-11-15 10:02:20] Corridor | I thought about Lina no longer reading, no longer studying, she was about to become the wife of Capodimonte's boss, and might soon replace Stefano's mother, sitting behind the checkout counter.\n[1963-11-15 10:02:30] Corridor | What about me? I drew strength from her and came up with this image: portraying religion as a collection of images of people, while the entire city was being burned by hellfire. So, school was something entirely my own, long removed from her influence — that's not true at all!\n[1963-11-15 10:02:40] Corridor | I saw myself at the classroom door, thinking about these things, silently crying.\n[1963-11-15 10:03:00] Corridor | I saw things suddenly change, and Nino appeared at the far end of the corridor.\n[1963-11-15 10:03:10] Corridor | I felt renewed when I saw him at this critical moment, and hurriedly wiped away my tears. After meeting his father in Mergellina, I became even more determined to act as if he didn't exist.\n[1963-11-15 10:03:20] Corridor | I saw him coming towards me. I thought he must have noticed my strange behavior.\n[1963-11-15 10:03:30] Corridor | I saw him taller, his Adam's apple stood out prominently, his face had sharp contours, and he was beginning to grow fine whiskers. His gaze was more determined.\n[1963-11-15 10:03:40] Corridor | I realized this time I couldn't avoid him anymore. I couldn't go into the classroom, nor could I head toward the restroom; both options would only complicate my situation further—if the religion teacher popped his head out to check.\n[1963-11-15 10:03:50] Corridor | I saw that I could only stay there, he stopped in front of me and asked why I was outside and what had happened.\n[1963-11-15 10:04:00] Corridor | I told him the whole story, and his brow furrowed. I heard someone say to me, \"I'll be back soon.\"\n[1963-11-15 10:08:00] Corridor | I saw him appear a few minutes later, together with Professor Galiani.\n[1963-11-15 10:08:10] Corridor | I saw Professor Galiani praising me. \"I heard her say, 'But now,' as if giving a lecture to both me and Nino, 'after the attack, we need to make amends.'\"\n[1963-11-15 10:08:20] Corridor | I saw her knock on the door of my classroom, then go inside and close it behind her.\n[1963-11-15 10:13:00] Corridor | I saw her five minutes later. I saw a face full of smiles.\n[1963-11-15 10:13:10] Corridor | I realized I could go back into the classroom if I apologized to the teacher, because my tone had been too authoritarian.",

    "text": "[1963-11-15 10:15:00] Classroom | I saw the teacher apologize. I felt a mix of sorrow and joy in my heart: on one hand, I was anxious because the religious teacher might punish me again; on the other hand, I felt proud because Nino and Teacher Galiani were supporting me.\n[1963-11-15 16:00:00] Posillipo | I was very careful and didn't tell my parents what had happened.\n[1963-11-15 20:00:00] By the pond | I told Antonio everything, and he proudly told Pasquale.\n[1963-11-15T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew she had chosen to work at Martiri Square, which made her more isolated from us at Mergellina than ever before. I thought about what people would say: a girl who had married well, going from nothing to a life of wealth; a beautiful girl who could have been the mistress of her own home, managing her husband's business. Why would she get up early and go to the city center to work all day, as someone else's employee, making her husband's life more complicated, and making her aging mother-in-law work hard in the new house?\n[1963-11-15T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Pinocchia and Giggia were especially upset; they did everything they could to smear her, which was obvious.\n[1963-11-15T10:10:00] Mergellina | What I saw was unexpected: Pinocchia's attitude. She had always been grateful to Lina, because Lina had taken care of her all along. But just as Lina left Capodimonte, she cut all ties with her. I thought of myself as suddenly pulling my hand back in front of a beast's claws; she felt betrayed because she couldn't adapt to the sudden shift from friend and colleague to a servant for Stefano's mother.\n[1963-11-15T12:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her, but she could only leave things to fate; at first, she even discussed it with her boyfriend Enzo, but Enzo didn't approve of Pinocchia's harsh attitude. He still shook his head in his usual concise way and said a few words. I heard Pinocchia say angrily, \"No matter what I do, it's wrong, but whatever she does is always right.\" \"Who said that?\" \"You. You're always talking about how Lina thinks, how Lina acts, how Lina knows what she's doing. And what about me? She left me here all alone, and just walked away! Of course, it's good that she left, so I shouldn't complain, right? That's what you think, isn't it?\" \"No.\"\n[1963-11-15T12:05:00] Mergellina | I saw that, rather than defending Lina, he was asserting his own position: he was always right, and that was beyond question. I thought that even though he was concise, saying only \"yes\" or \"no,\" Pinocchia still couldn't let it go; she was in great pain.\n[1963-11-15T12:10:00] Mergellina | I know that since his father's death, and since he returned from the army, he has been doing what he was supposed to do, living the same life as before. But while he was in the army, he had already started studying at night, not knowing what kind of certificate he was trying to get. I thought about how she felt that Enzo was tired of everything, including her, which made her even angrier; now he was locked in his own world, roaring like a wild beast—roaring inside, but silent on the outside. Pinocchia could no longer stand him, especially because when the subject of that bad woman came up, he would get somewhat agitated.\n[1963-11-15T12:15:00] Mergellina | I saw her crying and shouting at Enzo. I heard her say, \"Lina is just disgusting. She doesn't care about anyone at all. I know you like that about her. But if I acted like her, you'd tear my face off.\"\n[1963-11-15T20:00:00] Flegrey District | I saw it, but in the following few nights, he always made various excuses to go out alone; he studied at home, always complaining that the building was too noisy, or he would sigh and say he had to go ask his father for money again.\n[1963-11-15T21:00:00] Flegrey District | I saw his father asking him a series of questions: Where do you live? What are you doing? Are you studying? I thought, or rather, when faced with Lina's ability to connect things that were far apart, he didn't show his usual enthusiasm but shook his head, becoming very impatient.\n[1963-11-18 10:00:00] Street | I told Lina about the day I saw Pasquale meeting Lina, how he had clung to me like a lifeline. I thought about how he still loved her, how at that moment he couldn't control his passion and didn't know what to say to her.\n[1963-11-20 10:00:00] School | I thought like that, and in the blink of an eye, I became a hero among my friends—not just a few of them, but a whole group of enthusiastic teachers and students who united to oppose the religious teacher's sermons.\n[1963-11-20 10:00:10] School | I realized then that apologizing to the priest wasn't enough—I needed to gain his trust, as well as that of other teachers who shared his views.\n[1963-11-20 10:00:20] School | I saw that I effortlessly separated what I said from who I was. I thought about how I had shown my teachers, who were hostile toward me, a cooperative, respectful, diligent, and helpful attitude. They soon forgave my strange views and came to see me as a promising student.\n[1963-11-20 10:00:30] School | I thought like that, and I found that I could be as calm as Teacher Galiani: I could confidently express my own opinions, while gaining everyone's respect through impeccable conduct.\n[1963-11-20 10:00:40] School | I thought that in just a few days, I felt as if I and Nino had become the two most promising students in this run-down high school.\n[1963-11-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that Pinocchia had always been a loyal supporter of Stefano, after all, Stefano was her boss, and she constantly accused her boss's wife of behaving improperly. I knew that when Lina went to the city center and became a salesgirl in that luxurious shop, Pinocchia grew even more cruel.\n[1963-11-20T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw her say bad things about Lina to everyone, sharp-tongued and unashamed, but she was especially angry with Antonio and Pasquale. I heard her say, \"She tricked all of you, you men.\" She said, \"Because she knows your psychology, she's just a prostitute.\"\n[1963-11-20T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw her speaking like that, full of anger, as if Antonio and Pasquale represented all men, and all men were the same; she would curse her own brother because he wasn't on her side. I heard her shouting, \"Shut up, because you also take money from Solara, you're all their company people. I know, you obey a woman, you're renovating her store. She tells you to move this and move that, and you do exactly as she says.\"\n[1963-11-20T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw that her behavior was even worse in front of her boyfriend Pasquale, and their conflicts grew bigger and bigger. She often cursed and scolded, and Pasquale apologized to her, saying he had just finished working and hadn't had time to take a shower yet. I heard her say to Pasquale, \"You're too dirty, both dirty and stinky.\"\n[1963-11-20T10:20:00] Mergellina | I saw that Bambino would only become more ruthless and unyielding in his words, never letting him off the hook at any time. I knew that Pasquale, in order to have a calmer life, had to make a concession on the issue of Lina; otherwise, they might break up.\n[1963-11-20T22:00:00] Flegrey District | I watched for a while; his mood was so bad, his exam results so far behind, that in order to continue studying, he no longer slept with her in [intimate] ways.\n[1963-11-20T22:05:00] District of Flegrey | I heard Lina say, \"It's too late, let's go to sleep.\" She would casually reply, \"Go to sleep, I'll be there in a minute.\"\n[1963-11-20T22:10:00] Flagray District | I saw him looking at the curves of her body beneath the quilt. I thought about how he longed for the warmth of the bed, but he was also afraid.\n[1963-11-20T22:15:00] Flegrey District | I thought: I haven't graduated yet, I don't have a job; if I don't want to waste my life, I need to work twice as hard; but now I'm with a married woman who's pregnant, and every morning she throws up, disrupting my routine.\n[1963-11-23T10:00:00] Flegrey District | I saw how he feltpainful when he found out that Il Messaggero would not publish his article.\n[1963-11-23T10:05:00] Flegrey District | I saw Lina comfort him and suggest that he submit the article to another newspaper. I heard her add at the end, \"I'll call and ask tomorrow.\"\n[1963-11-23T10:10:00] Flegrey District | I saw her about to call the editor she'd met at the Solara shoe store to find out what was wrong; he sighed and said. I heard, \"Don't call anyone.\" \"Why?\" \"Because that lousy guy never showed any interest in me, and he's the same with you.\" \"That's not true.\"\n[1963-11-23T10:11:00] Flegrey District | I heard, \"That's really the case, I'm not an idiot, you only get me into trouble.\" \"What do you want to say?\" \"I shouldn't have listened to you.\" \"What exactly did I do?\"",

Choose something you like, go back and sell shoes, sell sausages, but don't think you can become someone else and drag me in too.\"\n[1963-11-23T10:14:00] Flegrey District | I know they have been living together for twenty-three days. I thought of them as if the gods had wrapped them in a mist, hiding them from the world, letting them enjoy each other undisturbed.\n[1963-11-23T10:15:00] Flegrey District | I saw these words hurting her deep inside, and I said to Nino. I heard \"Get out!\"\n[1963-11-23T10:16:00] Flegrey District | I saw him angrily throw his coat over his sweater and slam the door as he left.\n[1963-11-23T10:30:00] Flegrey District | I saw his books, his notes, and his razor and soap here. I thought of Lina sitting on the bed, thinking: He'll be back here in ten minutes.\n[1963-11-23T10:40:00] Flegrey District | I saw her crying in the end. I wondered how I could have thought about living with him, about helping him? It was my fault. I freed my mind, and I made him write things he shouldn't have.\n[1963-11-23T11:00:00] Nino's house | I know the thing I'm about to tell is something I've heard from different people at different times, so I'll start with Nino.\n[1963-11-23T11:30:00] Nino's house | After I saw Nino leave the house in the Ferra area, I hid at his parents' house; his mother was very kind to him, she was simply too good for this wayward son of hers.\n[1963-11-23T12:00:00] Nino's house | I saw it, but less than an hour had passed before he started arguing with his father, cursing and swearing; Donato shouted at him in dialect. I heard him say either he leaves home or stays, but he shouldn't just casually leave for a month without even saying goodbye. He comes back only to get money, as if the money were his own.\n[1963-11-23T12:30:00] Nino's house | I saw Nino slip into his room, and he stayed there for a long time. I thought that although he wanted to immediately return to Lina's side, beg for her forgiveness, and tell Lina how much he loved her, he reconsidered his situation and was certain he had fallen into a trap—not his fault, nor Lina's, but the fault of desire.\n[1963-11-23T12:35:00] Nino's House | I thought to myself: For example, right now, I can't wait to return to her, constantly touching her, taking on my responsibility; but reason tells me that what I did today, when I was completely disappointed, was right—Lina and I aren't compatible!\n[1963-11-23T12:40:00] Nino's house | I thought about Lina's pregnancy, the child in her belly frightened me; I should go find Bruno and ask him for some money, I should leave San Gregorio Armeno like Elena did, to study somewhere else.\n[1963-11-23T23:59:00] Flegrey District | I saw her lying in bed waiting. She had waited all night, but Nino didn't come back until the next day—and he never came back at all.\n[1963-11-24T20:00:00] Nino's house | I thought about him all night, and the whole next day. On one hand, I felt I really couldn't do without Lina, but on the other hand, I was scared, because I remembered her rude and shameless behavior, her ignorant cleverness, and her thoughts—bold ideas, ones I didn't know how she came up with.\n[1963-11-24T21:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that he was having trouble controlling himself; that night he called Bruno and said he wanted to go out to find him. I saw that it was raining.\n[1963-11-24T21:05:00] Mergellina | I knew that Michele hadn't sent him to beat Nino's son, and that was exactly the case: he hadn't told Michele the essential part of the story, and he had no reason to do so. I thought about beating Nino, it was his own decision. He took some time to make it because he wanted Nino to leave Lina and return to her the things she had discarded.\n[1963-11-24T21:10:00] Mergellina | I thought about how she had given up her old life, something he could never understand; he hit Nino to take his revenge, because he really hated Nino—a worthless pretty boy, a frail, thin figure who had managed to make both of us girls, past and present, so completely infatuated.\n[1963-11-24T21:30:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him run to the bus stop and get on the bus before it started moving, but suddenly he changed his mind and got off at Garibaldi Square.\n[1963-11-24T22:00:00] On the way to the Flagray District | I saw him take the subway to the Flegre district. I thought about how he was eager to embrace Lina, to take her right there, the moment he walked in the door, against the wall at the entrance—this was the most urgent thing, and the rest could wait.\n[1963-11-24T22:15:00] Flagray District Street | I saw him walking swiftly through the rain, not noticing that someone was coming straight toward him. I saw that the sky was very dark.\n[1963-11-24T22:16:00] Flagray District Street | I saw him get violently pushed, thrown to the ground, and then the man began to kick and punch him relentlessly.\n[1963-11-24T22:17:00] Flagray District Street | I saw the person hitting him speaking to him constantly, but there was no anger in his voice. I heard, \"Leave her, never see her again, never touch her again. Say quickly: I'm leaving her, I'll never see her again, never touch her again. You bastard! You scum! You like it? Ah! You like messing with other people's wives. Say it: I'm sorry, I'm leaving her.\"\n[1963-11-24T22:18:00] Flagray District Street | I saw Nino obediently saying those words, but the man who was beating him didn't stop. I thought it was not so much because of the pain as because of fear that he lost consciousness.\n[1963-11-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that Antonio was the one who beat Nino, but about this matter, he didn't utter a single word to his boss.\n[1963-11-25T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Michele ask him if he had found Nino's son, and he said he had. I heard when Michele asked anxiously, following this lead, whether they had found Lina, and he said no.\n[1963-11-25T10:10:00] Mergellina | I heard Michele ask him if he had any news about Lina, and he said Lina still hadn't been found. The only thing that was absolutely certain was that Nino's son had absolutely nothing to do with Mrs. Carracci.\n[1963-11-25T10:15:00] Mergellina | I knew, of course, that he was lying. In fact, he had found Nino and Lina very soon, by a very fortunate coincidence.\n[1963-11-25T15:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that they no longer treated him as a friend, and they reluctantly met with him, especially Pasquale, even though Pasquale was engaged to Antonio's sister and was about to become his brother-in-law.\n[1963-11-25T15:05:00] Mergellina | I saw that Antonio no longer cared about their attitude. He had sold himself to the Solara brothers. He pretended nothing was wrong, pretending their hostility was merely annoying, not threatening their friendship.\n[1963-11-25T15:10:00] Mergellina | I heard him not mention Nino, he just said he'd found Lina and that she needed help. \"What are we supposed to do for her?\" Pasquale said in an annoyed tone.\n[1963-11-25T15:11:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"Help her get home: she didn't go to Elena, she's living in a really run-down place in the Flegrei district.\" \"Is she living alone?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why would she do that?\" \"I don't know, I haven't spoken to her.\"\n[1963-11-25T15:12:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"Why?\" \"It was Michele who told me to find her.\" \"You're a piece of dog shit, Fascist!\"\n[1963-11-25T15:13:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"I'm no one, I just finished a job.\" \"Good, what do you want us to do now?\" \"I didn't tell Michele that I found her.\"\n[1963-11-25T15:14:00] The Old Library | \"I heard 'Then what?' 'I don't want to lose my job, I need to earn money. If Michele finds out I lied to him, he'll fire me. Go find her and bring her home.'\"",

    "text": "[1963-11-25T15:15:00] Mergellina | I saw Pasquale curse him again, saying very harsh things, but in this situation, Antonio didn't retaliate. I heard his future brother-in-law Pasquale say that Lina left her husband and everything else, and eventually left the Solara shoe store, because she realized marrying Stefano had been a mistake, and she was right to do so, of course he wouldn't go and get her back.\n[1963-11-25T15:16:00] Mergellina | At that moment, I saw Antonio getting a bit excited. \"I heard 'You want to leave her alone in the Fratelli district?' \" Antonio asked uneasily, \"alone, and without any money?\"\n[1963-11-25T15:17:00] Mergellina | \"I heard, 'Why, are we rich people? Lina is an adult, she knows how to live. She made this choice, and she always has her own reasons. We shouldn't bother her.' 'Every time we need help, she always steps in.'\"\n[1963-11-25T15:18:00] Mergellina | I saw that Lina had given money to everyone and offered help, and Pasquale looked a bit embarrassed. I heard him mutter something about the rich and the poor, and the situation of women inside and outside Mergellina. He said he'd be willing to pay some if it came to that.\n[1963-11-25T15:19:00] Mergellina | I saw but Enzo— he had been silent all along, and with an impatient gesture he cut off Pasquale's words, then asked Antonio. I heard, \"Give me your address, I'll go ask her what she really thinks.\"\n[1963-11-25T15:30:00] The Old Library | I saw that when he decided to go find Lina, he told Pasquale and Antonio, but it wasn't a matter of discussing it with them. He simply and clearly stated his decision. I thought there was no room for discussion.\n[1963-11-26T09:00:00] On the way to the Flagray District | I saw that the next day he actually went. He took the subway, got off in the Flegre district, found the street and the gate of the house.\n[1963-11-26T09:05:00] Mergellina | I know that during that time, I knew nothing about Enzo. His life wasn't going well at all; everything was unbearable for him: his mother was always complaining and moaning, his younger brother and sister needed to be taken care of, the black market in the vegetable stall was extorting him, he had to push his cart around outside shouting for business, his earnings were getting less and less, Pasquale's endless talk about Communist Party, and his relationship with Pinochia—all of it annoyed him.\n[1963-11-26T09:10:00] Mergellina | I know, but his personality is very reserved, making it hard to guess what kind of person he really is; from Pinochia, I learned that he was studying in secret, hoping to obtain a certificate in industrial management through self-taught exams.\n[1963-11-26T09:15:00] Flegrey District | I felt no unease when I saw him go to the Fratelli district.\n[1963-11-26T09:20:00] House in the Flegrey District | I saw him find the path and the gate, he climbed the stairs and knocked on the door with great determination.\n[1963-11-26T10:00:00] Flagray District House | I saw that after ten minutes, after an hour, and even the next day, Nino didn't return and had vanished without a trace. I knew Lina's mood had turned terrible; she didn't feel abandoned, but rather insulted.\n[1963-11-26T10:10:00] Flagray District House | I know that she herself also admitted she wasn't suitable for Nino, but she couldn't stand it: he disappeared from her life just twenty-three days later, in a way that was unbearable and certainly confirmed it.\n[1963-11-26T10:30:00] Elena's House in Flegrey District | I saw her, in a fit of anger, throw away everything he had left behind: books, underpants, socks, sweaters, even a pencil stub; after she did it, she felt extremely regretful and started crying again. I thought I had finally finished crying, and she felt very ugly, her face swollen and foolish.\n[1963-11-26T11:00:00] Flagray District House | I thought of her, and my heart ached. She thought of Nino—the Nino she loved, the Nino who loved her, the one who made her suffer these pains.\n[1963-11-26T11:10:00] Flagray District House | I saw the house suddenly reveal its true face—it was a very dilapidated house, and through its walls I could hear the noise of the entire city; she smelled a terrible odor, saw cockroaches crawling in under the door, and noticed mold spots forming on the ceiling. I thought of how she first felt the experience of her childhood once again seizing her—not the imaginative, dreamy childhood, but that sorrowful, brutal one, filled with threats and violence.\n[1963-11-26T11:20:00] House in the Flegrey District | I thought of her, but suddenly she realized that the fantasy she had always turned to for comfort—the dream of becoming rich—had already vanished from her mind.\n[1963-11-26T11:30:00] Flagray District House | I know that the poverty she endured in the Frazione district was even darker than the one I experienced in our Mergellina during childhood. Despite her situation being worsened by her [pregnancy status], and despite the fact that she had spent all her money within just a few days. I thought about how she had realized that wealth was not a reward, nor a bargaining chip; for her, it had lost any meaning.\n[1963-11-26T11:40:00] House in the Flegrey District | I know that safe we dreamed of as children, filled with gold coins and jewels, was later replaced by the dirty, smelly money—those were the coins in the drawer where she worked at Capodimonte, or the money in the colorful metal boxes in the shoe store on Piazza Martiri. I realized this fantasy had already lost its power and no longer held any allure for her.\n[1963-11-26T11:50:00] Flagray District House | I realized that her possession of money and material things had completely disappointed her; she wanted nothing from herself, and nothing for the child in her belly.\n[1963-11-26T12:00:00] Flagray District House | I thought that for her, wealth had meant having Nino, and now that Nino was gone, she felt poor, a kind of poverty money could not erase.\n[1963-11-26T12:10:00] Flagray District House | I thought about her current situation, which could not be compensated by anything—she had made too many mistakes since childhood, and all of them led to this final mistake: she believed that Nino's son couldn't do without her, and she couldn't do without him either. Their fates would be different, but they would always love each other, and nothing else would be needed besides their love.\n[1963-11-26T12:20:00] Flagray District House | I realized I had been wrong, and I decided never to go out again, never to look for him, never to eat anything again, just to wait until my consciousness faded away, slowly disappearing along with my child. I thought of her, until her mind was completely empty, not even a single thing left to make her furious, meaning she would completely give up on herself!\n[1963-11-26T12:30:00] Flagray District House | I was watching when someone knocked on the door.\n[1963-11-26T12:31:00] House in the Flegrey District | I thought it was Nino, so I opened the door, but it was Enzo instead. I thought of seeing Enzo, and she wasn't disappointed.\n[1963-11-26T12:32:00] Flagray District House | I thought about how she was expecting him to bring her some fruit, just like many years ago, when they were children, during the competition organized by the principal and Teacher Oliviero, when he had been defeated and then hit Lina on the forehead with a stone.\n[1963-11-26T12:33:00] House in the Flegrey District | I saw her laughing, and Enzo thought her laughter was a sick reaction.\n[1963-11-26T12:35:00] Flagray District House | I saw him come in, but out of respect, I left the door open. He didn't want the neighbors to think she was a prostitute.\n[1963-11-26T12:36:00] Elena's House in Flegrey District | I saw him look around, see her defeated state, and though he hadn't yet realized the thing that wasn't yet apparent—she was pregnant—but he guessed that she really needed help.\n[1963-11-26T12:37:00] House in the Flegrey District | I saw him still speaking in that serious way, without any emotion, before she stopped laughing, he said. I heard, \"Let's go.\" \"Where to?\" \"Back to your husband.\"",

I heard, \"I'll tell her, and she'll leave you.\" \"I'll tell her myself, I've already made up my mind.\"\n[1963-11-26T12:42:00] House in the Flegrey District | I saw her respond to him in a very improper tone, laughing as she spoke. I thought, as they say, not a single word is true; they are talking about worlds, people, and emotions that have been gone for a long time.\n[1963-11-26T12:45:00] Flagray District House | I saw Enzo realize it. He was silent for a moment, then he walked around the room, found Lina's suitcase, and started taking things from the drawers and wardrobe and putting them into the suitcase.\n[1963-11-26T12:50:00] Flagray District House | I saw Lina letting him do all those things. I thought that because she felt Enzo in front of her wasn't a real person at all, but more like a shadow, just like in a movie, and even though he was speaking, it was only the effect of light.\n[1963-11-26T12:55:00] Flagray District House | I saw him finish packing his luggage and then approach her. He said something that surprised her, in that cold but forceful way he had. \"I heard 'Lina, I love you, I've loved you since we were little. But I've never told you because you're beautiful and smart, while I'm short and ugly, too small to be worthy of you.'\"\n[1963-11-26T12:56:00] House in the Flegrey District | I heard, \"Now, go back to your husband. I don't know why you left him, and I don't want to know. All I know is that you can't stay here, you shouldn't live in this terrible environment.\"\n[1963-11-26T12:57:00] Flagray District House | \"I heard, 'I'll walk with you to your building's entrance and wait for you. If he treats you badly, I'll go up and kill him; if he doesn't hit you and is happy you're back, then it's okay. We've made an agreement: if you can't get along with your husband, I'll take you back and bring you away. Okay?'\"\n[1963-11-26T12:58:00] Flagray District House | I saw Lina stop smiling, she squinted her eyes, it was the first time she had listened to him so intently.\n[1963-11-26T13:00:00] Elena's House in Flegrey District | I knew that by then, the connection between Lina and him was very weak, but whenever I was there, I always felt amazed. I thought there was something hard to explain between them, a vague thing that had existed since childhood; I felt she trusted Enzo, and she saw him as a reliable person.\n[1963-11-26T13:05:00] Flagray District House | I saw her hesitate when Enzo picked up his luggage and walked toward the open door, then followed him.\n[1963-11-26T20:00:00] Lina's building downstairs | I saw the night Enzo walked Lina home, and he was really waiting under Lina and Stefano's window. I thought that if Stefano hit her, I would most likely go up and kill Stefano.\n[1963-11-26T20:10:00] Lina's house | I saw that Stefano didn't hit her; the opposite happened. I saw that a clean, neat, and comfortable house was waiting for her.\n[1963-11-26T20:15:00] Lina's house | I saw his reaction as if his wife had really gone to Borgo and stayed with me for a while, even though there was no evidence that it had actually happened.\n[1963-11-26T20:20:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina, she didn't use that excuse, nor did she come up with any other.\n[1963-11-27T08:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her reluctantly say to Stefano the next morning when I got up. I heard, \"I've given birth.\"\n[1963-11-27T08:01:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano was very happy; when she spoke her second sentence, he laughed, as if it was a genuine joy from within. I heard, \"The child isn't yours.\"\n[1963-11-27T08:02:00] Lina's house | I saw her repeat the sentence two or three times, her voice growing increasingly angry. She also clenched her fists and hit Stefano. He came over to comfort her, [intimate gesture]. I heard a soft voice say, \"Don't do this, Lina! Don't do this, don't do this, I'm so happy. I know I've been bad to you, let's not fight now, don't say these things to me.\"\n[1963-11-27T08:03:00] Lina's house | I saw happiness in his eyes, tears of joy.\n[1963-11-27T08:05:00] Lina's House | I had always known that Lina understood people lied to protect themselves from the pain of the truth, but what surprised her was that her husband could deceive himself with such a cheerful attitude.\n[1963-11-27T08:10:00] Lina's House | I saw her, but she no longer cared—didn't care about Stefano, didn't care about herself. After repeating several times, \"The child isn't yours,\" she sank into the numbness and sluggishness of pregnancy.\n[1963-11-27T08:15:00] Lina's house | I thought to myself, Stefano doesn't want to suffer now, okay! Let him feel whatever he wants to feel. If he doesn't want to suffer now, then let him suffer later.\n[1963-11-27T10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her start to say what she wanted to do and what she didn't want to do. I thought she no longer wanted to work at the store on Martirini Square, nor in Capodimonte; she didn't want to see anyone, not relatives or friends, especially the Solara brothers; she wanted to stay home and be a full-time wife and mother.\n[1963-11-27T10:10:00] Lina's house | I saw that he agreed. I thought he wouldn't be able to hold out for more than a few days, and Lina would change her mind.\n[1963-12-01 10:00:00] Posillipo | I was thinking about the argument I told you about, just to explain how that year passed.\n[1963-12-01 10:00:10] Posillipo | I thought I should explain the atmosphere surrounding Lina's choices, especially the attitudes of the men who had once been infatuated with her or had confessed their love to her.\n[1963-12-01 10:00:20] Posillipo | I thought about how they had loved her, longed for her, and it was very likely they still did.\n[1963-12-01 10:00:30] Posillipo | I thought that no matter what the situation, I would defend Lina, and I liked doing it, liked speaking about it in that pedantic, authoritative tone.\n[1963-12-01 10:00:40] Posillipo | I thought about it, but I also knew that I was quite willing to tell the story of what had happened before, even exaggerating it, saying how Lina had been manipulating Stefano's actions behind the scenes.\n[1963-12-01 10:00:50] Posillipo | I thought about how to tell the story of how we gradually solved that problem, like solving a math equation, until we arrived at this result: settling ourselves, taking care of my brother, and beginning to realize the plan for the shoe factory.\n[1963-12-01T08:00:00] On the street | I saw that up until that time, Pasquale often yelled at his girlfriend and sister, saying they had forgotten the favors Lina had done for them. I want to point out one thing: the matter didn't end there.\n[1963-12-01T08:05:00] Street | I didn't realize until one morning when I saw Lina sitting in Michele's \"Juliet\" sports car. I saw our friend heavily made up, dressed like a high-class prostitute, as Michele drove her to Martiri Square.\n[1963-12-01T08:10:00] Street | I thought about how Pasquale had admitted he no longer understood the situation. Lina didn't have to worry about making a living; why had she sold herself to a man like him?!\n[1963-12-01T10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw, but in fact, Lina stayed at home all along. I thought about how she didn't care at all about Stefano's business, nor about her brother and father's shoe factory, nor about what happened to her husband and her own relatives.\n[1963-12-05 10:00:00] School | A few weeks later, when Nino saw me, he got straight to the point, using his usual gloomy tone, and asked me to write a half-page report detailing my conflict with the priest.\n[1963-12-05 10:00:10] School | I heard, \"What's it for?\"\n[1963-12-05 10:00:20] School | I heard him say that he was editing a small magazine called \"San Gregorio Armeno: The Poor Man's Hotel.\" I know he mentioned it at the editorial office, and several editors told him that if he could write a brief summary, they might try to include it in the next issue of the magazine.\n[1963-12-05 10:00:30] School | I saw him glance at the magazine for me. I saw it was a booklet of about fifty pages, with a dark gray cover. The table of contents included his name and an article of his titled \"Miserable Data.\"\n[1963-12-05 10:00:40] School | I thought of this, and I thought of his father, who had read the article published in the newspaper with a satisfied and self-satisfied expression on the beach at Maronti.\n[1963-12-05 10:00:50] School | \"I also write poetry?\" I asked him.\n[1963-12-05 10:01:00] School | I saw him look at me with contempt and deny it. I immediately agreed with him. I heard, \"Okay, I'll try.\"\n[1963-12-05 14:00:00] Street | I rushed home, extremely excited, feeling my mind was full of sentences I wanted to write.\n[1963-12-05 14:10:00] Street | I told Alfonso Carracci in great detail about my thoughts as I was on the way. I heard him expressing his concern for me, and he repeatedly told me not to write anything.\n[1963-12-05 14:10:10] Street | I heard, \"Will they write down your name?\"\n[1963-12-05 14:10:20] Street | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-12-05 14:10:30] Street | I heard, \"Rino, the priest will be angry, he'll make you fail the exam, he'll have the chemistry teacher and the math teacher join him on the same side.\"\n[1963-12-05 14:15:00] Street | I thought his anxiety had infected me, and I lost my confidence.\n[1963-12-05 14:20:00] Street | I thought that once we parted, once my small article quickly appeared in a magazine, printed with my name, I could show it to Lina, my parents, and Professor Oliviero and Professor Ferraro. Still, I decided to write the article. After finishing it, I would make amends.\n[1963-12-05 14:20:10] Street | I felt exhilarated at the thought of receiving applause from those people I admired, like Teacher Galiani and Nino.\n[1963-12-05 14:20:20] Street | I thought about joining forces with them to oppose the outdated people—Father, the chemistry teacher, and the math teacher—but in their eyes, I also needed to behave well in order to gain their appreciation and respect.",

    "text": "[1963-12-05 16:00:00] Outside the shoe repair shop | I saw the shop of Fernando. I thought of a victorious happiness, because I had also contributed to making it happen.\n[1963-12-05 16:00:10] Outside the shoe repair shop | I had never seen a sign on this shop before, but now there's a metal plate on the broken door, and it says: \"Lina.\"\n[1963-12-05 16:00:20] In front of the shoe repair shop | I saw Fernando, Rino, and the other three apprentices working from morning until night at the table, stitching edges, hammering, and polishing.\n[1963-12-05 16:00:30] Door of the shoe repair shop | I know everyone knows that Fernando thought those shoes, especially the women's ones, couldn't be made according to Lina's designs—they were just a girl's fanciful imagination.\n[1963-12-05 16:00:40] At the shoe repair shop door | I know everyone knows that Stefano went to the shop. He calmly said that the shoes he would make would be just like those on the drawings, and that's why he hung up the drawings.\n[1963-12-05 16:01:00] Outside the shoe repair shop | When I passed by the shop, I just glanced inside and quickly walked away. I thought of the blueprints hanging on the wall, which had deeply imprinted themselves in my mind.\n[1963-12-05 16:01:10] At the shoe repair shop door | I thought to myself: For Lina, those drawings were her fantasies, unrelated to money or selling herself. All the work being done was the final result of her delirium, a reflection of Stefano's love for her.\n[1963-12-05 16:01:20] At the shoe repair shop door | I thought she was lucky because she was deeply loved, she could be herself, and she had creativity.\n[1963-12-05 16:10:00] Posillipo | I saw that I had found some very concise and meaningful sentences, trying to clearly state my position, arguing with reason and dignity, and using many very obscure words.\n[1963-12-05 16:15:00] Posillipo | I saw myself writing: \"If God is everywhere, why does He still need the Holy Spirit to spread His presence?\"\n[1963-12-05 16:30:00] Posillipo | I saw that half a page was soon filled, and I had only finished the introduction. What should I do with the rest?\n[1963-12-05 17:00:00] Posillipo | I saw myself rewriting again, slowing down, starting from the most basic elements, hunching over and trying several times. The final result was basically satisfactory.\n[1963-12-05 17:30:00] Posillipo | I went to preview the next day's lessons.\n[1963-12-05 18:00:00] Posillipo | I thought about it, but less than half an hour later, I started having some doubts again. I felt I needed someone else's confirmation. Who could help me look at the article I wrote and give their opinion?\n[1963-12-05 18:00:10] Posillipo | I thought of my mother? My brothers? Antonio? They certainly couldn't do it. The only one was Lina.\n[1963-12-05 18:00:20] Posillipo | I thought about it, but going to see her would mean acknowledging her authority. In fact, I was the one who now had the knowledge.\n[1963-12-05 18:00:30] Posillipo | I thought about starting, and I was very reluctant to go find her. I was afraid she'd see the half page I'd written, and dismiss me with just a few short sentences.\n[1963-12-05 18:00:40] Posillipo | I realized that what I was really afraid of was that she would change my mind with just a few words, pushing my thoughts to extremes and breaking the balance I had carefully written on that half page.\n[1963-12-05 18:10:00] Lina's house | I ended up running to her, hoping to find her.\n[1963-12-05 18:15:00] Lina's House | I saw her at her parents' house, and I told her about Nino, handing her the notebook.\n[1963-12-05 18:15:10] Lina's House | I saw her looking at the page unwillingly, as if the words on it would hurt her eyes.\n[1963-12-05 18:15:20] Lina's house | I saw someone like Alfonso Carracci, and she asked me. I heard, \"They'll put your name on it?\"\n[1963-12-05 18:15:30] Lina's house | I saw myself nodding.\n[1963-12-05 18:15:40] Lina's house | I heard, \"Write Elena Greco?\"\n[1963-12-05 18:15:50] Lina's house | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:16:00] Lina's house | I saw her hand the notebook to me. I heard, \"I can't tell you whether it's good or bad.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:16:10] Lina's house | I heard, \"Please, I beg you.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:16:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"Don't do this, I don't have that ability.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:16:30] Lina's House | I saw that I had to insist again and again. I said to her—despite the fact that I knew full well it wasn't the truth. I heard myself say, \"If she doesn't like it, if she refuses to read the article, I won't have it printed by Nino.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:20:00] Lina's house | I watched until the end, she read the article, and she was completely absorbed, as if carrying a very heavy burden.\n[1963-12-05 18:20:10] Lina's house | I thought she was making a painful effort to free the old Lina deep inside herself—the Lina who read, wrote, painted, designed, and was quick-witted.\n[1963-12-05 18:25:00] Lina's house | I saw her finish reading the article, as if she had relaxed.\n[1963-12-05 18:25:10] Lina's house | I heard, \"May I edit it?\"\n[1963-12-05 18:25:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"Of course you can.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:26:00] Lina's house | I saw her delete many words, even entire sentences.\n[1963-12-05 18:26:10] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'May I move the sentence's position?'\"\n[1963-12-05 18:26:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:27:00] Lina's House | I saw her circle a sentence with a curve and move it to the top of the page.\n[1963-12-05 18:27:10] Lina's House | I heard, \"Can I copy the article onto another sheet of paper?\"\n[1963-12-05 18:27:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"I'll copy it myself.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:27:30] Lina's house | I heard, \"Let me do it.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:30:00] Lina's house | I watched her write for a while, and then she returned the notebook to me and said. I heard, \"You're really amazing, no wonder they all gave you a ten.\"\n[1963-12-05 18:30:10] Lina's house | I saw that in the end her tone became harsh, and she said. I heard, \"I never want to see anything you've written again.\" I thought I sensed no sarcasm in her tone; it was a sincere compliment.\n[1963-12-05 18:30:20] Lina's house | \"I heard 'Why?'\"\n[1963-12-05 18:30:30] Lina's house | I saw her thinking.\n[1963-12-05 18:30:40] Lina's house | I saw her tap her head with her finger and then laugh. I heard, \"Because it will give me a headache.\"\n[1963-12-05 19:00:00] Posillipo | I saw myself happily returning home, and in order not to disturb the others in the house, I locked myself in the bathroom and studied until 3 a.m. before going to sleep.\n[1963-12-05T10:00:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw, as usual, Lina completely unaware of the hostility around her, she threw herself into her new job.\n[1963-12-05T10:05:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw that soon, the store's sales shot up; she placed books among the shoes—books she had read. I saw people go to the shop not only to spend money but also to exchange a few words with that very beautiful, lively, and witty young woman.\n[1963-12-05T10:10:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw her lips move, saying some nice words, and she even handed me some chocolate. I know the people who come here are wives and daughters of lawyers or engineers, reporters from Il Messaggero, and playboys of all ages lingering in the club.\n[1963-12-05T10:15:00] Martiri Square Store | I thought that for them, it seemed Lina wasn't eager to sell them \"Lina\" or \"Sorola\" shoes; she just wanted them to sit on the sofa or armchair and chat for a while.\n[1963-12-06 06:30:00] Posillipo | I forced myself to get up at 6:30 in the morning and started copying the article.\n[1963-12-06 06:35:00] Posillipo | I looked at Lina's beautiful cursive writing, which had already taken shape in her elementary school days. I thought about her handwriting, which was very different from mine. My writing had become neater and smaller.\n[1963-12-06 06:40:00] Posillipo | I thought about the sentences on that page—they were really all mine, but clearer now—those parts that had been deleted, the changes in the order of the sentences, and the additions, all made my expression more effective.\n[1963-12-06 06:40:10] Posillipo | I thought of her handwriting, which gave me a feeling: as if I had escaped from myself, now running ahead by a hundred meters, full of energy, very harmonious, possessing the strength and coordination that the me following behind lacked.\n[1963-12-06 06:45:00] Posillipo | I thought about how I had decided to keep Lina's handwriting and stop copying it myself.",

    "text": "[1963-12-06 10:00:00] School | I saw myself handing the article to Nino. I thought that what I wanted was to preserve her handwriting in my language, a visible trace.\n[1963-12-06 10:05:00] School | I saw him blink several times as he read the article. Finally, he said with a hint of sadness. I heard, \"Professor Galiani is right.\"\n[1963-12-06 10:05:10] School | \"I heard 'What did she say?'\"\n[1963-12-06 10:05:20] School | I heard, \"You write better than I do.\"\n[1963-12-06 10:05:30] School | I felt very embarrassed and said it wasn't true, but he repeated the words again, then turned and left without even saying goodbye.\n[1963-12-06 10:05:40] School | I saw that he didn't even tell me when the magazine would come out or how to get it, and I didn't have the courage to ask him.\n[1963-12-06 10:05:50] School | When I saw him leave, I recognized in his distant figure the way his father walked. I felt a strong aversion to his attitude.\n[1963-12-10 10:00:00] School | I thought about how this meeting would end like this, how we were once again both wrong.\n[1963-12-10 10:00:10] School | I thought about how Nino had been avoiding me for several days, as if the fact that my article was better than his was a mistake, a crime. I felt really angry.\n[1963-12-10 16:00:00] Street | I saw that when we found time to meet, she talked about her life. I thought she was satisfied with her transformation, as if, aside from marriage, a house, and children, she could no longer see anything else, nor did she want to.\n[1963-12-10 16:00:10] Street | I thought I felt sad. She seemed to have become sweet, all her previous harshness was gone.\n[1963-12-10T10:00:00] Lina's house | I remember once when Rino came, he was very anxious and restless, and Lina received him.\n[1963-12-10T10:15:00] Lina's house | I saw how she reacted when her brother told her about the Solara brothers' actions, and it made him angry. I know that Lina's shoes are slowly being taken off the market, and now the shoe workshop is in trouble. Stefano is always preoccupied with his own affairs and no longer invests.\n[1963-12-10T10:30:00] Lina's house | I saw her say to him when he finally fell silent. I heard, \"Rino, you're the older brother, you're older than me. You have a wife and a son. Please! Live your own life, don't always come looking for me.\"\n[1963-12-10T10:45:00] Lina's house | I saw Rino was very sad after hearing that; he left dejectedly. I thought to myself before leaving: everyone is getting richer and richer, but not him. Because his sister doesn't care about her own family, nor about Lina's family; now she only thinks about the Carichis. He is now losing everything he has so hard-earned.\n[1963-12-10T11:00:00] Martiri Square Store | The only obstacle I saw was Michele. He often showed up at the store during work hours, clumsy and intrusive. He would speak in his sarcastic tone, saying things that had double meanings, and when he got to that point, he would lean in and kiss her. \"I heard, 'You've married the wrong man, Lina! My eyes are sharp: look, how good you are at dealing with people, that's useful for us. If we work together, in a few years, the entire San Gregorio Armeno will be ours, and we can do whatever we want.'\"\n[1963-12-10T11:05:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw Lina push him away, but he didn't get discouraged; he would still smile. I heard, \"Well, I'll wait.\" \"You can wait anywhere you like, but not here,\" she replied, \"if you keep waiting here, I'll leave for Capodimonte tomorrow.\"\n[1963-12-15 10:00:00] Street | I later heard a lot of rumors about her from Giggia Spagnuolo.\n[1963-12-15 10:00:10] Street | I saw Geyao La speaking in the local dialect, full of contempt, as she said to me. I heard, \"Now, your friend has become a princess. At that time, Marcello went to her house, and she played the flute for him every night. Did Stefano know about that?\"\n[1963-12-15 10:00:20] Street | I thought about how I pretended to ignore the meaning of \"blowing the flute,\" but in fact, I knew that word since I was very young. It sounded extremely unpleasant, carrying a sense of humiliation.\n[1963-12-15 10:00:30] Street | I heard, \"This isn't real.\"\n[1963-12-15 10:00:40] Street | I heard, \"Marcello said that.\"\n[1963-12-15 10:00:50] Street | I heard, \"He's lying.\"\n[1963-12-15 10:01:00] Street | \"I heard, 'Is that so? Then his brother is lying too?'\"\n[1963-12-15 10:01:10] Street | I heard, \"Is it Michele who told you?\"\n[1963-12-15 10:01:20] Street | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1963-12-15 10:01:30] Street | I thought to myself that I hoped those rumors would not reach Stefano's ears.\n[1963-12-15T13:00:00] Martiri Square Store | I noticed that Michele came less often, so Nino came more. I know that during the months he spent at Martiri Square, he finally had time to be with Lina every day for three hours, except on Sundays and holidays—and for them, that was almost unbearable.\n[1963-12-15T13:05:00] Martiri Square Store | At one o'clock, the clerk would lower the metal shutters three quarters of the way and then leave. Nino would go in through the small door of the restroom and leave at four o'clock before the clerk returned.\n[1963-12-15T13:10:00] Martiri Square Store | I remember only a few times when something unexpected happened. Twice, Michele and Giggia came, and once it got really tense—Stefano suddenly showed up. I knew that Nino had slipped into the toilet and then left through the small door leading to the courtyard.\n[1963-12-15T15:00:00] Lina's House | I saw even Michele lowering himself to come and see her. At first, he came twice a day, but only when he was sure Stefano wasn't home.\n[1963-12-15T15:10:00] Lina's house | I saw her, but she never opened the door. She sat silently in the kitchen, holding her breath.\n[1963-12-15T15:20:00] Lina's house | I saw that once, he could no longer stand the treatment, and before leaving, he shouted from the street. I heard, \"Do you think you're someone important? You whore! We had an agreement, and you didn't stick to it.\"\n[1963-12-18 13:00:00] At the school gate | I saw one day, after school, when his sister Pinocchia appeared. She seemed to have come to tell Nino something. I know it's been a long time since we met at Vomero.\n[1963-12-18 13:00:10] At the school gate | I saw her run downstairs immediately, being very friendly toward me. She said she was sorry I hadn't gone back to Balano in the summer.\n[1963-12-18 13:00:20] At the school gate | I saw myself walking with Alfonso Carracci back then, and I introduced him to her.\n[1963-12-18 13:05:00] Street | I saw that her brother had already left, but she insisted on walking with us for a while. She first told us about the pain of love she had suffered.\n[1963-12-18 13:10:00] Street | When I finished, she realized that I and Alfonso Carracci weren't a couple, so she stopped talking to me and instead, in her usual way, started speaking intimately with Alfonso Carracci.\n[1963-12-19 10:00:00] School | I saw that the next day, Nino started circling around me again, but just seeing him made me feel annoyed. I thought that after she got home, she would tell her brother that there was nothing between me and Alfonso Carracci.\n[1963-12-19 10:00:10] School | I thought, despite his hatred for his father, was he really as foolish as his father? Did he think everyone was dying to meet him, to love him? Was he so full of himself that he couldn't stand anyone being better than him?\n[1963-12-20 13:00:00] At the school gate | I saw that I had asked Antonio to pick me up at school, and he arrived immediately as I had requested. I thought that on one hand he was confused, and on the other hand, he was grateful that I had let him come.\n[1963-12-20 13:00:10] At the school gate | I saw myself grabbing his hand in front of everyone, our fingers entwined. I thought the thing that would surprise him the most was this.\n[1963-12-20 13:00:20] At the school gate | I thought about how I had always refused to walk with him, both inside and outside of Mergellina, because it made me feel like a child, walking with my father.\n[1963-12-20 13:00:30] At the school gate | I saw that, and that's exactly what I did. I knew Nino had seen us.\n[1963-12-20 13:00:40] At the school gate | I wanted him to know who I was: my writing was better than his, I would publish my own articles where he did, and I studied well at school, better than him.\n[1963-12-20 13:00:50] At the school gate | I thought of the man I had, this was my man, so I wouldn't follow him like a loyal little dog, trailing behind his back.\n[1963-12-20 16:00:00] Street | I thought, every time I came back from school, I wanted to say: Maybe, before something bad happens, I should tell Lina.\n[1963-12-20 16:00:10] Street | I thought about it, but I was afraid she'd get angry, because, given her upbringing, according to her personality, she would definitely go looking for Marcello with a knife.",

I heard her say, \"I know nothing at all.\" I replied to her.  \n\"Tell me the truth.\"  \n\"That's the truth.\"\n[1963-12-20T13:05:00] At the school gate | I know that later I found out, after that summer, he never showed up again, and neither she nor her daughter ever saw him again.\n[1963-12-20T13:10:00] At the school gate | I saw Galiani, as a mother, speaking with resentment.

He sent her a few lines from Vomero, which made her very upset.\"\n[1963-12-20T13:10:05] At the school gate | I saw that in the end she managed to control her emotions and spoke in her teacher's tone. I heard, \"Well, that's just how it is. You're all kids, and pain helps you grow.\"\n[1963-12-20T13:15:00] At the school gate | I saw myself nodding, then she asked me. I heard, \"Has he left you too?\"\n[1963-12-20T13:15:05] At the school gate | \"I heard 'me?'\"\n\"Didn't you see her at Vomero?\"\n\"Yes, but nothing happened between us.\" I saw my face turn red.\n[1963-12-20T13:20:00] At the school gate | I saw that I had strongly refuted the possibility, and I said I could meet Nadia face to face and tell her that nothing had ever happened between me and Nino, and never would. \"I heard 'Really?'\"\n\"Absolutely not.\"\n\"Nadia is certain that Nino left her because of you.\"\n[1963-12-20T13:25:00] At the school gate | I saw Teacher Galiani and she was happy, assuring me that she would tell Nadezhda. I didn't mention Lina, not only because I had already decided to do my own thing, but also because bringing her up would inevitably plunge me into pain.\n[1963-12-20T13:30:00] At the school gate | I tried not to bring up these things anymore, but Teacher Galiani mentioned Nino again. I knew there were several different versions about Nino; some said he hadn't taken the fall exams at all, and that he had already stopped going to school.\n[1963-12-20T13:35:00] At the school gate | I know someone who swore that one afternoon on Via Alemanni, she saw him alone, completely drunk, swaying as he walked and drinking from a bottle.\n[1963-12-20T13:40:00] At the school gate | I heard her conclude that perhaps it was because many people didn't like Nino, so someone was inclined to speak ill of him. But if that were really the case, it would be a great pity. \"I heard 'I think it's definitely not true,' I said.\"  \n\"Hope so. That boy, you just can't rely on him at all.\"\n[1963-12-20T13:45:00] At the school gate | I heard, \"Indeed.\"\n\"He's excellent.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"If you find out what he's up to, let me know.\"\n[1963-12-20T14:00:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I saw her and then we parted ways. I ran to give a Greek lesson to a high school girl living in Margaret Park, but I was received politely. I thought about it, but my thoughts were hard to calm down.\n[1963-12-20T14:10:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I saw that in the somewhat dim large room, there were many luxurious furnishings. The floor was covered with a carpet whose pattern depicted scenes of hunting, along with old photographs of high-ranking officers, and various symbols showcasing the authority and wealth of this family. I thought about all this and it made my fourteen-year-old student mentally and physically sluggish, and I found it unbearable as well.\n[1963-12-20T14:30:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I realized that, in the circumstances, I had to be very careful with my word choices and verb conjugations. I thought of how I kept recalling the image of Nino as described by Professor Galiani: wearing an old, worn-out coat, a crumpled tie, walking with long legs that stumbled awkwardly, holding an empty bottle, and then smashing it against a rock on the roadside after drinking from it.\n[1963-12-20T15:00:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I wondered what happened between him and Lina after Vomero? Perhaps everything was completely different from what I had expected. It was obvious that she regretted it, everything was over, and she had returned to her old life.\n[1963-12-20T15:10:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I thought about it, but Nino could never go back to the past. He had turned from a young scholar who could provide detailed answers to everything in the world into a decadent, abandoned man, because his love for the boss of Capodimonte had ended in failure.\n[1963-12-20T16:00:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I thought to myself that when I met Alfonso Carracci, I would ask him if there was any news about Nino. I wanted to go find Pinocchia and get information about her brother, but I forced myself to push him out of my mind.\n[1963-12-20T16:10:00] Margaret Park Student's Home | I thought this would pass. I thought, did he look for me? No. Did Lina look for me? No. Why should I worry about him, and about her? When have they ever worried about me? I'll just keep going to class and follow my own path.\n[1963-12-22 10:00:00] Street | I decided to tell her the gossip I'd heard, so she could prepare for whatever might happen, but I found out she already knew about it.\n[1963-12-22 10:00:10] Street | I thought not only that, but she knew much better what it meant to play the flute.\n[1963-12-22 10:00:20] Street | I realized, she said in a very clear way, that she would never do that for any man, she found it disgusting, let alone Marcello.\n[1963-12-22 10:00:30] Street | I saw her at the end and she told me that all those words had reached Stefano's ears.\n[1963-12-22 10:00:40] Street | I know he asked Lina about what their relationship was during the time Marcello went to her house.\n[1963-12-22 10:00:50] Street | I saw her answering very angrily. I heard, \"There's no relation at all! Are you crazy?\"\n[1963-12-22 10:01:00] Street | I saw Stefano immediately say that he believed Lina, that he had never doubted her, and that he had only asked the question to let her know that Marcello was spreading rumors about her.\n[1963-12-22 10:01:10] Street | I saw that, at this moment, he was wearing an expression full of interest. I thought, as if he had also been unable to help but imagine the scene of murder.\n[1963-12-22 10:01:20] Street | I saw Lina noticed it, and they discussed it for a long time.\n[1963-12-22 10:01:30] Street | I saw her say it to Stefano. I heard myself say, \"I feel a strong desire for revenge, but what's the point?\"\n[1963-12-22 10:01:40] Street | I saw them talk for a while and finally reach an agreement. According to the logic of Mergellina, they decided to give Solara a way to save face.\n[1963-12-22 10:01:50] Street | I looked at her in great surprise and asked. I heard, \"A step?\"\n[1963-12-22 10:02:00] Street | I heard, \"Yes, ignore them: Marcello, his brother, his father, his grandfather, everyone in their family, as if they didn't exist.\"\n[1963-12-22 10:02:10] Street | I know that's how it was—Stefano continued working without defending his fiancée's honor, and Lina continued living as Stefano's fiancée, without pulling out a knife or anything.\n[1963-12-22 10:02:20] Street | I know the Solara brothers continue to spread her rumors.\n[1963-12-22 10:03:00] Street | When I saw Lina leave, I felt extremely surprised. What had happened? I didn't understand.\n[1963-12-22 10:03:10] Street | I thought that the Solara brothers' intentions were clear, and their actions conformed to the ways of the world we had all known since childhood.\n[1963-12-22 10:03:20] Street | I wondered what was going on in her and Stefano's minds? Where exactly did they live?\n[1963-12-22 10:03:30] Street | I felt uneasy thinking about their actions, which I couldn't find even in the epics I read at school, let alone in the novels I had read.\n[1963-12-22 10:03:40] Street | I knew they never responded to any insults, including the unbearable things the Solara brothers did to them.\n[1963-12-22 10:03:50] Street | I thought about how they were always equally polite to everyone, how they were so courteous, like John Kennedy and Jackie visiting the slums.\n[1963-12-22 10:04:00] Street | When I saw them walking together, Stefano had one arm around Lina's shoulder. I thought that all the previous customs had nothing to do with them.\n[1963-12-22 10:04:10] Street | I saw them laughing, joking, hugging each other, [intimate gestures] falling on their lips.\n[1963-12-22 10:04:20] Street | I saw them speeding away in their convertible, even at night they were together alone. I saw her always dressed like a movie star.\n[1963-12-22 10:04:30] Street | I thought to myself: Who knows where they'll end up?\n[1963-12-22 10:04:40] Street | I know they go to places where no one is watching them. They aren't sneaking around; they have their parents' permission, and also Rino's.\n[1963-12-22 10:04:50] Street | I know they do as they please, paying no attention to what people say.\n[1963-12-22 10:05:00] Street | I wondered if it was Lina who had asked Stefano to do that? Making them the most envied and most talked-about couple in the entire Mergellina.\n[1963-12-22 10:05:10] Street | I thought this was the new trick she had come up with lately? She wanted to stay in this Mergellina, yet also leave it?\n[1963-12-22 10:05:20] Street | I thought she wanted to pull us out of our world, tear apart our old lives, and give us new lives, adapting to the way of life she created?",

    "text": "[1963-12-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I remember the time I was chatting with Pinocchio—probably around Christmas. She told me that since spring, when he came back from the army, up until Christmas, Enzo had been intimate with her only four times. I heard her add angrily, \"Maybe he's not a man.\"\n[1963-12-25T10:05:00] Mergellina | I remember how, when a man didn't really care about us, we girls would often say he wasn't a man. Enzo is a man, isn't he?\n[1963-12-25T10:10:00] Mergellina | I realized that I don't understand anything about the innermost thoughts of men, none of us do. When it comes to their incomprehensible behaviors, we all say this.\n[1963-12-25T10:15:00] Mergellina | I think of some men, like the Solara brothers, or Pasquale, Antonio, Donato Nino, or even my boyfriend Franco Mari from the Normal School, they all longed for us in different ways: domineering, servile, indifferent, attentive, but there's no doubt that they longed for us.\n[1963-12-25T10:20:00] Mergellina | I thought of other men, like Alfonso Carracci, Enzo, and Nino, whose feelings were completely different--there was always a certain distance between them and us, as if there were a wall between us, and crossing that wall was our own problem.\n[1963-12-25T10:25:00] Mergellina | I knew that after Enzo finished his military service, this trait became even more pronounced. I thought he would never do anything to please girls, and in fact, he never did anything to please anyone.\n[1963-12-25T10:30:00] Mergellina | I saw that his body was not tall to begin with, and combined with his self-restraint and suppression, he seemed even smaller, but dense and full of energy. His skin on his face looked like a tent spread out under the sun, motionless and expressionless. When he walked, only his legs moved; the rest of his body didn't shift at all—his arms didn't move, nor did his neck or head, not even his hair, which remained perfectly still, like a golden helmet.\n[1964-01-10 10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw myself making Antonio accompany me to Lina's wedding, forcing him to stay by my side, to talk to me, to dance with me.\n[1964-01-10 10:00:10] Posillipo | I thought about how I was terribly afraid of that day coming, feeling a complete tearing apart, and I wished someone would always support me.\n[1964-01-10 10:00:20] Posillipo | I thought such a request must have made him feel embarrassed.\n[1964-01-10 10:00:30] Mergellina | I saw Lina sending out invitations to everyone. All the mothers and grandmothers in the whole neighborhood were sewing new clothes, buying hats and small bags, and searching everywhere for wedding gifts.\n[1964-01-10 10:00:40] Mergellina | I knew they were all buying cups, plates, and cutlery.\n[1964-01-10 10:00:50] Mergellina | I thought about how much effort they were going through—not for Lina, but because of Stefano, a kind young man who allowed people to pay at the end of the month.\n[1964-01-10 10:01:00] Mergellina | I thought of something else: for everyone, a wedding is a place where one cannot afford to lose face, especially for girls who don't have a boyfriend. It's an opportunity for them to find a boyfriend at the wedding, settle down, and get married within a few years.\n[1964-01-10 10:01:10] Posillipo | I thought that because of all the reasons mentioned above, I wanted Antonio to stay with me forever.\n[1964-01-10 10:01:20] Posillipo | I thought about how I had no intention of officially announcing our relationship—both of us had been careful to keep it secret all along, but I wanted to be more charming, just to suppress my anxiety.\n[1964-01-10 10:01:30] Posillipo | I thought about how I wanted to behave properly and quietly in such a situation, wearing my glasses and the simple clothes my mother had sewn for me, along with my old shoes.\n[1964-01-10 10:01:40] Posillipo | I thought to myself: I have everything a sixteen-year-old girl should have; I don't need anything, anyone.\n[1964-01-10 10:01:50] Posillipo | I thought that Antonio's understanding wasn't like that; he loved me, and he believed I was the greatest happiness he had ever encountered.\n[1964-01-10 10:02:00] Posillipo | I saw him often loudly ask me, pretending to be funny, but his voice actually carried a hint of anxiety and tension. He asked me why I had chosen him, saying he was stupid and couldn't even speak clearly.\n[1964-01-10 10:02:10] Posillipo | I thought that, in reality, he was eager to go to my house and publicly announce our relationship to my parents, so my request made him think: I have decided to move us out of this secret relationship.\n[1964-01-10 10:02:20] Posillipo | I saw him borrow money to buy a set of clothes, let alone the fact that buying gifts also required money, and he had to buy clothes for Pinocchia and several younger brothers and sisters, as well as for Melina, who also needed to look presentable.\n[1964-01-10T10:00:00] Martiri Square Store | I thought to myself that for Lina, it was a rather unsettling time, yet also a very exciting one.\n[1964-01-10T10:05:00] Martiri Square Store | I saw that on one hand, she continued to play the role of a young wife, bringing a miraculous turnaround to the shoe store with her innovative ideas; on the other hand, she read to Nino, studied for him, and thought for him. I know that because some more important people also appear in the shoe store, she thinks they might be useful to Nino, so she tries to be friendly with them.\n[1964-01-10T10:10:00] Lina's House | I saw that she was no longer vomiting, but her face had turned pale. I saw her feel as if her body was expanding and swelling from the inside, and the changes within were even more obvious than those on the outside, as if every organ inside her body was getting fat.\n[1964-01-10T10:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her belly, which looked like a meaty ball, inflating with the child inside. I thought of this swelling that terrified her, the thing she had always feared most would happen: she would crack open and spread apart.\n[1964-01-10T10:20:00] Lina's House | I thought about it until, suddenly, she felt the child in her belly—the absurd existence of a life, that expanding lump of flesh—would finally come out from beneath her, like a doll with a string. She loved him, and through him, Lina would find herself.\n[1964-01-10T15:00:00] Tutoring Office | I stopped working at the bookstore after the holiday, and Teacher Galiani found me two tutoring jobs, which I both worked very hard at. I know I have classes and tutoring sessions; I don't have time for anything else.\n[1964-01-12 16:00:00] Main Road | I knew the rumors about Lina had reached Pasquale's ears, and suddenly everything was back to the old pattern.\n[1964-01-12 16:10:00] Main Road | I remember a Sunday when Camilla, Enzo, Pasquale, Antonio, and I were walking along the main road.\n[1964-01-12 16:10:10] Main Road | I heard Antonio say, \"I heard Marcello tell everyone that Lina was with him.\"\n[1964-01-12 16:10:20] Main Road | I saw Enzo blink once. I heard Pasquale immediately become very excited: \"What do you mean, 'together'?\"\n[1964-01-12 16:10:30] Main Road | I saw that Antonio was a bit embarrassed because of me and Carmela being there. I heard him say, \"You know.\"\n[1964-01-12 16:10:40] Main Road | I saw a few guys walk away, and they started talking among themselves.\n[1964-01-12 16:10:50] Main Road | I saw Pasquale growing more and more angry before my eyes. I saw Enzo's body becoming increasingly solid, as if he had no arms or neck, like a hard object.\n[1964-01-12 16:11:00] Main Road | I wondered why? I thought, why were they so angry? Lina wasn't their sister, not even their cousin.\n[1964-01-12 16:11:10] Main Road | I thought they were all outraged, three people full of anger, much more angry than Stefano, as if they were Lina's boyfriend instead.\n[1964-01-12 16:11:20] Main Road | I thought of Pasquale, which especially made me laugh, because he had just spoken ill of Lina.\n[1964-01-12 16:11:30] Main Road | I saw him later shouting loudly, and we all heard him clearly. That's what he said. I heard, \"I'm going to beat that bastard up, he made people think Lina's a whore. Stefano doesn't mind, but I do!\"\n[1964-01-12 16:12:00] Main Road | I saw them coming towards us, and we idly wandered around for a while together. I saw that in the end, there was only silence.\n[1964-01-12 16:12:10] Main Road | I saw myself walking with Antonio, while Carmela walked between her brother Pasquale and Enzo.",

    "text": "[1964-01-12 16:20:00] At the entrance of Posillipo | I saw that after a while, they sent us back home.\n[1964-01-12 16:20:10] At the entrance of Posillipo | I watched them walk away into the distance, Enzo the shortest, walking between Antonio and Pasquale.\n[1964-01-15 10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that in the coming days, everyone would be talking about the Solara brothers' \"Fiat 1100,\" the car that had been smashed into pieces.\n[1964-01-15 10:00:10] Mergellina | I know that wasn't all—both brothers were also beaten badly, but no one knew who did it.\n[1964-01-15 10:00:20] Mergellina | I know they all say it happened in a dark alley, and at least ten people were involved, all from out of town.\n[1964-01-15 10:00:30] Mergellina | I thought, but both I and Carmela clearly knew that only three people were involved, and we were very worried.\n[1964-01-15 10:00:40] Posillipo | I heard him asking me from time to time: \"Do you know how the shoes are coming along?\"\n[1964-01-15 10:00:50] Posillipo | I heard myself answer him: \"Ask Rino, Lina doesn't know anything.\"\n[1964-01-15 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought that was indeed the case.\n[1964-01-15T10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her start reading all the materials she could find, trying to figure out what was going on with her pregnancy, what was happening inside her belly, and how she should deal with childbirth. I thought about how she was worried that, because of not understanding, because of ignorance, she might make a mistake.\n[1964-01-15T15:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that after Christmas, I found out from Alfonso Carracci that Pinocchia had given birth to a boy named Fernando.\n[1964-01-18 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw us waiting for the Solara brothers to retaliate: one day, two days, three days. I thought about it, but clearly, they did it perfectly.\n[1964-01-18 10:00:10] Mergellina | I know that Pasquale continues to be a bricklayer, Antonio works as a laborer, and Enzo drives a horse-drawn cart selling fruits and vegetables.\n[1964-01-18 10:00:20] Mergellina | I knew that for a while, the Solara brothers could only walk, bruised and battered, always accompanied by three or four friends.\n[1964-01-18 10:00:30] Mergellina | I thought I had to admit that I was glad to see them as they are now, and I felt proud of my friends.\n[1964-01-18 10:00:40] Mergellina | I saw myself, Pinocchio, and Pinocchio together criticizing Stefano and Rino for pretending nothing had happened.\n[1964-01-20T10:00:00] Borgo | I know it was at that stage that Nino published an article about San Gregorio Armeno on Il Messaggero, which made him somewhat famous within the university circles. I thought to myself that at that time I had no idea about any of it. Thank goodness I didn't know, because I was already caught up in their affairs at Vomero. If I had gotten involved any further later on, I might never have been able to get out of that shadow for the rest of my life.\n[1964-01-20T10:05:00] Borgo | I saw, especially, when I read the article. I hadn't read more than a few sentences when I realized it was written by Lina. I thought the article didn't have much technique, and the amount of information wasn't great, but it carried a sharp intuition that could find connections between things that seemed, on the surface, very distant—especially the tone used in writing, which made me certain it was her.\n[1964-01-20T10:10:00] Borgo | I thought that Nino would never write like this, neither back then nor later; it was a style unique to Lina.\n[1964-01-20T16:00:00] Pinocchio's house | I saw myself going to see her, but when I saw her, she had already gotten up, wearing a nightgown and slippers, and her face looked unwell. I thought of her lying in bed, happily breastfeeding the child.\n[1964-01-20T16:05:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw her mother say, \"Lie down in bed, don't tire yourself out.\" But she didn't hesitate to tell her to stop talking. I heard her say, full of sorrow, as she brought me to the cradle: \"I can't do anything right. Look how ugly he is. I can't even stand to touch him, I can't even look at him.\"\n[1964-01-20T16:10:00] Pinochia's House | I saw that even though Maria was standing at the door, she whispered a comforting word to her: \"What are you talking about, Pinocchio, he's very handsome.\" I heard her, but she continued to speak angrily: \"He's ugly, even uglier than Rino, everyone in his family is ugly.\"\n[1964-01-20T16:15:00] Pinochia's House | I saw her give a quick sob, her eyes full of tears, and she cried out in despair. \"I heard, 'It's all my fault, I chose the wrong husband! When you were a girl, you didn't think so much. Now look, what son did I have? His flat nose is just like Lina...\"\n[1964-01-20T16:20:00] Pinocchio's House | I started cursing her sister-in-law in a disjointed way. I knew from her that Lina, that \"slut,\" had already been working at the shop on Martiri Square for fifteen days, doing whatever she wanted.\n[1964-01-20T16:25:00] Pinocchio's House | I knew Girolama had to give in and return to the Solara brothers' pastry shop, and Pinochia herself had to give in too, because now she had a child and didn't know when she'd be able to escape.\n[1964-01-20T16:30:00] Pinochia's House | I know, as usual, everyone has to make concessions. First Stefano, and now Lina comes up with a new trick every day: when she goes to work, she dresses as if she's going to a TV show, just like a guest on Mike Bongiorno. If her husband doesn't drive her, she lets Michele take her, completely indifferent to what people might think.\n[1964-01-20T16:35:00] Pinocchio's House | I know she didn't care how much money she spent on the two paintings, which were completely unrecognizable; she hung them in the shop, but it was unclear why. She bought a lot of books and placed them on a shelf. Instead of shoes, the shelf held those books.\n[1964-01-20T16:40:00] Pinocchio's House | I know she got some sofas, turning the store into a salon, with single sofas, lady's chairs, and a crystal bowl filled with Gendai chocolates that anyone could take for free.\n[1964-01-20T16:45:00] Pinocchio's House | I thought, as if she wasn't there in the shop to smell customers' stinky feet, but rather to be a noblewoman in a castle.\n[1964-01-20T16:50:00] Pinochia's House | I heard her say, \"Not only that.\" She added, \"There's something even worse.\"  \n\"What is it?\"  \n\"Do you know what Marcello did?\"\n[1964-01-20T16:50:05] Pinocchio's house | \"I heard, 'I don't know.'\"\n\"Do you remember the shoes Stefano and Rino gave him?\"\n\"The ones Lina designed herself and made with her own hands?\"\n[1964-01-20T16:50:10] Pinochia's House | \"I heard 'it's those broken shoes, Rino said the shoes would get waterlogged as soon as it rained.'\"\n\"Remember, what happened?\"\n[1964-01-20T17:00:00] Pinocchio's house | I saw Pinocchio tell me something that unsettled me. I know the situation is very confusing, involving money, conspiracies, debts, and all sorts of underhanded dealings.\n[1964-01-20T17:05:00] Pinocchio's House | I know Marcello was very dissatisfied with the new shoes Rino and Fernando made, of course he had already made an agreement with Michele. He had someone else manufacture the shoes Lina had designed, but not at the \"Lina\" factory, instead at a factory in Afragola.\n[1964-01-20T17:10:00] Pinochia's House | I know that around Christmas time, they put up \"Soraya\" labels in the stores everywhere, especially in the shops on Martirini Square.\n[1964-01-20T17:15:00] Pinocchio's house | \"I heard 'Could they really do that?'\"\n\"Of course they could. The shoes were his. My brother and my husband, those two bastards, gave him the shoes, and he could do whatever he wanted.\"\n\"What happened after that?\"\n[1964-01-20T17:20:00] Pinocchio's house | \"I heard her say, 'So now there are 'Lina' shoes and 'Soraya' shoes at San Gregorio Armeno. The 'Soraya' shoes are selling very well now, better than the 'Lina' ones.'\"\n[1964-01-20T17:25:00] Pinocchio's house | I heard that Solara made a lot of money, and now Rino is really upset because he thought he could accept competition from anyone except Solara—his partner—and plus, those shoes were made by his own hands, but they were rejected, which was totally stupid at the time.\n[1964-01-20T17:30:00] Pinocchio's House | I thought of Marcello. That time, Lina held a knife for cutting leather and threatened him. He was a beat slower than Michele, more shy. What was the point of him doing such an unreasonable thing?\n[1964-01-20T17:35:00] Pinocchio's House | I knew the Solara family had already gotten involved in enough shady dealings, some open and some not. Their power was growing day by day. Since their grandfather's time, they'd already been on good terms with the city's powerful figures. They supported others, and in return, they received support.\n[1964-01-20T17:40:00] Pinocchio's house | I know their mother lends money at high interest rates. She has a red ledger that makes half of Mergellina afraid. Lina's family and the Carracci family might have borrowed money from them as well.\n[1964-01-20T17:45:00] Pinochia's House | I thought that for Marcello, and for him and Michele, the shoe store on Martiri Square was nothing more than one of many \"sources\" they used to make money at home. Of course, it wasn't the most important one. Did he really need to do this?\n[1964-01-20T17:50:00] Pinocchio's House | I was annoyed by the story of Pinocchio: beyond money, I sensed something unbearable. Marcello's love for Lina had ended, but the wound was still there, and it had already become infected.\n[1964-01-20T17:55:00] Pinochia's House | I heard \"Rino,\" Pinocchio said to me, \"he went on a protest with Stefano, but nothing came of it.\" I thought he no longer depended on her, and he felt the urge to take revenge on those who had humiliated him before.\n[1964-01-20T18:00:00] Pinocchio's house | I thought about how the Solara brothers must have treated them. Used to getting their way, the entire process was all about them talking.\n[1964-01-20T18:05:00] Pinochia's House | I know that in the end, Marcello said he and his brother would make a series of \"Soraya\" shoes, making some improvements based on the previous pair they had launched.\n[1964-01-20T18:10:00] Pinochia's House | I heard him say at the end, \"Let's see how the market reacts to your new shoes, and then we'll decide whether to keep them on the market. Do you understand?\"\n[1964-01-20T18:15:00] Pinocchio's house | I realized, Marcello wanted to erase the \"Lina\" brand from the market and replace it with the \"Solaara\" brand, which would cause Stefano a great financial loss.\n[1964-01-20T18:20:00] Pinochia's House | I heard, \"What was Lina's reaction?\" I thought to myself, I should leave this Mergellina, leave San Gregorio Armeno, what did these disputes between them have to do with me? But at that moment, I asked.",

    "text": "[1964-01-20T18:20:05] Pinocchio's House | I heard, \"The problem is right there in her.\" I saw a fierce light in Pinocchio's eyes.\n[1964-01-20T18:25:00] Pinochia's House | I saw Lina brush the matter aside with a smile, but Rino and her husband were very angry, she said. I know it was you who gave it to him, not me; it was you who wanted to get involved with the Solara brothers, not me; you two damn fools, what could I do?\n[1964-01-20T18:30:00] Pinocchio's House | I knew Michele had once again insisted that she go to the shop on Martiri Square, and it was true—she suddenly agreed, and she kept pestering Stefano until he gave in. I thought she was really annoying, never knowing which side she was on—whether with the family or with the Solara brothers.\n[1964-01-20T18:35:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw Pinocchio let out a long sigh, her face full of annoyance. I asked. I heard, \"Why did Stefano agree?\"\n[1964-01-20T18:40:00] Pinocchio's House | I heard her say that Stefano agreed because he knew Michele had always cared about Lina, and Marcello had always liked her, and she might still turn things around.\n[1964-01-20T18:45:00] Pinocchio's house | I know, but Rino doesn't trust his sister. He's very afraid and can't sleep at night. The shoes he and Fernando abandoned were taken advantage of by Marcello, and everyone loves them, so they sell very well.\n[1964-01-20T18:50:00] Pinocchio's house | What would happen if the Solara brothers had dealt directly with Lina, if she, as before, had been so annoying and refused to design new shoes for her family, instead choosing to design shoes for the Solaras?\n[1964-01-20T18:55:00] Pinocchio's House | I said to Pinocchio. I heard, \"It won't happen again.\"  \n\"Did she tell you?\"  \n\"No, I haven't seen her since summer.\"\n[1964-01-20T19:00:00] Pinocchio's House | \"I heard 'Then why do you say that?'\"\n\"I know her. When Lina becomes curious about something, she'll work very hard to research it. But once she's done, she loses all interest and never pays attention to it again.\"\n[1964-01-20T19:05:00] Pinocchio's house | I saw Maria's words made me happy, so I quickly used my own words to reassure my daughter. I heard, \"You're sure it's like that?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Did you hear?\" she said, \"There's no problem, Elena knows what she's talking about.\"\n[1964-01-20T19:10:00] Pinocchio's house | I thought about it, but in reality I knew nothing. On one hand, I was showing off my eloquence, but on the other hand, I deeply understood Lina's uncertainty.\n[1964-01-20T19:15:00] Pinocchio's house | I thought about how eager I was to leave that room. I thought, what do these filthy matters—Marcello's revenge, everyone's worries and pursuit of money, cars, houses, furniture, and vacations—have to do with me?\n[1964-01-20T19:20:00] Pinocchio's House | I thought about Lina returning from Vomero after Nino, and how she could possibly deal with those gangsters. I thought I would get my high school diploma, I would go to interviews, find a job, and escape this disgusting reality—I would fly away far, far away.\n[1964-01-20T19:25:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw, but when I saw the child Maria was holding, my heart softened, and I said. I heard, \"He's really handsome.\"\n[1964-01-20T19:25:10] Outside Pinocchio's house | I saw it to the end, but I still couldn't hold back. I kept backing away, and in the end, I gave in. I felt an irresistible impulse, and although I kept trying to retreat in my heart, I ultimately gave in.\n[1964-01-20T19:25:20] Outside Pinocchio's house | I saw myself asking Alfonso Carracci if he was free on Sunday and inviting him to go for a walk with Pinocchia.\n[1964-01-25T10:00:00] Lina's House | I saw once when Pinocchio came to her, asking for money. She said she had no money and told Pinocchio to go find Stefano. Pinocchio left, feeling discouraged.\n[1964-01-25T10:05:00] Lina's house | I thought that, besides the child in her belly, she didn't care about anything or anyone else.\n[1964-01-25T11:00:00] Mergellina | I thought about how this had hurt Pinocchio, and she had become even more hostile than before.\n[1964-01-25T11:10:00] Mergellina | I know that what she could not forgive Lina for first was breaking their alliance in the new Capodimonte, and secondly, that she could not forgive Lina for no longer giving her money. I thought about her, but what she could not forgive especially was Lina's behavior.\n[1964-01-25T11:20:00] Mergellina | I know, just as it's been said outside, that Lina left, disappeared, and then came back again. She can still play the role of a wealthy lady, has a beautiful house, and is about to have a child soon. I thought, she was so angry, the more shameless one became, the more they gained, while she worked from morning till night, yet nothing made her happy—only bad things kept happening one after another.\n[1964-01-25T11:30:00] Mergellina | I know that first my father died in prison, and then my mother ended her life in that decisive way, she didn't even want to mention the matter anymore.\n[1964-01-27T19:00:00] Elena's Pizza Place | I saw Alfonso Carracci happy, and we went together to a pizzeria on Via Favia. I thought about how I had noticed Alfonso Carracci was happy to accept my invitation.\n[1964-01-27T19:15:00] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I asked about Lydia and her other children, especially Ciro, and then I asked what Nino was up to.\n[1964-01-27T19:15:10] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I saw Pinocchia reluctantly answering me. I thought about how, whenever I mentioned Nino, Pinocchia became very annoyed.\n[1964-01-27T19:15:20] Elena's Pizza Shop | I heard that Nino had been having mental health issues for a while, and in the end, he even fought with his father. My most beloved father thought he was beyond saving.\n[1964-01-27T19:15:30] Elena's Pizza Shop | I heard her say, \"I don't know why he became so unreasonable: he didn't want to continue studying anymore, he wanted to leave Italy, but then suddenly his madness passed: he went back to his old self and started taking exams again.\"\n[1964-01-27T19:15:40] Elena's Pizza Place | I saw what I asked. \"I heard 'Is he okay now?'\"\n[1964-01-27T19:15:45] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I saw Pinocchio answer. I heard, \"That's it.\"\n[1964-01-27T19:15:50] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I saw my question. I heard, \"Is he happy?\"\n[1964-01-27T19:15:55] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I saw Pinocchio say. I heard, \"For him, it was probably happy.\"\n[1964-01-27T19:16:00] Elena's Pizza Shop | I saw myself continuing to ask. I heard, \"Does he only study?\"\n[1964-01-27T19:16:05] Elena's Pizza Place | I saw Pinocchio ask back. I heard, \"Are you wondering if he has a girlfriend?\"\n[1964-01-27T19:16:10] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I saw and denied. \"I heard 'It's not that, I just mean whether he goes out to play, whether he goes dancing or not.'\"\n[1964-01-27T19:16:15] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I saw Pinocchio answer. \"I don't know, Elena. He's always out there, now he's obsessed with movies, novels, and art. He rarely comes home, and when he does, he immediately argues with dad, just to provoke him and fight.\"\n[1964-01-27T19:16:30] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I felt relieved to learn that Nino had recovered, but at the same time, I had a bitter feeling.\n[1964-01-27T19:16:40] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I thought to myself: Is he now into movies, novels, and art? People change so quickly; how fast their interests and emotions can shift.\n[1964-01-27T19:16:50] Elena's Pizza Place | I know that for him, literature used to be just the accumulation of words, a series of sentences that appeared smooth on the surface, placed one after another. The more sentences someone had, the more they could pile up. I thought about how I felt foolish, ignoring the things I liked in order to adapt to what Nino liked.\n[1964-01-27T19:17:00] Pizza Place on Fria Street | Yes, yes, I should accept reality, everyone should walk their own path.\n[1964-01-27T19:17:10] Pizza Place on Fria Street | I hoped that Pinocchia hadn't told Nino about our meeting, and I'd inquired about him; I also hoped that Alfonso Carracci wouldn't mention our meeting to Lina.\n[1964-01-27T19:17:20] Elena's Pizza Place | I thought to myself, after this night, I would never mention Nino and Lina again.",

She puts it in her pocket without saying a word, but in the morning she gets up very early to prepare breakfast for me, and sometimes even carefully makes egg pudding for me.\n[1964-02-01 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that after some time, Marcello and Michele bought a green \"Julietta,\" and they once again acted as if they were the owners of this Mergellina, showing off aggressively, even more so than before.\n[1964-02-01 10:00:10] Mergellina | I thought this might confirm Lina's words: to defeat such people, you had to live a better life, one they couldn't even imagine.\n[1964-02-01T07:00:00] My home | I saw that I was still in bed. I heard her tapping the bowl with a spoon, and I saw that her egg pudding was truly melt-in-your-mouth tender.\n[1964-02-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that later, Lina found out she was pregnant, and she decided to put an end to this makeshift arrangement at Martiri Square.\n[1964-02-01T12:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her run to her brother and Pasquale, crying and telling them about it. They went to find Enzo and asked him to explain, but Enzo didn't explain anything either, and now they don't speak anymore.\n[1964-02-10T10:00:00] Small Garden | When I returned from Borgo to San Gregorio Armeno during the carnival holiday, I met Pinocchia in the small garden, and she complained to me.\n[1964-02-10T10:05:00] Small Garden | I saw her crying and saying. I heard, \"I was so foolish. While he was in the army, I was waiting for him all along. I was too silly, working hard all day long just for a few coins.\"\n[1964-02-10T10:10:00] Small Garden | I saw that she found all of this very annoying, and without any transition, she suddenly started cursing Lina; in the end, she even said that Lina was having an affair with Michele, because someone had seen him hanging around the house in Karrachi. \"I heard her say, 'Wearing a green hat, lots of money,' \" she said angrily, \"she lives off that.\"\n[1964-02-10T10:15:00] Small Garden | I saw nothing about Nino; she didn't say a single word about him. It was nothing short of a miracle that Mergellina didn't know about her and Nino.\n[1964-02-11T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw Antonio telling me over those days that he had beaten Nino and that he had sent Enzo to pick up Lina, but he only told me. I thought to myself that I was certain, he had never told anyone else about this matter except for me.\n[1964-02-12T10:00:00] Mergellina | I learned the rest of the story from Alfonso Carracci; under my constant questioning, he told me that according to Pinochietta, Nino had started attending Porto.\n[1964-02-15T09:00:00] Home | I saw myself throwing myself into my studies, desperately increasing my study time so that I was busy day and night.\n[1964-02-15T09:00:10] Home | I know that year, I studied so hard I almost drove myself crazy, but at the same time I also took on some tutoring jobs and earned a lot of money. I thought about the iron discipline I had set for myself: I would be even stricter than the way I studied as a child.\n[1964-02-15T09:00:20] Home | I know that every day's time is arranged, from getting up at dawn until late at night, like a straight line.\n[1964-02-15T09:00:30] Home | I know that in the past, because of Lina, I sometimes strayed off track, experiencing surprises and new discoveries. I thought to myself, now I must tap into all of my potential.\n[1964-02-15T09:00:40] Home | I thought to myself that I was already nineteen, I couldn't rely on anyone anymore, and I would never need anyone again!\n[1964-02-15T10:00:00] School | I know that the school teachers all agreed that I was the best student in the school, because the whole school was also lifeless, and I effortlessly maintained the top position in my class. After Nino graduated, I became one of the best students in the entire school.\n[1964-02-15T11:00:00] Beside the Big Road | I saw her, Lina, by the roadside on Saturday when I happened to meet her during mass. The thought that gave me a little pleasure was this: I knew more about her life than she did herself; from the facts I knew, it was easy to guess that after she took Nino away from me, she hadn't gained anything at all.\n[1964-02-15T11:05:00] Beside the Big Road | I saw that her stomach was already clearly swollen, like a tumor on her thin body; her face wasn't glowing like other pregnant women, but was pale, with the skin on her cheekbones tight and shiny. She had become ugly.\n[1964-02-15T11:06:00] Beside the Big Road | I saw that both of us were pretending nothing had happened. I heard, \"Are you okay?\" \"Fine.\" \"Can I touch your stomach?\" \"Go ahead.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:07:00] Beside the Big Road | I heard, \"What about that thing?\" \"Which one?\" \"The Vomero thing.\" \"It's over.\" \"That's a shame.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:08:00] Beside the Big Road | I heard, \"What are you doing?\" \"Going to school. Now I have my own room, all the books I need, and someone like a boyfriend.\" \"Like a boyfriend?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:09:00] Beside the Big Road | I heard, \"What's his name?\" \"Franco Mari.\" \"What does he do?\" \"He's also studying.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:10:00] Beside the Big Road | I heard, \"Your glasses are really nice.\" \"They were bought by Franco Mari.\" \"What about this dress?\" \"He bought that too.\" \"He's rich?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:11:00] Beside the Big Road | \"I'm happy for you. How are you studying?\" \"I'm studying hard. If I don't do well, I'll be expelled.\" \"You should be more careful.\" \"I am being careful.\" \"You're lucky.\" \"Hmm.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:12:00] Beside the Big Road | I saw her say she would give birth in July, and a doctor was regularly checking her up, the one who had suggested she go to the seaside, a doctor, not a midwife from Mergellina. \"I'm scared of children,\" she said, \"I don't want to have [a birth state] at home.\" I read somewhere that it's best to give birth in a hospital.\n[1964-02-15T11:13:00] Beside the Big Road | I saw her smiling, she touched her stomach and said something vague. I heard, \"I'm still here, just for this.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:14:00] Beside the Big Road | I heard, \"Don't you feel happy about being pregnant?\" \"No, I find it annoying, but I'm willing to do it.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:15:00] By the Big Road | I heard, \"Is Stefano angry?\" \"He wants to believe what's in his favor.\" \"Which means?\" \"Which means, for a while I had [mental health issues], and I went to Borgo to find you.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:16:00] By the Big Road | I pretended not to know anything, and said in surprise. I heard, \"In Borgo? Me and you?\" \"Yes.\" \"If he asks me, I'll say that?\" \"You can say whatever you want.\"\n[1964-02-15T11:17:00] Beside the Big Road | I saw that we said goodbye, saying we would write to each other, but we never did, and I never found out about her [childbearing status]. I sometimes have a wicked thought: I hope something unfortunate happens so that the child will never be born, but I immediately dismiss such thoughts.\n[1964-02-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I sometimes run into Pinocchia, and she's always pushing Fernando's cart. I saw that she had completely broken down.\n[1964-02-20T10:05:00] Mergellina | I would stop and chat with her for a while, listening idly to her complaints. I heard her complain about Rino, Stefano, Lina, and Giggia, complaining about everything.\n[1964-02-20T11:00:00] School | When I returned the book she had lent me, she seemed very unhappy because it was full of sand. She took the books away without saying that she would lend me others again. I thought to myself that I would soon find out, although Teacher Galiani had always been generous with me, I didn't know where I had offended her, and she was no longer as polite to me as before.",

I heard her counting the days, waiting for Enzo to come back from the military. She said her brother Pasquale was working on a construction site and also had to attend Communist Party's event.\n[1964-02-28T10:00:00] Mergellina | I sometimes run into Pinocchia, and as soon as she sees me, she starts talking about Lina behind her back.\n[1964-02-28T10:05:00] Mergellina | When I saw her speak of Stefano, her face was full of tenderness. I know, but she's satisfied with Stefano. I realized it wasn't just because Stefano gave her a raise, but also because he was hardworking, diligent, and kind to people.\n[1964-02-28T10:06:00] Mergellina | I heard Pinocchia always took Stefano's side, saying it was a terrible thing for him to have married such an icy, cruel wife.\n[1964-02-28T10:07:00] Mergellina | I heard her tell me that Antonio had been discharged early because he had [mental health issues].\n[1964-02-28T10:07:10] Mergellina | I saw what I asked. \"I heard 'Why?'\"\n[1964-02-28T10:07:20] Mergellina | I saw Pinocchio answer. I heard, \"You know what he's like, you once made him break down.\"\n[1964-02-28T10:07:30] The Old Library | I was hurt by these words, but I tried not to think about them.\n[1964-03-01T10:00:00] The Old Library | I saw a winter Sunday, and I happened to meet Antonio. I saw him and barely recognized him, he had become extremely thin.\n[1964-03-01T10:00:10] Mergellina | I saw myself smiling at him, waiting for him to stop and talk to me, but he seemed not to see me and kept walking forward.\n[1964-03-01T10:00:20] Mergellina | I called his name, and he turned around. I saw a bewildered smile on his face.\n[1964-03-01T10:00:30] Mergellina | I saw him say it. I heard, \"Hello, Elena.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:00:35] The Old Library | I saw what I said. I heard, \"Hello, it's nice to meet you.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:00:40] Mergellina | I saw him say it. I heard, \"I'm also very happy.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:00:45] Mergellina | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"What are you doing?\"\n[1964-03-01T10:00:50] Mergellina | I saw him answer. I heard \"Nothing much.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:00:55] Mergellina | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"Aren't you going back to the repair shop?\"\n[1964-03-01T10:01:00] Mergellina | I saw him say it. I heard, \"There are no more seats left.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:01:05] Mergellina | I saw and encouraged her. I heard, \"You're capable, you can find a job elsewhere.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:01:10] Mergellina | I saw him say it. I heard, \"No, if my illness isn't cured, I won't be able to work.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:01:15] Mergellina | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"What's wrong with you?\"\n[1964-03-01T10:01:20] Mergellina | I saw him answer. I heard \"afraid.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:01:30] Mergellina | I heard him say it was really fear.\n[1964-03-01T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know that in Corvino, one night while on guard duty, he remembered a game his father used to play with him when he was very young: his father would draw eyes and mouths on the five fingers of his left hand with a pen, then move those fingers so they could talk to each other, as if they were five little people.\n[1964-03-01T10:05:10] Mergellina | I knew it was a very fun game. I couldn't help but feel my eyes well up when I thought about how he had remembered this.\n[1964-03-01T10:05:20] Mergellina | I know, but that night, while he was on duty, he felt his father's hand entering his own. He felt each of his fingers turn into little people, very small, very small, but all complete. These little people were laughing and singing.\n[1964-03-01T10:05:30] Mergellina | I knew he was scared. He wildly beat the booth with his hands, drawing blood from them, but he still felt those fingers singing and laughing, never stopping for a moment.\n[1964-03-01T10:05:40] Mergellina | I know that after he finished his shift, he felt a bit better when he went to sleep. He rested and by the next morning, there was nothing wrong with him anymore. But in his heart, he was still frightened, worried that the illness in his hand might come back.\n[1964-03-01T10:05:50] Mergellina | I knew his illness had actually relapsed, becoming more frequent over time. His fingers would sing and laugh during the day. Later, the soldiers thought he was crazy and sent him to a doctor.\n[1964-03-01T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw him say it. I heard, \"Now I'm better, but there's still a chance it could come back.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:10:10] Mergellina | I saw what I said. I heard, \"Tell me how I can help you.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:10:20] Mergellina | I saw him hesitate, as if truly considering some possibilities, and finally he said in a low voice. I heard, \"No one can help me.\"\n[1964-03-01T10:10:30] Mergellina | I realized then that I had already completely disappeared from Antonio's mind, and he no longer felt anything for me.\n[1964-03-01T11:00:00] School | I noticed that she never gave me the newspapers she had read anymore. I saved up and bought Il Messaggero a few times, but then I stopped because I got tired of it—it was just wasting money. She never invited me to her house again, even though I really wanted to see her son Nadia again. I know, but she still publicly praised me, gave me a very high score, and recommended me to attend some seminars, even to watch some meaningful movies that were openly shown in Albenga by a few priests.\n[1964-03-08T10:00:00] Downstairs from Antonio's house | After that meeting, I developed the habit of going to his window every Sunday and calling out to him. I know we were walking in the courtyard, chatting here and there, until he said he was tired, and then we went home separately.\n[1964-03-08T10:05:00] Downstairs from Antonio's house | Sometimes I saw Melina come down, and the three of us, me, Antonio, and his mother, would take a walk together. I saw Melina with heavy makeup on.\n[1964-03-08T10:10:00] Mergellina | I sometimes see Pinocchia come down, and we go a bit farther. I know, but usually it was just the three of us talking, and Antonio stayed silent, and later this became a habit.\n[1964-03-15T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that I had gone to the funeral of Nicola Sicanò with Antonio. I knew Nicola was the vegetable seller from our Mergellina, Enzo's father, who died suddenly from pneumonia. When Enzo came back on leave, Nicola was already dead.\n[1964-03-20T10:00:00] At Pasquale's house | I saw myself and Antonio going together to comfort Pasquale, Pinocchia, and their mother Giuseppina. I know because we found out that Pasquale's father, the carpenter who killed Don Achille, died in prison of a heart attack.\n[1964-03-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that when we found out that Carlo Resta, the man who sold soap and household goods, had been beaten to death in his basement, we were together.\n[1964-03-25T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw that we had talked for a long time. I heard everyone in Mergellina talking about it. Some of the rumors were true, others were cruel imaginings. I know some people say he wasn't dead enough—they even shoved a blade up his nose; others say it was a roaming criminal who came here, the one who robbed the day's earnings and killed him.\n[1964-03-25T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw it, but later Pasquale told us that he had heard another version, which he thought was more likely. I heard, \"Carlo owes Sora money because he's a gambler; he borrowed money from Sora's mother to pay off his gambling debts.\"\n[1964-03-25T10:10:10] Mergellina | \"I heard 'And then?' Pinocchio asked.\" I always had some doubts about her bold speculation regarding her boyfriend.\n[1964-03-25T10:10:20] Mergellina | I heard, \"He was killed because he didn't want to pay back the usurers.\"\n[1964-03-25T10:10:30] Mergellina | I heard, \"Come on, you just like to make things up.\"\n[1964-03-25T10:15:00] Mergellina | I know it's possible that Pasquale was exaggerating, but first, we don't know who killed Carlo Este, and second, after the incident, although the shop was still run by Carlo's wife and eldest son, Solara bought the underground store and all its contents for very little money.\n[1964-03-25T10:15:10] Mergellina | \"I heard 'Because they are generous.' Pinocchio said.\n[1964-03-25T10:15:20] Mergellina | I heard Pasquale say, \"Because they're all villains.\"\n[1964-03-25T10:20:00] Mergellina | I was thinking about this matter, and I don't remember if Antonio had made any comments at the time.\n[1964-03-25T10:20:10] Mergellina | I thought about the illness that plagued him, and in a way, Pasquale's words had made his condition worse. He felt that his physical imbalance had spread throughout the entire Mergellina, manifesting through those evil events.\n[1964-04-01T00:00:00] My Dream | I saw that during that time, I often dreamed about Lina. I remember once I dreamed of her lying in bed, wearing a green nightgown covered in lace, her hair in two braids—a thing that never happened in reality—and she was holding a baby girl dressed in pink.\n[1964-04-01T00:05:00] My Dream | I heard her keep saying in a sorrowful voice, \"Take a photo of me, don't include the child.\"\n[1964-04-10T00:00:00] My Dream | I saw it once again, I dreamed that she welcomed me happily, called her daughter over to meet me, and her daughter had the same name as me. I heard her say, \"Elena, come over and say hello to Auntie.\"\n[1964-04-10T00:05:00] My Dream | I saw a very fat woman appear at that moment, much older than us. Lina told me to undress the woman, bathe her, change her diaper, and dress her again.\n[1964-04-12T11:00:00] Courtyard | I know that the worst thing for us happened on a warm Sunday in the spring of that year.\n[1964-04-12T11:05:00] Courtyard | I remember that day, me, Antonio, Pasquale, and Pinocchia were waiting in the courtyard for Pinocchia, who had gone upstairs to get her sweater.\n[1964-04-12T11:10:00] Courtyard | I had been watching for five minutes when Pinocchio stuck her head out the window and called to her brother. I heard, \"Pasquale, I can't find Mama. The bathroom is locked from the inside, and when I called her, she didn't answer.\"",

    "text": "[1964-04-12T11:10:10] Staircase of Pasquale's house | I saw Pasquale rush upstairs immediately, taking the steps two at a time, and we followed behind him.\n[1964-04-12T11:10:20] Pasquale's house | I saw him run upstairs, and we saw Pinocchia anxiously standing at the bathroom door. Pasquale was awkwardly knocking, politely tapping the door again and again, but no one answered.\n[1964-04-12T11:10:30] Pasquale's house | I saw Antonio pointing at the door and saying something to his friend. I heard, \"Don't worry, I'll fix it for you.\"\n[1964-04-12T11:10:40] At Pasquale's house | I saw him grab the door handle, which was almost pulled off.\n[1964-04-12T11:10:45] Pasquale's House | I saw the door open.\n[1964-04-12T11:11:00] Elena's house | I know that Giuseppina Peluso has always been a very hardworking, kind, polite, and energetic woman who can face any setback.\n[1964-04-12T11:11:10] Elena's house | I know that ever since her husband was put in prison, she never gave up on him; I remember when her husband was arrested, and people said he had killed Don Achille, she fought with all her strength.\n[1964-04-12T11:11:20] Pasquale's House | I know that four years ago on New Year's Eve, she happily accepted Stefano's invitation and went to his house with a few children to celebrate; she was happy that the families had reconciled.\n[1964-04-12T11:11:30] Pasquale's House | I knew she was also happy when her daughter started working at the new Mergellina in Capodimonte with Lina's help.\n[1964-04-12T11:11:40] Elena's house | I saw her become small and pale, losing her former vitality, reduced to a skeleton. I know, but now her husband is dead. Obviously, she's grown tired. In just a few days, she's become so thin.\n[1964-04-12T11:11:50] Pasquale's house | I saw her take down the chain of the bathroom light and thread it through an iron hook fixed to the ceiling using a clothesline wire. She [tragic event]!\n[1964-04-12T11:12:00] Elena's house | I saw the scene before me, and Antonio was the first to break down and weep.\n[1964-04-12T11:12:10] Pasquale's House | I thought of the children of Giuseppina, Pinocchia and Pasquale, and they calmed me down more easily than he did.\n[1964-04-12T11:12:20] Elena's house | I saw Antonio speaking to me in a frightened voice. I heard, \"Did you see? She's not wearing any socks. Her nails are really long. One foot has freshly painted red nail polish, but the other has nothing at all!\"\n[1964-04-12T11:12:30] At Pasquale's house | I thought I had missed this detail, but he saw it.\n[1964-04-15T15:00:00] Funeral of Giuseppina | I saw Lina at Giuseppina's funeral, standing beside her husband; she embraced the weeping Pinocchia. I saw her and Stefano bringing a large wreath, with a purple banner that read, \"Sorrow for the Calahusbandwoman!\"\n[1964-04-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that after he returned from the army, even though he had mental problems, he felt he had to act like a man, and he was more convinced than ever that when danger came, he would be the first to charge forward without fear, and he would solve any problem. I thought about it, but I felt he was very fragile.\n[1964-04-25T10:00:00] Antonio's house | I know that for several weeks after this incident, he saw Giuseppina in every dark corner of the house, and his mental state grew even worse.\n[1964-04-30T10:00:00] Antonio's house | I did my best to help him, to calm him down, and I neglected some of my own affairs. I knew he was the only person in Mergellina who had a relatively close relationship with me, and this situation continued until I took my college entrance exam.\n[1964-05-15T12:00:00] School | I know that the final year of high school passed by in the blink of an eye, as if it were just a single day. I thought about how I spent my days struggling with astronomy, geography, geometry, and trigonometry, eager to understand everything.\n[1964-05-15T12:00:10] School | I thought about it, but I was actually clear-eyed enough to know that my foundation was weak and I couldn't overcome these problems, yet I liked doing my best.\n[1964-05-15T12:00:20] Various Places | I didn't know I had never been to the archaeological museum? I spent half a day quickly taking a look. I had never visited the Capodimonte Gallery? I went there and stayed for two hours before leaving. I know I don't have time to go to the cinema? I just remember the name and the plot of the movie.\n[1964-05-15T12:00:30] Near Martiri Square | I saw the store on Martirini Square that I had never been to. I thought, after all, I have so much to do, what does the shoes in the store on Martiri Square have to do with me?\n[1964-06-10T09:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I didn't go to Antonio anymore because of the exam. I know it was exactly during that time that two things happened to coincide.\n[1964-06-10T09:00:10] Near my home | I saw Antonio come to see me, and he told me he had accepted a job working for the Solara brothers. I saw that he looked much better.\n[1964-06-10T09:00:20] Near my home | I thought I didn't like the things he said at all, and I felt they were another manifestation of his illness.\n[1964-06-10T09:00:30] Near my house | I know that in order to protect his sister, he has been fighting with them since childhood. He, Pasquale, and Enzo once teamed up and gave Marcello and Michele a real beating, even smashing their Fiat 1100 car. I thought, logically, he should have hated the Solara brothers the most! Especially because he left me, and it was because I went to Marcello for help, hoping he wouldn't have to join the army.\n[1964-06-10T09:00:40] Near my house | I saw him trying to explain to me, but his words were all confused. Why is he now so obsequious?\n[1964-06-10T09:00:50] Near my home | I heard him say that when he was in the army, he learned one thing: a soldier should obey anyone higher in rank than himself. He said that order is better than no order. He said he learned how to sneak up behind someone and kill him without that person ever sensing his presence.\n[1964-06-10T09:01:00] Near my home | I knew he had gone to Solara's bar to look for a job, and Marcello naturally wouldn't miss the chance to humiliate and harass him. He then said he would give him some money every month, but didn't specify what exactly he was supposed to do, just told him to be on standby for instructions. I thought to myself, I understand now. His actions had something to do with his illness, but the biggest problem was—poverty.\n[1964-06-10T09:01:10] Near my home | I asked, \"Did you say 'awaiting orders'?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"What are we supposed to do when we're awaiting orders?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1964-06-10T09:01:20] Near my home | I saw it, but he didn't care. I said, \"Give it up, Anton! Don't get involved with them.\"\n[1964-06-15 10:00:00] School | I saw myself preparing for the final exams of my second year. I heard Lina tell me that in the spring, when she turned sixteen, she would get married.\n[1964-06-15 10:00:10] School | I thought of this news and felt very uneasy.\n[1964-06-15 10:00:20] School | I know Lina told me about her marriage in June, the very day I had my interview.\n[1964-06-15 10:00:30] School | Of course, their wedding was something predictable, but now that they've set the date—March twelfth—it feels like I've suddenly bumped my head against a door.\n[1964-06-15 10:00:40] School | I thought about the sordid ideas that had come to me, calculating the remaining months: nine.\n[1964-06-15 10:00:50] School | I thought maybe these nine months were enough for Pinochia's rejection, Maria's hostility, and Marcello's gossip to spread throughout the entire Mergellina, just like Aeneas' great achievements, becoming known to everyone, so that Stefano could no longer bear it and finally called off the engagement.\n[1964-06-15 10:01:00] School | I thought about how ashamed I was of myself, our fates had diverged, and I would never again be able to sketch a map that would connect them.\n[1964-06-15 10:01:10] School | I thought of that day very clearly, and it would make our lives drift further apart, deepening the chasm between us. Worst of all, her fate would be much better than mine.\n[1964-06-15 10:01:20] School | I thought that the more I thought about it, the more meaningless this path of study became. A few years ago, I took this road just to make Lina jealous.\n[1964-06-15 10:01:30] School | I thought about her, but what about her? Now she no longer pays attention to reading.",

I thought about my pitiful love experiences.\n[1964-06-15 22:00:10] Posillipo | I thought about the time I had a [close moment] with Gino, the son of the pharmacist; Nino's lips brushed against mine; and the hasty, dirty physical contact I had with his father— that was all.\n[1964-06-15 22:00:20] Posillipo | I thought of Lina, who would have a husband in March next year—when she turned sixteen—and within a year, when she was seventeen, would have a son, maybe other children as well.\n[1964-06-15 22:00:30] Posillipo | I saw myself crying out of despair. I thought about how I felt my life had no meaning.\n[1964-06-15T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that because of this job, he even ended up fighting with Pasquale and Enzo. I know Enzo has left the army; he's become even more silent and unyielding than before. Whether he's sick or not, they don't care—they can't forgive Antonio's choice.\n[1964-06-15T10:00:10] Mergellina | I saw Pasquale start to threaten Antonio, even though Antonio was his brother-in-law, he no longer wanted to see him. I knew that despite Pasquale being engaged to Pinocchia.\n[1964-06-16 09:00:00] School | I saw the next day, and I reluctantly went to take the exam. I thought of something, and then an event happened that made me feel better.\n[1964-06-16 09:10:00] Classroom | I saw that Teacher Girace and Teacher Galiani were the examiners, and they praised my Chinese.\n[1964-06-16 09:10:10] Classroom | I saw him about to read a passage from an essay I had written to the other teachers. I heard, especially Teacher Girace, who said my essay is getting better and better.\n[1964-06-16 09:10:20] Classroom | I heard him read that passage and immediately realized it was the writing exercise I had started several months ago.\n[1964-06-16 09:10:30] Classroom | I thought about how I would no longer use that affected tone, no longer rely on rigid sentences, but instead try to write in a smooth and engaging style, like the one Lina used in her letter to me when I was at Vomero.\n[1964-06-16 09:10:40] Classroom | I heard the teacher reading my essay, and Teacher Galiani listened silently, nodding all the while.\n[1964-06-16 09:10:50] Classroom | I thought to myself: I realized, I did it.\n[1964-06-16 09:11:00] Classroom | I thought, of course, that wasn't Lina's writing style, it was my own, as if in the teacher's eyes, it was a particularly admirable style.\n[1964-06-17 10:00:00] Posillipo | I knew I had advanced to senior year, and I got full marks in every subject, but at home, no one was surprised, and no one celebrated for me.\n[1964-06-17 10:00:10] Posillipo | I saw that they were all satisfied, it was true. I felt happy about it, but they didn't think it was a big deal at all.\n[1964-06-17 10:00:20] Posillipo | I thought about how my mother took it for granted that I did well in school.\n[1964-06-17 10:00:30] Posillipo | I saw my father say that I should go immediately to Teacher Oliviero's house to get the textbooks for the next school year. I heard my mother shouting after me as I left: \"If she asks you to go to Vomero again, tell her I'm not feeling well and you have to stay home to help me!\"\n[1964-07-01T09:00:00] My room | I saw myself pulling out of these troubles and focusing all my energy on the college entrance exam. I studied day and night.\n[1964-07-01T14:00:00] My room | Sometimes when the weather was too hot and unbearable, I would temporarily set aside my studies. I thought about my memories of the previous summer, especially those days in July—the happy time I spent with Lina and Nino before Pinocchia left, or at least what I thought was a happy time.\n[1964-07-01T14:05:00] My room | I saw it, but I quickly dispelled those memories, the scene, and the words that had been spoken. I thought I couldn't afford to lose focus.\n[1964-07-10T10:00:00] Exam Room | I saw that in two hours I had written an essay about \"nature\" in the poetry of the Italian romantic poet Giacomo Leopardi, incorporating some lines I had memorized and elegant phrases I had learned from the textbook on Italian literature. I knew this exam would have a decisive impact on my life.\n[1964-07-11T10:00:00] Exam Room | I saw that I had successfully drawn the attention of the proctor, and she smiled at me several times. I remember especially a very old, extremely thin female teacher who wore a pink suit, had sky-blue hair, as if she had just come out of a hairdresser's. I know that especially in the Latin and Greek exams, I did very well. When I handed in my paper, my classmates, including Alfonso Carracci, were just starting to work on the questions.\n[1964-07-15 21:00:00] By the pond | I realized I had developed feelings for Antonio without even noticing. Our sexual games became bolder and more enjoyable.\n[1964-07-15 21:00:10] By the pond | I thought about what I wanted to ask Lina the next time she came to \"Beihai Park\"—what would happen when she and Stefano drove off alone.\n[1964-07-15 21:00:20] By the pond | I wondered if they were going to do what I did with Antonio, or even be bolder and do the things the Solara brothers had mentioned?\n[1964-07-15 21:00:30] By the pond | I thought that something like this I couldn't talk to anyone about—I could only communicate with her. But I never got the chance to ask her those questions, because she never came back to \"The Seaside Park\" again.\n[1964-07-15T09:00:00] Borgo | I opened my eyes and wanted to find a phone to call Alfonso Carracci. I wanted to know if Lina had given birth, how she was doing, and whether she was happy. I thought about it, but at the time I might have needed to study or take an exam—I've forgotten which—and so I never made the call later.\n[1964-07-15T10:00:00] Oral Exam Room | I saw that all the teachers praised me, and I especially received recognition from the female teacher with blue hair. I thought the real good luck happened during the oral exam. My statement deeply moved her, not just because of what I said, but also because of the way I expressed it.\n[1964-07-15T10:05:00] Oral Exam Room | I heard her say, \"You write very well.\" \"Thank you,\" I said. I thought her accent was unfamiliar, but I knew, it was the accent from a place very far away from San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1964-07-15T10:05:30] Oral Exam Room | \"I heard, 'You really think that nothing is eternal, not even poetry?' 'That's what Leopardi thought.' 'Are you sure?' 'Yes.'\"\n[1964-07-15T10:06:00] Oral Exam Room | I heard, \"What do you think?\" \"I think that all beautiful things are also a kind of deception.\" \"Like the garden in Leopardi's work?\"\n[1964-07-15T10:06:30] Oral Exam Room | I heard her say, \"Yes, like a clear sea surface, a streak of sunset, or the night sky—each is a cover for terror. If you remove what's on the surface, all that remains is fear.\" I thought I had never really read Leopardi's garden, but I answered.\n[1964-07-15T10:07:00] Oral Exam Room | I felt my thoughts flowing like a spring, and I spoke naturally. I thought, but in reality, none of it was spontaneous—I just repeated what I had written in the written exam.\n[1964-07-15T10:07:30] Oral Exam Room | I heard, \"Which major do you want to study in college?\" I realized I didn't even know what my major was, I knew almost nothing about it, and those words were foreign to me.\n[1964-07-15T10:07:45] Oral Exam Room | I saw that I could only avoid this issue. I heard myself say, \"I'll go for the interview.\"\n[1964-07-15T10:08:00] Oral examination room | I heard, \"You're not going to college?\" \"No.\" I felt my face grow hot, as if I couldn't hide some mistake.\n[1964-07-15T10:08:15] Oral Exam Room | \"I heard 'Do you need work?' 'Yes.'\"",

A while later, the teacher came into the corridor and walked up to me, talking to me for a long time about a college related to Borgo. I heard her say that if I took an exam like the one just now, I could go to college for free.\n[1964-07-15T10:20:00] Corridor | I heard, \"If you come here in two days, I'll explain all the documents you need to prepare.\" I thought of how I listened to her speak, as if listening to something that would never truly be connected to me.\n[1964-07-17T10:00:00] School | Two days later, I returned to school. I thought it was only because I felt that if I didn't go, the teacher would get angry and give me a bad grade.\n[1964-07-17T10:30:00] School | I saw her giving me a lot of very detailed information and helping me fill out a form. I thought about the information that shocked me; I never saw her again, and I didn't even know her name, yet I was full of gratitude for her.\n[1964-07-17T10:40:00] School | I saw her embrace me naturally and affectionately. I know she has always addressed me with \"you.\"\n[1964-07-30T10:00:00] School | I know the exam is over, and I've passed it, scoring an average of nine points per subject; Alfonso Carracci also did well, with an average of seven points. I thought that, before I left that middle school forever, before leaving that gray, dilapidated building without the slightest regret, its only value in my eyes was that Nino had also taught there.\n[1964-07-30T10:10:00] School | I saw Teacher Galiani, and I went over to greet her. I heard her congratulate me on achieving such excellent results. I saw it, but there was no warmth in her voice.\n[1964-07-30T10:15:00] School | I saw that she hadn't recommended any books for me to read in the summer, nor had she asked what I would do after getting my high school diploma. I thought the misunderstanding between us had already been cleared up, but her cold tone made me feel angry.\n[1964-07-30T10:16:00] School | I know that before, it was Nino who left his daughter and never came back. I realized where the problem was? She thought I was unreliable and unserious, just like Nino, all of us untrustworthy people? I've become used to winning everyone's favor, and others' affection toward me has always been a bright, shiny armor for me.\n[1964-07-30T10:20:00] School | I saw that Teacher Galiani no longer paid attention to me, which prompted me to make an important decision—I applied to Borgo Normal University. It made me feel sad; I didn't talk to anyone about my decision (if not Galiani, then who else could I talk to?).\n[1964-08-15T09:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself starting to work hard to earn money. All of August, I was busy every day. I took on several students who needed tutoring: Latin, Greek, history, philosophy, even mathematics. I knew that because I had taught the children of some wealthy families for a year, they were very satisfied with my work and said I taught well, so my reputation spread.\n[1964-08-15T10:00:00] Vesilia | I remember August, when I finished my homework and exams, I didn't go home. I wrote a letter to my parents, told a few lies, and then went on vacation to the seaside in Vesuvia with Franco Mari, who had a house there. I thought about that place, where I first wore a bikini: the swimsuit was tiny, the size of a single hand, and I felt very bold.\n[1964-08-16 10:00:00] Stationery Store | I knew that after the Feast of the Assumption on August 15th, my work would be over, and the joy of the sea and the sun would also come to an end.\n[1964-08-16 10:10:00] Stationery Store | I saw the stationery shop owner was very satisfied with me, and I had taken good care of her three daughters. I thought about how, despite my repeated instructions that they shouldn't tell my mother about Antonio, they still did, and sometimes a young man would jump with them.\n[1964-08-16 10:15:00] Stationery Store | I saw the stationery shop owner didn't mock me at all, but instead hugged me. I heard someone say to me: \"That's great, you should be more open. For your age, you're too conservative, too responsible.\"\n[1964-08-16 10:15:10] Stationery Store | I heard her out, and then she said with a bit of contempt, \"Think about what Lina Lina does every day.\"\n[1964-08-16 21:00:00] By the pond | I heard myself say to Antonio, \"It's always been this way, since we were little. Everyone thought: she was a bad girl, and I was the good one.\"\n[1964-08-16 21:00:10] By the pond | I saw him [intimate act] me. I heard her say with a touch of sarcasm, \"Why do you say that? Isn't that true?\"\n[1964-08-16 21:00:20] By the pond | I thought about his answer, which made me soften inside. I couldn't bring myself to say the words that we had to break up.\n[1964-08-16 21:00:30] By the pond | I thought about this decision, which was very urgent for me. We had feelings, but not love. I loved Nino, and I knew I would always love Nino.\n[1964-08-16 21:00:40] By the pond | I thought about the dialogue I had prepared for Antonio, and I wanted to calmly tell him: The time we spent together was very beautiful, and he helped me get through a very low period in my life.\n[1964-08-16 21:00:50] By the pond | I thought about it, but now school has started. This year, I have many new courses, and it's going to be a very difficult year. I have to study very hard. I feel very sorry, but we have to part ways.\n[1964-08-16 21:01:00] By the pond | I thought about how every afternoon when I went to the pond, I felt like I was about to say those words, but he looked at me with such deep affection and passion, and I lacked the courage, so I kept holding them back.\n[1964-08-28T09:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I didn't start preparing until the days before I left, taking only a few worn-out clothes and very few books.\n[1964-08-28T09:10:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my mother speaking out in anger. \"I heard, 'If you make some money, send it back to us through the post office. Ah—! Who's going to help your younger brothers with their homework now? If you leave, their studies will fall behind. Go ahead! Hurry up and leave, who cares? I've always known that you've always thought you were better than me, better than everyone else.'\"\n[1964-08-28T09:20:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard my father's exaggerated, sorrowful words next: \"I'm in pain here, I don't know what's wrong. Come to Daddy, Elena! When you come back, I might not be alive anymore.\"\n[1964-08-28T10:00:00] Mergellina | I heard my brothers and sisters keep asking me, \"If we go to find you, can we stay at your place? Can we eat with you?\"\n[1964-08-28T11:00:00] Mergellina | I saw him finally, Pasquale told me, and also Pinochia. She's very fragile mentally; she hasn't recovered from her mother's death yet. She greeted me, then suddenly started crying. I heard, \"You need to be more careful, don't just focus on your studies and forget who you are, Elena! You must remember where you come from and your position.\"\n[1964-08-28T11:30:00] Mergellina | I saw Alfonso Carracci had arrived too, and he said in a low voice, shocked. I heard, \"I knew you'd keep studying.\"\n[1964-08-28T12:00:00] Mergellina | I saw then Antonio, who didn't listen to a word I was saying, didn't know where he was going or what he was doing, and kept repeating it over and over. \"I feel much better now, Elena! Everything is over, it was all because of the army, and now I'm fine.\"\n[1964-08-28T13:00:00] Mergellina | I saw him, then Enzo, who just grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard. I saw something that made me hurt for days.\n[1964-08-28T14:00:00] Mergellina | I saw it was Pinocchio, she just asked me, I smiled, and she said again. \"I heard, 'Did you tell Lina? Did you tell her?' 'You should tell her, otherwise she'll surely die of anger.'\"\n[1964-08-29T10:00:00] Mergellina | I thought to myself, Alfonso Carracci must have already told Lina that I was going to university at Borgo, or maybe Pinocchia, or perhaps her husband would tell her, because Pinocchia would definitely mention it to Stefano.\n[1964-08-29T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know it's been more than a year, and when we meet, we just exchange a brief greeting. I thought that if she hadn't come to congratulate me on her own, it must have been because the news unsettled her; now I was specifically going to see her about this, which would surely be inopportune, and I didn't want to tell her face-to-face about my good fortune.",

After August fifteenth, it was almost the end of the month.\n[1964-08-30 16:00:10] Posillipo | I thought to myself: When you have only some feelings for someone, not love, in such a case, you can't engage in intimate acts, touch them, or let them touch you.\n[1964-08-30 16:00:20] Posillipo | I thought that Lina loved Stefano, but I didn't love Antonio.\n[1964-08-30T10:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I put the issue aside and focused on finishing the last few things I needed to do before leaving. I thought this was also an opportunity for me to say goodbye to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1964-08-30T10:30:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had written a letter to Nella, telling her about what had happened to me, and I asked her for Professor Oliviero's address. I thought about telling the teacher the good news.\n[1964-08-30T11:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I went to visit a cousin of my father's who had promised to give me an old suitcase, then I went around to the families where I had worked as a tutor and collected the remaining payment for my last few lessons.\n[1964-08-30T12:00:00] City Area | I saw myself crossing Garibaldi Street, walking up to Court Road, arriving at Dante Square, and then taking a bus.\n[1964-08-30T13:00:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I went to Piazza del Plebiscito, first walking around the Via Scarpetti, then to Santarella, and finally I took the cable car to Piazza Amadeo.\n[1964-08-30T15:00:00] Amadeo Square | I saw all the mothers of my students, and they all felt sorry for me, reluctant to part with me. Besides paying me for my lessons, they also treated me to coffee, and almost all of them gave me a gift.\n[1964-08-30T16:00:00] Near Martiri Square | When that day's schedule ended, I found myself very close to Piazza Martiri; I walked onto Via Ferrante, unsure of what I was going to do.\n[1964-08-30T16:05:00] Ferrangieri Road | I thought back to the opening day of the shoe store: Lina was dressed very extravagantly, but inside she was still very uneasy. She worried that she hadn't really changed, that she was still different from those girls in the wealthy neighborhood, not as refined as they were.\n[1964-08-30T16:06:00] Ferrangieri Road | I thought to myself, now I really have changed. Although I've always been wearing those ragged clothes, I have a high school diploma, and I'm about to go to university at Borgo.\n[1964-08-30T16:07:00] Ferrangeri Road | I thought that I wasn't just changing on the surface, but fundamentally, and naturally, the surface would also change soon—and not just a superficial change. The idea of that made me feel very happy.\n[1964-08-30T16:10:00] Optician's Shop | I stopped at the window of the optical shop and studied the display of eyeglass frames. Yes, I thought, I should get a new pair of glasses. The ones I'm wearing now hide my face; I need a lighter frame.\n[1964-08-30T16:15:00] Optical Shop | I saw a pair of round-rimmed glasses, fairly thin, with large lenses. I thought about how I would tie my hair up, how I would learn to put on makeup.\n[1964-08-30T16:20:00] Martiri Square | I saw myself leaving the optician's window and arriving at Martirini Square. I saw that at the time, many shops had their roll-down doors down, and the roll-down door of the Solara shoe store was down three-quarters of the way.\n[1964-08-30T16:21:00] Martiri Square | I looked around me. I realized I didn't know Lina's current habits at all, not even the slightest bit.\n[1964-08-30T16:22:00] Martiri Square | I knew that when she started working at the new Capodimonte, even though her home was just a few steps away, she wouldn't go home for lunch. She would stay in the shop and have something to eat with Pinochia, or sometimes after school I would go find her, and she would chat with me for a while. I thought that now she was working at Piazza Martiri, it was even less likely she'd come home for lunch—it would be too much trouble, and there wasn't enough time anyway.\n[1964-08-30T16:23:00] Martiri Square | I thought maybe she was now in some cocktail bar, perhaps accompanied by a saleswoman from the shoe store, taking a walk on the sea, or maybe she was resting in the shop.\n[1964-08-30T16:24:00] At the shoe store entrance | I saw myself raising my hand and patting the metal shutter door. No one answered. I knocked again, but still no one responded.\n[1964-08-30T16:25:00] At the shoe store entrance | I called out a few times and heard footsteps inside. I heard Lina's voice ask, \"Who is it?\" \"Elena.\" \"Elena!\" I heard her shout.\n[1964-08-30T16:26:00] Shoe Store | I saw her pull up the roller door and appear before me. I thought about how it had been a long time since I'd seen her, not even catching a distant glimpse of her shadow, and I felt she had changed.\n[1964-08-30T16:27:00] Shoe Store | I saw her wearing a white blouse, a blue fitted skirt, and her hairstyle and makeup were as meticulously done as always. I thought of her, but her face seemed to have become wider and flatter, and I felt her whole body had also become wider and flatter.\n[1964-08-30T16:28:00] Shoe Store | I saw her pull me inside, then lower the metal shutter. I saw that the store was brightly lit and luxurious, its furnishings had changed completely. It really no longer looked like a shoe shop but more like a salon.\n[1964-08-30T16:29:00] Shoe Store | I heard her say a heartfelt thing: \"Elena, you've had a big good fortune, I'm really glad you came to say goodbye to me.\" I thought she certainly knew about the Borgo Academy, and I felt she was sincere.\n[1964-08-30T16:30:00] Shoe Store | I saw her tightly embrace me, kiss both of my cheeks, and her eyes were full of tears. I heard her keep saying, \"I'm so happy.\" Then she shouted at the bathroom door, \"Come out! Nino, you can come out now, it's Elena.\"\n[1964-08-30T16:31:00] Shoe Store | I saw the bathroom door open, and there was Nino, just as he usually was, his head down, his hands in his pockets, his expression tense. I saw myself and felt like I couldn't breathe.\n[1964-08-30T16:32:00] Shoe Store | I didn't know what to say to him, so I reached out my hand, and he weakly shook it. I heard \"Hello.\" He said softly.\n[1964-08-30T16:35:00] Shoe Store | I saw Lina, at that moment, briefly and clearly told me something very important. I knew they had been meeting secretly for almost a year. For my own good, she decided not to involve me anymore in this messy deception, because if they were discovered, I would also be in trouble.\n[1964-08-30T16:36:00] Shoe Store | I know she's been pregnant for two months now, and she's going to confess everything to Stefano. She wants to leave him.\n[1964-08-30T16:40:00] Shoe Store | I saw Lina speaking in a tone I was familiar with, that very decisive tone, devoid of any emotional color. She simply stated the facts quickly. I saw her almost speaking with a tone of disdain, as if she were worried that if her voice trembled even slightly, or if her lower lip betrayed an involuntary shake, everything would break loose, overflowing and leaving her utterly undone.\n[1964-08-30T16:41:00] Shoe Store | I saw Nino sitting on the sofa, his head down. He merely nodded slightly, showing his approval. I know they've been holding hands all along.\n[1964-08-30T16:45:00] Shoe Store | I saw her say that they met nervously in the shoe shop, and the end result was that she took a pregnancy test and found out she was pregnant. Now they had to make a decision; they couldn't go on like this anymore.\n[1964-08-30T16:46:00] Shoe Store | \"I can't take it anymore,\" she said, \"we have to live together.\" I knew she and Nino needed their own house, their own life, and she wanted to share with him friendship, books, lectures, movies, theater, and music.\n[1964-08-30T16:47:00] Shoe Store | I knew she had saved up some money and was planning to rent a house in the Flegre district, paying two million lira a month. They would live there waiting for the baby to be born.\n[1964-08-30T16:48:00] Shoe Store | I couldn't help but say: \"What's the point in leaving Stefano? You're good at lying, you've already told him so many lies, you can keep on doing it.\" How could it be like this? No job? Nino still has to study?\n[1964-08-30T16:49:00] Shoe Store | I saw her squinting at me. I thought of how she clearly sensed the sarcasm, hostility, and contempt hidden beneath my well-meaning advice as a friend.\n[1964-08-30T16:50:00] Shoe Store | I saw her also look up at Nino, who suddenly raised his head. His lips were half-closed, as if he wanted to say something but held back to avoid an argument.\n[1964-08-30T16:51:00] Shoe Store | I heard her answer: \"Lying was to avoid getting beaten, but now I'd rather be killed than live like this.\"\n[1964-08-30T16:55:00] Shoe Store | When I said goodbye to them, I wished them all the best. I thought to myself that for my own sake, I hoped never to see them again.",

I thought about her, but she knew that her husband would soon find her.\n[1964-08-30T17:01:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her trying to ask Alfonso Carracci, asking him if Pinocchia knew when her brother would return from Vomero. I thought about it, but she was worried that her brother-in-law might tell her husband, so she didn't ask.\n[1964-08-30T17:02:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her find Nino's number in the phone directory, and she called. It was Donato who answered, and she said she was a friend of Nino's. He didn't say much before hanging up. I heard a note of irritation in her voice.\n[1964-08-30T17:03:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how desperate she was, even to the point of wanting to take a boat to Vomero.\n[1964-08-31T20:00:00] My home | At the end of August, I realized I had made a lot of money, totaling seventy-seven thousand lira. I gave fifty thousand lira to my mother.\n[1964-08-31T20:05:00] My kitchen | I saw her almost snatch the money from my hands and hide it in her bra. I saw her reaction was very exaggerated, as if we weren't in our own kitchen, but on the street. I thought about how she was worried the money might be stolen.\n[1964-08-31T20:10:00] My home | I saw that I had left myself two million lira, and I hid the money.\n[1964-09-01 10:00:00] Mergellina | I thought about it for a while, but I never found the right moment to talk to him.\n[1964-09-01 10:00:10] Mergellina | I saw he was worried because Melina's condition usually worsened in the heat. I thought about how this deterioration would become very obvious in late August.\n[1964-09-01 10:00:20] Mergellina | I saw her again and thought of Nino—the one she called Donato. I heard her say she saw Donato, that he had come back for her, and none of the children could calm her down.\n[1964-09-01 10:00:30] Mergellina | I felt sad thinking about it, because if Nino really appeared on Mergellina's street, he would be looking for me, not for Melina.\n[1964-09-01 23:00:00] My room | I saw at night, sometimes I would suddenly wake up. I thought he had somehow crawled in through the window and was staying in my room.\n[1964-09-01 23:30:00] My room | I thought about it until I finally calmed down, and I told myself he might be in Balano, on vacation at the Maronti beach, instead of here, where the weather was so hot and everywhere full of flies and dust.\n[1964-09-01T20:00:00] My home | I didn't tell the people from Posillipo that I was going to Borgo for an exam until the day before I left. \"I said, 'If they accept me, I'll go to school and it won't cost my family a penny.'\"\n[1964-09-01T20:01:00] My home | I saw myself speaking in Italian, saying it firmly. I thought that speaking in dialect would make these words less meaningful, as if my father, mother, and younger brother and sister shouldn't, and couldn't, understand what I was doing.\n[1964-09-01T20:02:00] My home | I saw that they were actually uncomfortable when I said these things to them. I thought that in their eyes, I was no longer myself, but a stranger who had come to visit at the wrong time.\n[1964-09-01T20:05:00] My home | I saw him until my father said, then he went to sleep. I heard, \"Do whatever you want, but remember, we can't help you.\" My younger sister asked if she could go with me.\n[1964-09-02T06:00:00] My home | I said nothing to my mother, but before leaving, she put five thousand lire on the table for me.\n[1964-09-02T06:05:00] My home | I stared at the money for a long time, I didn't touch it. I thought about how it was as if I were going to take that money and waste it, doing something reckless.\n[1964-09-02T06:10:00] My home | I saw it through, and still managed to break through my psychological barrier; I took the money. I thought to myself: This is my money!\n[1964-09-02T07:00:00] On the train | I know I'm leaving San Gregorio Armeno for the first time, leaving the Campania region. I thought about how I had come to fear everything: I was afraid of taking the wrong train, afraid of needing to urinate but not finding a restroom, worried that if it got dark, I'd get lost in an unfamiliar city, worried about being robbed.\n[1964-09-02T08:00:00] On the train | I saw that, just like my mother, I had put all my money in my bra. I thought about it for several hours, spending them in a state of anxious uncertainty, yet I also felt strangely free.\n[1964-09-03 09:00:00] Street | I was out getting something when I heard someone calling me. I turned around.\n[1964-09-03 09:00:10] Street | I didn't recognize him at first, but then I looked more carefully. I saw his black beard, his tanned, sharply defined face, and his thin lips.\n[1964-09-03 09:00:20] Street | I took a step back, and he followed.\n[1964-09-03 09:00:30] Street | I heard him say that he hadn't found me at Balano's house, at Nella's, and he was sad.\n[1964-09-03 09:00:40] Street | I heard him say that he had been thinking of me all along, and that he didn't know how to live without me.\n[1964-09-03 09:00:50] Street | I heard him say that for our love, he would write many poems and read them to me.\n[1964-09-03 09:01:00] Street | I heard him say he wanted to see me, to talk to me without any restraint. If I refused him, he would [tragic event].\n[1964-09-03 09:01:10] Street | I saw myself stop, and I said to him word by word. I heard him say, \"Please don't bother me anymore. I already have a boyfriend. I don't want to see him again.\"\n[1964-09-03 09:01:20] Street | I saw him getting really frustrated, and he muttered that he would wait for me forever, that every noon he would be waiting for me at the entrance to the main road Mercato. I heard myself shake my head firmly and say, \"I will never go there.\"\n[1964-09-03 09:01:30] Street | I saw him coming toward me to [intimate act], so I took a step back. I thought of a face full of hatred.\n[1964-09-03 09:01:40] Street | I saw him give a helpless smile and whisper. I heard, \"You are very talented, very sensitive. I will bring you some of my favorite poems.\"\n[1964-09-03 09:01:50] Street | I saw it and then turned and walked away.\n[1964-09-03 10:00:00] Street | I thought about how terrified I was, not knowing what to do. I decided to seek help from Antonio.\n[1964-09-03 20:00:00] By the pond | I heard that night, by the pond, I told him, she was right—Donato Nino was hanging around in this Mergellina, he stopped me on the way and told me to tell Melina that he would be waiting for her, that every day at noon he would be waiting for her at the entrance of Mercato.\n[1964-09-03 20:00:10] By the pond | I saw Antonio's face grow dark. I heard him say in a low voice, \"What should I do?\"\n[1964-09-03 20:00:20] By the pond | I heard myself say to him that I would go with him to the meeting, and that we would clear things up with Nino and talk about his mother's current health condition.\n[1964-09-03T09:00:00] Borgo | I knew the teacher with the sky-blue hair hadn't told me that this exam would be harder than the high school graduation exam, especially Latin, which was absolutely impossible for me, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. I thought I felt everything was getting better—except for the exams; each exam was a cruel test of my abilities.\n[1964-09-03T10:00:00] Exam Room 004 | I saw myself becoming hesitant and stammering, I often pretended to know the answer but couldn't get it out.",

I see you're boldly discussing some issues, but you completely ignore the structure an article should have.\" I saw that my Chinese teacher's attitude toward me was terrible, as if my voice also annoyed him.\n[1964-09-03T11:05:00] Exam Room 004 | I saw that the teacher had noticed it too. He looked at me with a mocking expression and told me to talk about the books I'd read recently. I thought I felt depressed, my confidence completely gone. I imagined that what he had said was about the work of some Italian writer, but I hadn't understood it at the time.\n[1964-09-03T11:10:00] Exam Room 004 | I saw myself clinging to something that flashed through my mind—only Samuel Beckett's Dan Rooney, which I had read on Cetrara Beach, and I began to speak. I know that the blind man Dan Rooney, even though he was already blind, still wanted to become deaf and mute...\n[1964-09-03T11:15:00] Exam Room Borgo | I saw him cut me off quickly and hand me over to the history teacher. I saw the teacher's mocking expression, and I gradually became uneasy and confused.\n[1964-09-03T12:00:00] Exam Room 004 | I saw the history teacher asking me a series of detailed questions. I thought the situation hadn't improved at all. In the end, I had never felt as ignorant as I did then. Even in the years when I was studying the worst and performing the worst on exams, my situation had never been so desperate.\n[1964-09-03T12:15:00] Exam Room Borgo | I could answer all the questions, but in a very general way; as soon as he asked me a more specific question, I couldn't answer.\n[1964-09-03T12:20:00] Exam Room 004 | I heard him say, full of disgust, \"Other than school textbooks, have you never read anything else?\" I replied, \"I studied the concept of the nation-state.\"\n[1964-09-03T12:21:00] Exam Room 004 | I heard him say, \"Let's see how much you understood.\" He listened carefully to me for a few minutes, then suddenly told me to stop. I heard, \"Do you remember the author of the book?\" \"Federico Cappo.\" I thought about how I had said a lot of foolish things.\n[1964-09-03T13:00:00] Borgo | I saw that I had been crying for a long time. I thought, feeling that because of my recklessness, I had personally thrown away my future.\n[1964-09-03T13:05:00] Borgo | I thought, then I thought again: it was foolish of me to be so desperate. I knew all along that I was never really outstanding; Lina was truly outstanding, and Nino too. I was just vain, and now I've been punished for it.\n[1964-09-04 02:00:00] Posillipo | I thought about it all night and couldn't sleep because I was so worried.\n[1964-09-04 12:00:00] Mercato | I saw that the next day we went to Mercato.\n[1964-09-04 12:00:10] Mercato | I saw Antonio say nothing, walking slowly and calmly. I thought I sensed his heavy mood, his steps growing slower and slower.\n[1964-09-04 12:00:20] Mercato | I thought, on one hand, he was very angry; on the other hand, he felt extremely uncomfortable.\n[1964-09-04 12:00:30] Mercato | I thought, angry with myself: He had been willing to challenge the Solara brothers for his sister, for Lina, but now he had become timid. Donato Nino was an important and respected figure in his eyes.\n[1964-09-04 12:00:40] Mercato | I saw and felt his shyness, which made me more determined. I really wanted to shake him. I thought of shouting at him: \"You've never written a book, but you're far better than that man!\"\n[1964-09-04 12:00:50] Mercato | I saw it, but I just held his arm.\n[1964-09-04 12:01:00] Mercato | I saw Nino spotting us from afar and wanted to vanish immediately into the darkness of Mercato.\n[1964-09-04 12:01:10] Mercato | I heard myself calling out to him: \"Mr. Nino.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:01:20] Mercato | I saw him reluctantly turn around.\n[1964-09-04 12:01:30] Mercato | I heard, \"I don't know, do you remember Antonio? He was Mrs. Melina's oldest son.\" I knew I was addressing him with respect, and in our circumstances at that time, this wasn't very common.\n[1964-09-04 12:01:40] Mercato | I heard Nino speaking in a feigned voice, full of emotion: \"Of course I remember. Hello, Antonio.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:01:50] Mercato | I heard, \"He's my boyfriend.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:02:00] Mercato | I heard, \"Ah! Very good.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:02:10] Mercato | I heard, \"We've talked a lot already, now let him speak to you.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:02:20] Mercato | I saw Antonio understand that it was his turn to speak, his face very pale and his expression very tense.\n[1964-09-04 12:02:30] Mercato | I heard him speak in standard Italian, struggling to say: \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Nino. I can't forget all that you did for my family after my father died.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:02:40] Mercato | I heard, \"I especially want to thank you for arranging for me to work at Mr. Gherasio's garage, where I learned a trade.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:02:50] Mercato | I heard, \"Tell him about your mother.\" I thought to myself, I was very impatient and reminded him.\n[1964-09-04 12:03:00] Mercato | I saw that he was also upset, and he gestured for me to be quiet. I heard him continue: \"But you don't live in this neighborhood anymore. You don't understand the situation. Just hearing your name would drive my mother crazy. If she saw you again, even once, she'd end up in the asylum.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:03:10] Mercato | I saw Nino looking a bit flustered. I heard, \"Antonio, my child, I never meant to hurt your mother. You mentioned it yourself, how much I care about you all. Actually, I just wanted to help her, and your whole family.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:03:20] Mercato | I heard, \"So, if you're going to continue helping her, don't look for her anymore, don't send her books, don't let her see you in this Mergellina.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:03:30] Mercato | \"I can't ask you for that. You can't stop me from seeing the place I'm attached to.\" Nino said in a heated voice, laced with insincere emotion.\n[1964-09-04 12:03:40] Mercato | I thought of that tone, and it made me angry. I knew that tone well—back in Balano, on the beach at Maronti, he often used it. It was a soft, sticky tone.\n[1964-09-04 12:03:50] Mercato | I thought he saw himself as a man with depth, someone who had written a book of poetry and published articles in the newspaper; he thought he should speak in that kind of tone.\n[1964-09-04 12:04:00] Mercato | I was about to speak, but to my surprise, Antonio spoke first.\n[1964-09-04 12:04:10] Mercato | I saw him shrug his shoulders, lower his head, and stretch out a hand, pushing Donato Nino's chest with his strong fingers.\n[1964-09-04 12:04:20] Mercato | I heard him speak in the local dialect: \"I won't stop you. But I assure you, if you make my mother lose the last of her sanity, I'll make sure you never want to see this damn place again!\"\n[1964-09-04 12:04:30] Mercato | I saw Nino turn very pale.\n[1964-09-04 12:04:40] Mercato | \"I see,\" he said hurriedly, \"I understand, thank you.\"\n[1964-09-04 12:04:50] Mercato | I saw him turn and walk quickly toward the train station.\n[1964-09-04 12:05:00] Mercato | I saw myself holding Antonio's arm, proud of his efforts, but I noticed he was trembling.\n[1964-09-04 12:05:10] Mercato | I thought about what I thought--perhaps it was the first time I had ever thought, from childhood on, first his father's death, then work, and after his mother's breakdown, the burden that fell upon his shoulders.\n[1964-09-04 12:05:20] Mercato | I saw myself lovingly pulling him away. I thought to myself that I had set another deadline—I would break up with him after Lina got married.",

I knew, but in reality, I passed the exam later.\n[1964-09-05T10:05:00] Borgo | I knew I—Elena Greco, daughter of a building superintendent—would finally be free of this Mergellina at nineteen, I was leavin gSan Gregorio Armeno, all alone!\n[1964-09-15 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that wedding is unforgettable for everyone in the neighborhood. The preparation for the wedding and the long, meticulous, and contentious creation of \"Lina\" shoes were intertwined, as if, for different reasons, both things were always difficult to complete.\n[1964-09-15 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I knew that, in addition to everything else, this wedding would have a big impact on the shoe shop. Fernando and Rino had been working hard to make the new shoes, and up until then, they hadn't made any money from it.\n[1964-09-15 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I know that they also have to be busy with countless other small tasks, those that can bring immediate profit, because they are in urgent need of money.\n[1964-09-15 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I knew they would raise a considerable amount of money for Lina's dowry, in addition to covering the costs of the wedding banquet.\n[1964-09-15 10:00:40] Lina's house | I know they tried every possible way not to appear too poor at that moment, and the result was that for several months, the atmosphere in Lina's house remained tense.\n[1964-09-15 10:00:50] Lina's house | I know that Nunzia has been stitching bed linens day and night, and Fernando has been complaining, sighing, full of regret, saying how happy his previous times were, when in his little shop he was a king, with a pin in his mouth, calmly applying glue, sewing, and hammering.\n[1964-09-20 16:00:00] Lina's house | I know that the only happy couple is the newlyweds.\n[1964-09-20 16:00:10] Lina's house | I know there were only two small conflicts between them. The first was about their future house. Stefano wanted to buy a place in the new neighborhood, while Lina preferred an apartment in the old building.\n[1964-09-20 16:00:20] Lina's House | I know they discussed it. The Mergellina house was big, but the lighting was bad and the view wasn't good either. Most of the houses at Mergellina were like that.\n[1964-09-20 16:00:30] New Community | I knew the new apartment was a bit small, but there was a huge bathtub in it, just like the one in the \"Santoor\" bathroom ad, and there was also a bidet. The windows faced Mount Vesuvius.\n[1964-09-20 16:00:40] New Community | I know that from a distance, under the misty sky, Mount Vesuvius is just a dim silhouette, and only a hundred meters away from the house, the shiny iron tracks are constantly filled with trains coming and going.\n[1964-09-20 16:00:50] New Community | I knew Stefano was fascinated by the new neighborhood, with its polished floors and white walls, and Lina quickly gave in.\n[1964-09-20 16:01:00] New Community | I don't need to say anything else—she'll own her own house before she's seventeen, with hot water flowing from the taps, and the house won't be rented, it'll be hers to buy.\n[1964-09-20 16:01:10] Lina's house | I know that the second conflict arose over the honeymoon trip. Stefano suggested going to Venice, and Lina proposed a route she liked, which had an important impact on her later life; she never wanted to be far away from San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1964-09-20 16:01:20] Lina's house | I knew she suggested going to Vomero, or maybe Vomero, saying the Amalfi Coast was also an option—those were places she'd never been to, and her fiancé immediately agreed.\n[1964-09-30 16:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I know the rest are all small issues, all caused by the difference in their family backgrounds.\n[1964-09-30 16:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I know, for example, that after Stefano went to Lina's workshop, things always ended up like this: when he saw Lina again, he would scold Fernando and Rino a bit, sometimes saying harsh things, which made her feel bad and she would defend them.\n[1964-09-30 16:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I knew he would shake his head in frustration, beginning to feel that too much money was being spent on shoes, with no return yet in sight.\n[1964-09-30 16:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I knew that when summer was about to end, the conflict between him and Lina's father escalated. He set a deadline for Lina, her father, and a few apprentices, saying that by November he wanted to see the initial results, at least the winter shoe designs, both men's and women's, displayed in the window before Christmas.\n[1964-09-30 16:00:40] Lina's house | I know that in the end, he was also very frustrated, and he couldn't help but say to Lina that Rino only wanted money and never thought about working. Lina defended her brother, but Stefano refuted her, and finally Lina lost her temper. Then Stefano immediately gave in.\n[1964-09-30 20:00:00] The rooftop of the old house | I saw him take out the first pair of shoes he had made, the ones he had never worn after buying them. They were a very precious token in their love story.\n[1964-09-30 20:00:10] The rooftop of the old house | I saw him touching the shoes and sniffing them with his nose. I heard her say, deeply moved, that through these shoes he could feel and see the image of Lina's little hands working together with her brother.\n[1964-09-30 20:00:20] The rooftop of the old house | I saw them then, standing on the rooftop of the old house. I know it's the place where they had the fireworks competition with the Solara brothers.\n[1964-09-30 20:00:30] The rooftop of the old house | I saw him take her hand, pressing each finger one by one in a tender way. I heard him say that he would never again allow these hands to do hard work.\n[1964-10-01 10:00:00] New House | When I told her about Stefano's act of love, Lina was happy. These were the things she said to me when she took me to visit their new home.\n[1964-10-01 10:00:10] New House | I saw the house and it was really great: the tile floor gleamed, the bathtub was perfect for bubble baths, the dining room and bedroom were furnished with carved wooden furniture, and there was even a refrigerator and a telephone.\n[1964-10-01 10:00:20] New House | I was so excited that I wrote down her phone number. I thought about how we were both born and grew up in small houses, without our own rooms, not even a place to study. I still live in the small house where I was born, but she does not.\n[1964-10-01 10:00:30] New Room Balcony | I saw that we had arrived at the balcony. I saw the balcony facing the railway and Mount Vesuvius.\n[1964-10-01 10:00:40] New Room Balcony | I heard myself asking her carefully, \"Will you come here alone with Stefano?\"\n[1964-10-01 10:00:50] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"Sometimes it does.\"\n[1964-10-01 10:01:00] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"What's going to happen?\"\n[1964-10-01 10:01:10] New Room Balcony | I saw her looking at me as if she didn't understand a word I said. I heard, \"What do you mean by that?\"\n[1964-10-01 10:01:20] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"Did you [intimate things]?\" I thought I felt a bit embarrassed.\n[1964-10-01 10:01:30] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"Sometimes it does.\"\n[1964-10-01 10:01:40] New Room Balcony | \"I heard 'And then?'\"\n[1964-10-01 10:01:50] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"There's no 'then,' we're not even married yet.\"\n[1964-10-01 10:02:00] New Room Balcony | I thought I was getting confused: they had so much freedom, but nothing really happened—how was that possible? There were so many rumors about her in the neighborhood, and the Solara brothers had even revealed some indecent details, yet they just went on with [intimate acts]?\n[1964-10-01 10:02:10] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"He doesn't ask you?\"\n[1964-10-01 10:02:20] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"Why, did Antonio ask you to?\"\n[1964-10-01 10:02:30] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1964-10-01 10:02:40] New Room Balcony | I heard, \"He doesn't ask me. We agreed, first we have to get married.\"\n[1964-10-01 10:02:50] New Room Balcony | I thought my question had surprised her, just as her answer had surprised me. So she didn't give anything to Stefano, even though they went out alone in the car, even though they were about to get married and already had a fully renovated house, the mattress on their bed was still unopened.\n[1964-10-01 10:03:00] New Room Balcony | I thought about it, but the subject of marriage had never even been mentioned, and my experience had long since gone beyond just [intimate acts].\n[1964-10-01 10:03:10] New Room Balcony | I saw her ask me—purely out of curiosity—whether I had given Antonio what he wanted. I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth, so I said there wasn't any.\n[1964-10-01 10:03:20] New Room Balcony | I saw that she looked happy about the answer.",

    "text": "[1964-10-05 10:00:00] By the pond | I knew our dates by the pond became less frequent because school was coming up.\n[1964-10-05 10:00:10] Posillipo | I thought about my classes and homework, and I was sure Lina would exclude me from the wedding preparations, as she had gotten used to me disappearing for a while after school started.\n[1964-10-05 10:00:20] Capodimonte | I know, but this time is different—Lina's relationship with Pinocchio has become more tense, not just about clothes, hats, scarves, or jewelry anymore.\n[1964-10-08 10:00:00] Capodimonte | I once saw Pinocchio clearly tell Lina's brother in front of Lina. I heard that his future wife will work in Capodimonte, either starting immediately or after the honeymoon. She should work like everyone else, just like Alfonso Carracci, who always helped out in the store whenever school was out.\n[1964-10-08 10:00:10] Capodimonte | I heard that if his fiancée doesn't work, then she won't work either. I knew that Pinocchio's mother was openly supporting her daughter this time.\n[1964-10-08 10:00:20] Capodimonte | I saw Lina not blink at all; she could start working right away, whatever the Caracci family wanted her to do, she could begin the next day.\n[1964-10-08 10:00:30] Capodimonte | I thought of this answer as the way Lina used to speak, and even though she tried to use a calm and gentle tone, it still revealed an unyielding arrogance and a sneer at those who provoked her, which only further angered Pinocchia.\n[1964-10-08 10:00:40] Capodimonte | I thought it was obvious that, in the eyes of the mother and daughter, the cobbler's daughter was a witch, come to take over their home. She wouldn't lift a finger to earn money, but she spent it like water. She had the men in the family completely under her spell, making them act unjustly toward their own blood relatives—his own sister, even his mother.\n[1964-10-08 10:00:50] Capodimonte | I saw that Stefano still had the same attitude as before, not answering immediately but waiting for his sister to finish venting her anger. I thought that, in the end, the issue of Lina and her role in this small family business had never really come up.\n[1964-10-08 10:01:00] Capodimonte | I heard him say calmly that it was better for Pinocchio to be working at Capodimonte than to help his fiancée prepare for the wedding.\n[1964-10-08 10:01:10] Capodimonte | \"I no longer have a place here?\" my sister asked immediately.\n[1964-10-08 10:01:20] Capodimonte | I heard, \"No need. From tomorrow on, I'll have Melina's daughter Pinocchia take over your job.\"\n[1964-10-08 10:01:30] Capodimonte | \"I guess she suggested it, didn't she?\" Pinochia shouted, pointing at Lina.\n[1964-10-08 10:01:40] Capodimonte | I heard, \"That's none of your business.\"\n[1964-10-08 10:01:50] Capodimonte | \"I heard it, Mom, did you hear what he said? He thinks he's the master here, the only master!\"\n[1964-10-08 10:02:00] Capodimonte | I saw Maria finally stand up from the stool behind the counter and say to her son. I heard, \"You're also going to find someone to take my place, I'm tired and don't want to work hard anymore.\" I saw that what followed was an unbearable silence.\n[1964-10-08 10:02:10] Capodimonte | At that moment, Stefano made a concession, he said slowly. I heard, \"Let's be quiet. I'm not the owner. Actually, this Capodimonte isn't just my own affair—it involves all of us. We need to make a decision.\"\n[1964-10-08 10:02:20] Capodimonte | \"I heard, 'Pinocchio, do you need work? No. Mom, do you need to sit behind the counter every day? No.'\"\n[1964-10-08 10:02:30] Capodimonte | I heard, \"Then let those who need to work do it. I'll have Pinocchia at the counter, and at the cash register, I'll think about it. Otherwise, who's going to handle the wedding arrangements?\"\n[1964-10-08 16:00:00] Posillipo | I wasn't entirely sure, nor was I clear about whether Lina had anything to do with pushing Pinocchia and her mother out of the daily work at Capodimonte, and whether she had been involved in hiring Pinocchia.\n[1964-10-08 16:00:10] Posillipo | I thought to myself that I could be certain that Lina's sister-in-law and mother-in-law now had plenty of time to devote to her wedding, which was certainly not a pleasant thing for her.\n[1964-10-08 16:00:20] Posillipo | I knew these two women made her life more complicated, every small detail leading to conflicts: the guests invited, the church renovation, the photographer, the band, the reception restaurant, the menu, the cake, the wedding candies, the rings, even the honeymoon trip.\n[1964-10-08 16:00:30] Posillipo | I know that Pinocchio and Maria think it's too close to Sorrento, Positano, Ischia, and Vomero.\n[1964-10-08 16:00:40] Posillipo | I thought that was all, but suddenly I found myself pulled into this complicated relationship. On the surface, I was giving Lina some advice, but in reality, I was helping her fight a difficult battle.\n[1964-10-10 10:00:00] School | I knew that I had just started school and there were many difficult new courses to learn. I adopted the usual method of burying myself in study, which exhausted me. I had always stubbornly persisted.\n[1964-10-10 16:00:00] Street | I heard that, but when I got back from school, my friend would always ask me for something really embarrassing: \"Please, Rino, can you be my advisor tomorrow?\"\n[1964-10-10 16:00:10] Street | I thought I didn't even know what she was talking about. During chemistry class, I was called on by the teacher and didn't answer well—I was feeling upset inside.\n[1964-10-10 16:00:20] Street | I heard, \"What kind of advisor?\"\n[1964-10-10 16:00:30] Street | \"I heard, 'Pick a wedding dress. Please don't refuse me, because if you don't come, I might kill my sister-in-law and mother-in-law.'\"\n[1964-10-11 16:00:00] Wedding Dress Store | I saw I was the last one to go. I stood on Lina's side, which made Pinocchia and Maria uncomfortable.\n[1964-10-11 16:00:10] Wedding Dress Store | I saw the bridal shop in the Rettifilo district. I remember I put a few books in my bag, hoping to have a chance to look at them, but it was never possible.\n[1964-10-11 16:00:20] Wedding Dress Store | From four in the afternoon until seven in the evening, we looked at many patterns, touched the fabrics, and Lina tried on the wedding dress that was displayed on the mannequin in the window.\n[1964-10-11 16:00:30] Wedding Dress Shop | I thought of those clothes that enhanced her beauty. She looked beautiful in sheer, stiff muslin, or in soft satin, or even in a gauzy silk wedding dress.\n[1964-10-11 16:00:40] Wedding Dress Shop | I thought about how the dress was made of lace, with ruffled sleeves, and it fit her perfectly; whether it was a wide skirt or a narrow one, it looked good on her.\n[1964-10-11 16:00:50] Wedding Dress Shop | I thought that whether it was a long or short train, she would look good in either; the wavy veil, as well as that simple veil, would also look beautiful on her head; the crown on her head, whether adorned with pearls, orange blossoms, or colored glass, would look equally nice on her.\n[1964-10-11 16:01:00] Wedding Dress Store | I saw that she was also obedient; she carefully looked at the patterns and tried on the beautiful wedding dresses that were on the mannequins.\n[1964-10-11 16:01:10] Wedding Dress Shop | I thought that sometimes, she simply couldn't stand the overly critical attitude of the two future in-laws.\n[1964-10-11 16:01:20] Wedding Dress Shop | I remember once when Lina started to resist. She stared into my eyes and said in a mocking tone. I heard, \"Let's try the green satin, or the red stiff lace, or maybe this beautiful black net dress, or yellow?\"\n[1964-10-11 16:01:30] Wedding Dress Shop | I saw that this made her sister-in-law and mother-in-law extremely frightened. I smiled and wanted to tell them that the bride was just joking.\n[1964-10-11 16:01:40] Wedding Dress Shop | I saw them start to look resentful again, carefully examining the fabric and style of the wedding dress.",

Lina always leaned toward one style, one fabric, and Pinocchia and Maria would join forces to suggest another style, another fabric instead.\n[1964-10-11 17:00:10] Wedding Dress Store | I saw that I had been silent all along. I thought it was partly because their conversation had confused me; on the other hand, the smell of the new fabric also made me feel dizzy.\n[1964-10-11 17:00:20] Wedding Dress Shop | I saw it all, and Lina frowned and asked me. \"I heard 'What do you think? Rino.'\"\n[1964-10-11 17:00:30] Wedding Dress Shop | I saw that everyone fell silent. I thought I would immediately feel astonished, but instead, I sensed that the two women were waiting for this moment, the very moment they feared.\n[1964-10-11 17:00:40] Wedding Dress Store | I thought about how I had applied the rhetorical skills I learned at school here, and the method was this: whenever you don't know how to answer a question, you should give a long-winded introduction, analyzing the issue with a very confident tone, as if you already knew the conclusion.\n[1964-10-11 17:00:50] Wedding Dress Store | I started speaking in Mandarin—I really liked the styles that Pinocchia and her mother had chosen. I didn't directly compliment how beautiful the styles were, but instead analyzed how perfectly they suited Lina's figure.\n[1964-10-11 17:01:00] Wedding Dress Shop | I thought that as I spoke, it was like addressing a teacher in class, and I felt the mother and daughter beginning to like and approve of me.\n[1964-10-11 17:01:10] Wedding Dress Shop | I picked a style at random, really just grabbing any one, but I made sure not to take the one Lina had her eye on.\n[1964-10-11 17:01:20] Wedding Dress Shop | I saw and then I simply showed them that the style I was holding had the advantages of the ones chosen by the mother and daughter, as well as the advantages of the style that my friend Lina had liked.\n[1964-10-11 17:01:30] Wedding Dress Shop | I saw that at this moment, the tailor and the mother and daughter also agreed with my opinion. Lina just squinted at me for a moment, then returned to her previous expression, saying she agreed with my view as well.\n[1964-10-11 19:30:00] Rettifilo District Street | I saw Pinocchia and Maria coming out of the bridal shop, both in high spirits. I thought about how their words almost carried affection for Lina.\n[1964-10-11 19:30:10] Rettifilo District Street | I saw them commenting on the wedding dresses they had bought, constantly mentioning the words I had said. I heard, for example: like Elena said, or: Elena said the same thing.\n[1964-10-11 19:30:20] Rettifilo District Street | I saw Lina hesitate, then fall behind them. In the crowd of people out in the Rettifilo district at night, she asked me. I heard, \"You learned it at school, didn't you?\"\n[1964-10-11 19:30:30] Rettifilo District Street | \"I heard 'What?'\"\n[1964-10-11 19:30:40] Rettifilo District Street | I heard \"to tease someone with words.\"\n[1964-10-11 19:30:50] Rettifilo District Street | I felt very sad, so I said in a low voice. I heard, \"Don't you like the style we chose?\"\n[1964-10-11 19:31:00] Rettifilo District Street | I heard, \"I really like it.\"\n[1964-10-11 19:31:10] Rettifilo District Street | \"I heard 'Then what?'\"\n[1964-10-11 19:31:20] Rettifilo District Street | I heard, \"You have to do me a favor. Every time I call you, you have to go out with us.\"\n[1964-10-11 19:31:30] Rettifilo District Street | I saw it and got very angry, so I said. I heard, \"Do you want to use me to trick someone?\"\n[1964-10-11 19:31:40] Rettifilo District Street | I saw that she understood I was angry, and she tightly grasped my hand. I heard myself say, \"I shouldn't have said that just now. I just meant to say that you're really good at being likable, which is the difference between us. People are scared of me, but not of you.\"\n[1964-10-11 19:31:50] Rettifilo District Street | I saw and became even more angry. I heard, \"Maybe it's because you're bad.\"\n[1964-10-11 19:32:00] Rettifilo District Street | I saw her answer. I heard, \"It's possible.\" I thought about how I felt I had hurt her, just as she had hurt me.\n[1964-10-11 19:32:10] Rettifilo District Street | I saw it and immediately regretted it, saying a salvaging words. I heard, \"Antonio was willing to give his life for you; he said thanks for helping his sister get a job.\"\n[1964-10-11 19:32:20] Rettifilo District Street | I saw her answer. I heard, \"It was Stefano who arranged the job for Pinocchia. I'm a bad man.\"\n[1964-11-15 10:00:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina's father sending Stefano to the store to look at the shoes in November, never even considering letting Lina see them first, even though Lina was still living at home at the time.\n[1964-11-15 10:00:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano deliberately took his fiancée and his sister Pinocchia to see it. I saw the three of them dressed as if they had just stepped out of a television screen.\n[1964-11-15 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina say to me that she had tried on the shoes, and seeing the shoes she had designed years ago made into real objects filled her with intense excitement. I thought it was as if a fairy had really made her dream come true, and those shoes were exactly as she had imagined them before.\n[1964-11-15 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Pinocchia also stunned; she tried on a pair of shoes she liked and praised Rino endlessly. I wanted him to feel like a true master craftsman, capable of making such light, strong, beautifully shaped shoes.\n[1964-11-15 10:00:40] Shoe Repair Shop | The only person who seemed unhappy was Stefano.\n[1964-11-15 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him cut short Lina's enthusiastic flattery toward her brother, father, and several apprentices. He told Pinocchia to be quiet—Pinocchia was sweetly flattering Rino, lifting the ankle of one foot to show how perfectly the shoe fit.\n[1964-11-15 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Stefano start to criticize, one by one, the discrepancies between the shoes and the drawings.\n[1964-11-15 10:01:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him especially focusing on the men's shoes, saying that the pair Rino and Lina had secretly made for Fernando back then was different from the ones the father and son later made. I heard him ask, \"What's going on with this edge? Where are these stitches? And what's this golden button doing here?\" He asked rudely.\n[1964-11-15 10:01:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that even though Fernando had logically explained the reasons for the changes, saying they were to cover up problems in the design, Stefano still refused to back down. He said he had invested so much money and it wasn't for just any pair of shoes—he wanted a design exactly like the one Lina had created.\n[1964-11-15 10:01:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Lina's attitude was gentle, and she immediately took her father's side. I saw the atmosphere was very tense.\n[1964-11-15 10:01:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw her say to her fiancé that they should forget about the previous drawings, that her design was just a girl's fanciful idea, and that those changes weren't very noticeable but were absolutely necessary.\n[1964-11-15 10:01:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw Rino standing on Stefano's side, so they kept arguing until Fernando finally gave up.\n[1964-11-15 10:02:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw him sitting in a corner, looking at the blueprint on the wall. I heard, \"If you need these shoes before Christmas, that's the way it is. If you want shoes exactly like those designed by my daughter, go find someone else to make them.\"\n[1964-11-15 10:02:10] Shoe Repair Shop | At that moment, Stefano gave in, and Rino took a step back.",

The moment I saw those shoes, I felt a sense of wealth and luxury.\n[1964-12-25 10:00:20] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought about those shoes and the shabby display window of the shop, the bleak scenery outside, and the incongruous interior of the store.\n[1964-12-25 10:00:30] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw the shoe repair shop, where leather scraps, worktables, awls, and lasts were scattered everywhere. The boxes of shoes piled up to the ceiling, waiting for customers to come and buy them.\n[1964-12-25 10:00:40] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought that even though Fernando had modified the shoes, it was just our naive dream, not taking into account the reality of this Mergellina.\n[1964-12-25 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I knew that, in reality, not a single pair of shoes had been sold until Christmas.\n[1964-12-25 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that only Antonio was in the shop, and he asked Rino for a pair of size forty-four shoes, which he tried on.\n[1964-12-25 20:00:00] Posillipo | I later found out what it was like to wear those shoes: they fit perfectly. He imagined himself appearing at the wedding with me, wearing a new suit and those shoes. But in the end, he didn't buy them.\n[1964-12-25 20:00:10] Posillipo | I saw when he asked about the price of the shoes, Rino told him the price.\n[1964-12-25 20:00:20] Posillipo | I heard him respond in astonishment: \"Are you crazy?\"\n[1964-12-25 20:00:30] Posillipo | I heard Rino say to him, \"You can pay it monthly.\"\n[1964-12-25 20:00:40] Posillipo | I saw him smiling as he answered. I heard, \"Then I might as well go buy a Lancia scooter.\"\n[1964-12-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I found out about Lina's suffering when I saw the Christmas play, which I learned about from Pinocchio.\n[1964-12-25T10:05:00] Mergellina | I heard her say, \"She almost lost her life.\" I know that the doctor later cut her open, otherwise the child couldn't have been born.\n[1964-12-25T10:10:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"Did she have a boy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is the child okay?\" \"Very beautiful.\" \"What about her?\" \"She's gained weight.\"\n[1964-12-25T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw and also learned that Stefano wanted to name the child after his father Achille, but Lina immediately objected. They argued fiercely. I knew they hadn't fought for a long time, but this time their argument was completely out of control, and everyone in the hospital heard it. Later, the nurses had to come and stop them.\n[1964-12-25T10:20:00] Mergellina | I know that in the end, they named the child Rino, just like Lina's brother.\n[1964-12-25T10:25:00] Mergellina | I realized I had been listening to her all along without interrupting. I felt uneasy, and in order to face my discomfort, I adopted an attitude of detached observation; Pinocchio noticed this.\n[1964-12-25T10:30:00] Mergellina | I heard her say, \"I've been talking, talking all the time, but you don't say a word. You make me feel like a news anchor. Don't you care about us at all anymore?\" \"Of course I do.\"\n[1964-12-25T10:31:00] The Old Library | \"I heard, 'You're so beautiful now, even your voice has changed.' 'Was my old voice so bad?' 'Your old voice was just like ours.' 'What about now?' 'Now it's softer.'\"\n[1965-01-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I stayed at our Mergellina for ten days, from December 24, 1964, to January 3, 1965, but I never went to see Lina. I thought about how I didn't want to see her son, and I was worried that I might see Nino's shadow in the shape of his mouth and nose, or in the shape of his eyes and ears.\n[1965-01-01T12:00:00] My home | I know that in my family, everyone clearly regarded me as an important person, someone who would just stop by for a brief greeting and then quickly leave. I thought of my father, who would be satisfied looking at me. I could feel his satisfaction, and if I had spoken to him, he would have been embarrassed. He never asked what I was studying, what use it would be, or what kind of job I would get afterward—not because he didn't want to know, but because he was afraid he wouldn't understand my answer.\n[1965-01-01T12:05:00] My home | I saw my mother always pacing around the house angrily, and I heard her distinctive footsteps. I thought about how terrified I had been back then, afraid of becoming like her; but luckily, I am now far away from her, completely different from her, and she senses my thoughts.\n[1965-01-01T12:10:00] My home | Even now, when she speaks to me, at any moment, I can feel the dissatisfaction in her voice. I know that things are different from the past, because now she no longer lets me wash the dishes, clear the table, or mop the floor. I thought that all those terrible things that happened were my fault.\n[1965-01-01T13:00:00] My home | I felt a bit embarrassed being with my brother and sister. They struggled to speak Italian to me, and they often corrected their own mistakes, which made them feel self-conscious. I thought about it, but I tried to act as I always had when I was with them, and they gradually got used to it.\n[1965-01-01T20:00:00] Mergellina | I know that in the evenings, I don't know how to spend my time anymore; those old friends of ours no longer hang out together. Pasquale now has a terrible relationship with Antonio and is doing everything he can to avoid him.\n[1965-01-01T20:05:00] Mergellina | I didn't want to see anyone, partly because he didn't have time; the Solara brothers always sent him out to do this and that. I know it's also because he didn't know what to say; he couldn't talk about his work, and he didn't have a private life either.\n[1965-01-01T20:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Pinocchio finish her work at Capodimonte, and then either take care of her mother and younger brothers and sisters, or be too tired and in a bad mood, going to [intimate act] bed early. I knew she wasn't seeing Pasquale much anymore, which worried him a lot.\n[1965-01-01T20:15:00] Mergellina | I thought about Pinocchia, who now hated everyone and everything, maybe even me. She hated her job in the new Capodimonte, hated the people in the Calafiore family, hated Enzo for abandoning her, and was always fighting with her brother.\n[1965-01-01T20:20:00] Mergellina | I saw it, yes, it was Enzo, finally it was Enzo. Now his mother Assunta is very ill. Enzo not only risks his life earning money to survive, but also has to take care of his mother. He's busy all night — Enzo never shows up anymore. I know it's surprising, but he finally obtained a certificate in industrial management. He earned it through self-study, struggling hard to get it, which made me very curious. I thought to myself, who could have imagined it.\n[1965-01-03T10:00:00] Mergellina | I managed to contact him before returning to Borgo, and we took a walk together, chatting for a while.\n[1965-01-03T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw myself enthusiastically congratulating him on his achievement, and he made a face indicating it wasn't a big deal.\n[1965-01-03T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that he was talking less and less, until finally I was the only one speaking, and he said nothing at all.\n[1965-01-03T10:15:00] The Old Library | I remember that we never mentioned Lina, not a single word, yet it seemed as if he had been talking about Lina all along. Before we parted, he suddenly said. I heard, \"No matter what, Lina is the best mother in the entire Mergellina.\"\n[1965-01-03T10:20:00] Mergellina | The words made my mood instantly worse. I'd never thought of Enzo as a particularly sensitive person, but in that situation, as he walked beside me, it was as if he had heard—just as if I had spoken it out loud—the silent condemnation I had for our friend Lina. It was as though, without my realizing it, my body had already taken that stance.",

    "text": "[1965-01-10 10:00:00] Lina's house | I thought back to that time, when Lina was completely focused on preparing for the wedding and didn't notice her brother's change.\n[1965-01-10 10:00:10] Lina's house | I thought about Rino before, who was always cheerful, even though the work was very hard. He also liked to joke around. But now he has become gloomy, can't sleep well, and gets angry easily.\n[1965-01-10 10:00:20] Lina's house | I saw that sometimes Rino got angry, and Lina, in defense of her brother, would say to Pinocchio. I heard, \"He's so moody, he throws a tantrum if things don't go his way. He has no patience, really like a child!\"\n[1965-01-10 10:00:30] Lina's house | I thought about Lina and Fernando, who didn't feel that not selling a single pair of shoes on Christmas was a failure.\n[1965-01-10 10:00:40] Lina's house | In the end, making these shoes wasn't based on a very specific and feasible plan. Everything came from Stefano's sudden whim to see Lina's fantasy turned into a tangible reality.\n[1965-01-10 10:00:50] Shoe Repair Shop | I know they have single shoes, as well as felt shoes, and shoes for all seasons, which is a good thing.\n[1965-01-10 10:01:00] Shoe Repair Shop | I saw that in Lina's shop, white boxes were piling up, containing shoes of all styles.\n[1965-01-10 10:01:10] Shoe Repair Shop | I thought that as long as I waited for winter, spring, and autumn, those shoes would sell.\n[1965-01-15 10:00:00] Shoe Store | I saw that Rino was becoming more and more uneasy. After Christmas, Rino took matters into his own hands; he ran to a dusty shoe shop at the end of the main road.\n[1965-01-15 10:00:10] Shoe Store | I saw Rino tell the boss that he wanted to display a few pairs of \"Lina\" shoes in the window, no need to pay in advance, just to see if anyone would buy them. I know that, even though he knew, the owner of the shoe shop was as close to the Solara brothers as brothers themselves.\n[1965-01-15 10:00:20] Shoe Store | I saw the boss politely refuse him, saying those shoes weren't suitable for his customer base.\n[1965-01-15 10:00:30] Shoe Store | I saw him get angry right away, and the two of us started exchanging insults, so everyone in Mergellina found out.\n[1965-01-15 10:00:40] Lina's house | I saw Fernando yelling at his son, and Rino retorted.\n[1965-01-15 10:00:50] Lina's house | I thought of Lina again, and I felt how my brother was annoying, showing a destructive power that frightened her.\n[1965-01-20 16:00:00] Street | When I saw the four of them go out together, she noticed that her brother deliberately had her and Pinocchia walk ahead, while he and Stefano walked behind to talk.\n[1965-01-20 16:00:10] Street | I saw that, in general, Capodimonte's boss would patiently listen to him. Once, Lina heard her fiancé say. \"I heard, 'I'm sorry, Rino. Do you think, I've invested so much money in the workshop, that shop is like a bottomless pit, just out of love for your sister?'\"\n[1965-01-20 16:00:20] Street | I heard, \"We've already made the shoes, and they're very beautiful. Now we need to sell them, but the problem is finding the right market.\"\n[1965-01-20 16:00:30] Street | I saw the line \"just out of love for your sister\" made her unhappy, but she ignored it.\n[1965-01-20 16:00:40] Street | I saw that the words had a good effect on Rino, and he calmed down, beginning to play the role of a sales expert, especially in front of Pinocchia.\n[1965-01-20 16:00:50] Street | I heard him say that one needs to have a broader vision. Why do so many great initiatives end up failing? Why did Glaci's auto repair shop give up making lightweight motorcycles? Why did the seamstress's new store only last six months? Because none of these businesses had any real creativity.\n[1965-01-20 16:01:00] Street | I heard that \"Lina\" would soon leave this rotten neighborhood and achieve success in the wealthy district.\n[1965-02-01 10:00:00] Wedding Dress Shop | I could see the wedding day getting closer and closer. Lina went to the bridal shop to try on her dress, and then she decorated the future home.\n[1965-02-01 10:00:10] Lina's house | I saw her struggling with Pinocchia and Maria; the mother and daughter could not stand Nunzia interfering with the wedding preparations.\n[1965-02-01 10:00:20] Lina's house | I knew that as March 12th approached, the relationship between them grew increasingly tense, but it wasn't these conflicts that caused the rift. At that time, two consecutive events deeply hurt Lina.\n[1965-02-15 16:00:00] Street | I remember a cold afternoon in February when Lina suddenly asked me if I could accompany her to Professor Oliviero's house.\n[1965-02-15 16:00:10] Street | I thought about how she had never shown the least bit of interest or affection for Professor Oliviero, nor had she ever felt any gratitude. Now, she felt it necessary to personally deliver the wedding invitation to him.\n[1965-02-15 16:00:20] Street | I thought about the past, and I had never told her about the contemptuous tone the teacher used when mentioning her. At that time, I also hadn't been able to bring it up with her.\n[1965-02-15 16:00:30] Street | I thought that during that period, Teacher Oliviero didn't seem so harsh anymore; she had become somewhat sad, and perhaps she would gladly accept Lina's invitation.\n[1965-02-15 16:10:00] The teacher's house downstairs | I saw Lina that day dressed very elegantly. We walked together to the building where the teacher lived, just a few steps away from the church.\n[1965-02-15 16:10:10] The teacher's house staircase | I noticed that she was very uneasy as we went upstairs. I thought I had grown accustomed to that path, those stairs, but she hadn't. She didn't say a word.\n[1965-02-15 16:10:20] At the teacher's doorstep | I saw myself pressing the doorbell, then heard Teacher Oliviero's sluggish footsteps.\n[1965-02-15 16:10:30] At the teacher's home door | I heard, \"Who is it?\"\n[1965-02-15 16:10:40] At the teacher's front door | I heard \"Grego.\"\n[1965-02-15 16:10:50] At the teacher's front door | I saw her open the door. I saw a purple shawl on her shoulders, her face partially covered by a scarf.\n[1965-02-15 16:11:00] At the teacher's doorstep | I saw Lina smile immediately. I heard, \"Teacher, do you remember me?\"\n[1965-02-15 16:11:10] At the teacher's front door | I saw Professor Oliviero staring at her. I thought of the look she gave when Lina used to annoy her in elementary school.\n[1965-02-15 16:11:20] At the teacher's doorstep | I saw it all, and Professor Oliviero looked at me, as if she had something in her mouth, and she spoke with great difficulty. I heard, \"Who is she? I don't know her.\"\n[1965-02-15 16:11:30] At the teacher's front door | I saw Lina was a bit flustered, and she immediately spoke in Italian. I heard, \"I'm Lina. I'm here to deliver the invitation. I'm getting married. If you can come to my wedding, I'll be very honored.\"\n[1965-02-15 16:11:40] At the teacher's doorstep | I saw the teacher speaking to me. I knew \"Lina,\" but I didn't know who this woman was.\n[1965-02-15 16:11:50] At the teacher's front door | I saw her close the door in front of us.\n[1965-02-15 16:12:00] The teacher's house staircase | I saw us staying a while on the staircase landing, holding her hand, trying to comfort her.\n[1965-02-15 16:12:10] The teacher's house staircase | I saw her pull her hand back and slip the invitation under the door. We went downstairs.\n[1965-02-15 16:20:00] Street | I saw that all along the way, she was complaining about how complicated the city hall and church procedures were. I heard that my father helped her a lot.\n[1965-03-01 10:00:00] Lina's house | I know another thing that made Lina sad, perhaps even more painful for her, which was about Stefano and the shoes.\n[1965-03-01 10:00:10] Lina's house | I knew from the beginning that they had decided the officiant would be a relative of Maria's, who had moved to Mergellina after the war and now ran her own small business, dealing in antiques from various places, especially metal objects.\n[1965-03-01 10:00:20] Lina's House | I know he married a woman from Mergellina, and his accent has changed, because of the way he speaks, he holds a certain amount of authority at home, he's also Stefano's confirmation godfather.\n[1965-03-01 10:00:30] Lina's House | I knew everything had already been decided, but Stefano suddenly changed his mind.\n[1965-03-01 10:00:40] Lina's House | When I saw Lina talking about this matter, at first it seemed just like the other annoying things that had been happening recently. To her, it didn't matter who the witness was; she wasn't concerned about that. The most important thing was making a decision.",

    "text": "[1965-03-01 10:00:50] Lina's house | I saw that for several days, Stefano was evasive and spoke incoherently, and she still didn't know who had replaced the couple from Mergellina.\n[1965-03-01T10:00:00] New Mergellina | I saw that out of love for little Rino, Lina started going out; she dressed the child in a sky-blue or white outfit. I saw her laying the child in the stroller, which her brother had bought with a lot of money, and she was walking alone in the new Mergellina.\n[1965-03-01T10:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw that as soon as the child cried a little, she would immediately go into Capodimonte, breastfeeding the child in the loving gaze of my mother-in-law and the flattering comments of the customers. At that moment, Pinocchio would lower his head and work silently, saying not a word.\n[1965-03-01T10:15:00] Capodimonte | When I saw the child whimper, she immediately offered him the breast. She loved feeding the child, loved that feeling—the milk flowing from her body, nourishing the child and making her chest grow smaller and smaller. I thought this was the only moment she found happy, written in her notebook, and she feared the day her child would wean.\n[1965-03-05 10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw it all, and a week before the wedding, she discovered the truth.\n[1965-03-05 10:00:10] Lina's house | I saw Stefano inform her that the matter was settled and unchangeable. He didn't explain the reason, only telling her that the officiant would be Silvio Solara—the father of Marcello and Michele.\n[1965-03-05 10:00:20] Lina's House | I thought that before this, Lina had never imagined that Marcello would come to the wedding as their distant relative.\n[1965-03-05 10:00:30] Lina's house | I thought of the few days when she had turned back into the little girl I was familiar with.\n[1965-03-05 10:00:40] Lina's house | I saw her curse at Stefano, using very vulgar language. I heard her say she never wanted to see him again.\n[1965-03-05 10:00:50] Lina's house | I saw her locking herself in her parents' house, no longer caring about anything, not even going to the final dress fitting, not doing anything related to the impending wedding.\n[1965-03-06 10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw everyone taking turns trying to persuade her. First, her mother—Nunzia was very sad, saying she had to think about the family.\n[1965-03-06 10:10:00] Lina's House | I saw then Fernando, who spoke somewhat awkwardly. I realized she could no longer be the clueless little girl she once was: anyone wanting to establish themselves in Mergellina had to have Silvio Solara as their godfather.\n[1965-03-06 10:20:00] Lina's house | I saw it was Rino, and he spoke to her very roughly. I heard that she married a businessman, and businessmen are only interested in money. The Solara family is like a bank, especially as a channel connecting the \"Lina\" shoes and the shoe store.\n[1965-03-06 10:20:10] Lina's house | I saw bloodshot eyes in him as he shouted at his younger sister. \"I heard, 'What do you want to do? Are you going to destroy me, my whole family, and all the hard work we've done so far?'\"\n[1965-03-06 10:30:00] Lina's house | After seeing it, even Pinocchio came, and she spoke in a phony tone. I heard that when she gets married in the future, she would be happy for Mergellina's antique dealer to serve as the officiant, but I need to think carefully, not let something so small ruin the wedding and destroy a love.\n[1965-03-07 10:00:00] Lina's house | I watched as a day and night passed, with Nunzia remaining motionless in the corner, neither doing housework nor going to sleep.\n[1965-03-07 10:30:00] Posillipo | I saw her sneak out of the house at last to find me, asking me to talk to her daughter and say a few kind words. I thought I felt proud.\n[1965-03-07 10:30:10] Posillipo | I thought about it for a long time, weighing which side to take. It was about a wedding, a very practical matter, yet very complicated, involving many emotions and interests.\n[1965-03-07 10:30:20] Posillipo | I thought about how scared I was. Even though I could publicly criticize the \"Holy Spirit\" and challenge the authority of the religious teacher, if I had been in Lina's position, I definitely wouldn't have had the courage to let everything fall apart.\n[1965-03-07 10:30:30] Posillipo | I thought about it, but she could do it, she had the courage to do so, even though the wedding was about to take place.\n[1965-03-07 10:30:40] Posillipo | What should I do? I felt that just a little bit of strength would be enough to push her onto that path.\n[1965-03-07 10:30:50] Posillipo | I thought the outcome would satisfy me: making Lina return to being that pale girl again, with a ponytail, eyes squinting like a bird of prey, dressed in cheap clothes, so she would never again have that kind of presence, like Jacqueline Kennedy, appearing at Mergellina.\n[1965-03-07 10:31:00] Posillipo | I thought about it, but whether for me or for her, I felt it was improper. I believed it was for her own good, and I didn't want her to go back to that dim house at Lina's again.\n[1965-03-07 11:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that, so I made up my mind. I persuaded her again and again, carefully and cautiously. \"I heard, 'Lina, Silvio Solara isn't Marcello, nor Michele. You're acting like this now, and you know better than me.'\"\n[1965-03-07 11:00:10] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'You know, it wasn't Silvio Solara who pulled Pinochietta into the car, and it wasn't him who shot at us on New Year's night, nor was it him staying in your house all the time, nor was it him speaking ill of you.'\"\n[1965-03-07 11:00:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"Silvio will be the best man, he'll help Rino and Stefano sell those shoes. It's simple, and it won't affect your future life at all.\"\n[1965-03-07 11:00:30] Lina's House | I told her everything we knew, starting with the events of the previous generation, then moving on to our own, explaining how different we were, especially emphasizing how different she was from Stefano.\n[1965-03-07 11:00:40] Lina's House | I saw that the last part of my words caught her attention, softening her attitude a bit, so I spoke with even more enthusiasm.\n[1965-03-07 11:00:50] Lina's house | I saw her quietly listening to me, clearly she wanted me to help her calm down, and she gradually became calm.\n[1965-03-07 11:01:00] Lina's house | I saw it in her eyes that Stefano's behavior revealed another side of him, a side she couldn't recognize, and she found it more terrifying than Rino's madness.\n[1965-03-07 11:01:10] Lina's house | I heard her say, \"Maybe, he didn't really love me.\"\n[1965-03-07 11:01:20] Lina's House | I heard, \"What, he doesn't love you? What did you say, he does whatever you say?\"\n[1965-03-07 11:01:30] Lina's House | I saw her speak about Stefano Carraci in a very contemptuous manner, something that had never happened before. I heard, \"That didn't threaten his real interests.\"\n[1965-03-08 10:00:00] Lina's house | I watched until she finally went out again. She didn't go to Capodimonte, nor to the new house. In any case, she wasn't the one who had already given in beforehand.\n[1965-03-08 16:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her waiting for Stefano to say something to her. I heard, \"Thank you for your understanding. I love you very much. You know, sometimes there are things we have to do that way.\"\n[1965-03-08 16:00:10] Lina's house | I saw that only at this moment, she let Stefano hold her shoulder and kiss her neck.\n[1965-03-08 16:00:20] Lina's house | I saw her, but she suddenly turned around, looked into his eyes, and said to him. I heard, \"My wedding, Marcello absolutely can't show up.\"\n[1965-03-08 16:00:30] Lina's house | I heard \"What should I do?\"\n[1965-03-08 16:00:40] Lina's House | I heard, \"I don't know, but you have to swear to me.\"",

I heard, \"Okay, Lina, I swear to you.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:00:00] Lina's House | I saw that March 12th had arrived, spring had come, and the weather was very warm.\n[1965-03-12 08:10:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina hoping I would come to her house early to help her bathe, comb her hair, and get dressed.\n[1965-03-12 08:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her send my mother away, leaving just the two of us together.\n[1965-03-12 08:20:00] Lina's House | I saw her sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing only her underwear and a bra. I saw the wedding dress lying beside her, and it looked like a corpse.\n[1965-03-12 08:20:10] Lina's house | I saw in front of her a copper basin filled with steaming hot water, resting on a floor made of hexagonal wooden tiles.\n[1965-03-12 08:20:20] Lina's House | I heard her suddenly ask me, \"Do you think I made a mistake?\"\n[1965-03-12 08:20:30] Lina's house | \"What's the matter?\"\n[1965-03-12 08:20:40] Lina's house | I heard \"marry.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:20:50] Lina's house | I heard, \"Are you still thinking about the marriage counselor?\"\n[1965-03-12 08:21:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"No, I was thinking about our primary school teacher. Why didn't she let me into her house?\"\n[1965-03-12 08:21:10] Lina's House | I heard, \"Because she's a peculiar old woman.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:21:20] Lina's house | I saw her fall silent for a moment, staring at the shiny water in the basin.\n[1965-03-12 08:21:30] Lina's house | I heard and said, \"No matter what happens, you must keep learning.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:21:40] Lina's house | I heard, \"There's still two years until I get my high school diploma, then I'll be done.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:21:50] Lina's House | \"I heard, 'No, it's never ending. I'll give you money; you have to keep learning.'\"\n[1965-03-12 08:22:00] Lina's House | I saw myself smiling uneasily. I heard her say, \"Thank you. Once you've reached a certain point, there's nothing more to learn.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:22:10] Lina's House | I heard, \"But you're different. You're my brilliant friend, you should be better than anyone, whether a boy or a girl.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:22:20] Lina's house | I saw her get up, take off her underwear and bra and say. I heard, \"Help me, or it's too late.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:22:30] Lina's house | I thought about how I had never seen her completely naked, which made me feel a bit embarrassed.\n[1965-03-12 08:22:40] Lina's house | I realized that at the time, my embarrassment was because I was attracted to her perfect body, and I had witnessed her beauty at sixteen.\n[1965-03-12 08:22:50] Lina's house | I thought about how, in a few hours, Stefano would touch her, enter her, change her, possibly making her pregnant.\n[1965-03-12 08:23:00] Lina's house | I thought back to that time, and all I could feel was my thoughts flying in all directions, though I wasn't entirely willing, I was doing something that had to be done.\n[1965-03-12 08:23:10] Lina's house | I thought that in that specific situation, I couldn't look away or take my hand off, because I was afraid she would sense my anxiety.\n[1965-03-12 08:23:20] Lina's house | I thought that if I backed out, she would sense my troubled thoughts and thus shatter her calm, innocent state.\n[1965-03-12 08:23:30] Lina's house | I saw that I couldn't let her see the storm within me, so I had to stay and help her bathe.\n[1965-03-12 08:23:40] Lina's house | I saw my gaze fall on her boyish shoulders, her firm breasts, narrow hips, sturdy buttocks, dark private area, long legs, elegantly shaped knees and ankles, and graceful feet.\n[1965-03-12 08:23:50] Lina's House | I saw myself acting as if nothing was wrong, because everything was inevitable. I saw the dilapidated, dark little room, surrounded by broken furniture, with an old floor splattered with water stains and full of cracks. I thought of it and my heart surged with excitement, my blood boiled.\n[1965-03-12 08:25:00] Lina's house | I watched as I very slowly and carefully washed her.\n[1965-03-12 08:26:00] Lina's house | I watched as I first had her sit in the tub, gently washing her, then helped her stand up.\n[1965-03-12 08:27:00] Lina's house | I still hear the sound of dripping water in my ears. I thought about how I still remember the feeling at that time: the texture of the copper basin felt the same as Lina's skin, both smooth, solid, and calm.\n[1965-03-12 08:28:00] Lina's house | I thought of all the chaotic things on my mind: hugging her, crying with her, touching her intimately, pulling her hair, laughing together, pretending to be experienced in sex, lecturing her loudly, and pushing her away at the most intimate moment.\n[1965-03-12 08:28:10] Lina's house | The one thought that wouldn't leave me was: in the early morning, I washed her from head to toe, and in the evening, Stefano would completely defile her.\n[1965-03-12 08:28:20] Lina's house | I imagine her, naked, held tightly by her husband in their new home, on their bed, as a train rumbles beneath their window, making a clattering sound. He enters her roughly and decisively, just like a cork slips into a wine bottle neck.\n[1965-03-12 08:28:30] Lina's house | I thought to myself that the only way to fight against the pain I felt, or might feel, was to find a very secluded place where Antonio would do the same thing to me at the same time.\n[1965-03-12 08:35:00] Lina's house | I saw myself drying her body and dressing her in her undergarments and wedding dress.\n[1965-03-12 08:40:00] Lina's house | I thought with a mix of pride and sadness, I thought: This wedding dress was chosen by me for her.\n[1965-03-12 08:45:00] Lina's house | I saw the wedding dress come alive on her body. I saw the white fabric wrapping her warmth, setting off her red lips and those dark, bright eyes.\n[1965-03-12 08:50:00] Lina's house | I watched until the end, when she put on the shoes she had designed herself, which Rino had asked her to wear. If she didn't wear them, her brother would see it as a betrayal.\n[1965-03-12 08:55:00] Lina's house | I saw her choose a pair of shoes with not very high heels, so she wouldn't be much taller than Stefano.\n[1965-03-12 08:55:10] Lina's house | I saw her lift her skirt and glance at the mirror.\n[1965-03-12 08:55:20] Lina's house | I heard her say, \"These shoes are too ugly.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:55:30] Lina's house | I heard, \"I'm not ugly at all.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:55:40] Lina's house | I saw her smiling in a rather stiff way. I heard, \"It's really ugly, look! Your dream in your mind is now being trampled underfoot.\"\n[1965-03-12 08:55:50] Lina's house | I saw her suddenly turn her face toward me, her eyes full of fear as she asked. \"I heard, 'Lena, what will happen to me?'\"\n[1965-03-12 09:00:00] Lina's Kitchen | I saw Fernando and Nunzia had been waiting for us in the kitchen for a long time.\n[1965-03-12 09:00:10] Lina's kitchen | I knew they had been prepared for a long time. I thought to myself that I had never seen them take such good care.\n[1965-03-12 09:00:20] Lina's kitchen | I thought back then, Lina's parents, my parents, and all the other parents seemed very old to me.\n[1965-03-12 09:00:30] Lina's Kitchen | I thought they didn't differ much from my grandfather and grandmother, or my maternal grandfather and grandmother.\n[1965-03-12 09:00:40] Lina's kitchen | I thought that, in my eyes, they all carried a cold, lifeless existence, completely unrelated to my own, Lina's, Stefano's, Antonio's, and Pasquale's lives.\n[1965-03-12 09:00:50] Kitchen of Lina's house | I thought about how we people are completely immersed in our own passions, full of thoughts and full of enthusiasm.\n[1965-03-12 09:01:00] Lina's kitchen | I thought, as I wrote these words, that Fernando must have been younger than forty-five back then, and Nunzia somewhat younger than him.\n[1965-03-12 09:01:10] Lina's kitchen | I saw them waiting in the kitchen that morning. I saw him in a white shirt and black suit, looking like the American actor Randolph Scott. Nunzia was wearing a sky-blue outfit, a sky-blue hat on her head, and a blue veil over her face. Both of them looked very respectable.\n[1965-03-12 09:01:20] Lina's kitchen | I thought about my parents too; I clearly remember their ages back then: my father was thirty-nine, my mother thirty-five.\n[1965-03-12 10:00:00] Church | I watched them in the church for a long time. I felt very troubled because on that day, my excellent grades at school could not comfort them at all.\n[1965-03-12 10:00:10] Church | I thought the opposite; they—especially my mother—thought that sending me to school was a waste of time, useless.\n[1965-03-12 10:30:00] Church | I saw Lina arm-in-arm with the cobbler heading toward the Church of the Holy Family, where she would meet Stefano. I saw Lina in that shiny, dazzling wedding dress, behind a sheer curtain, radiant and breathtaking.\n[1965-03-12 10:30:10] Church | I saw Stefano standing on the altar covered with flowers. I saw Stefano that day, and he was also dashing; the flowers provided by the gardener were truly abundant.\n[1965-03-12 10:35:00] Church | I thought of my mother—although her squinted eye seemed to be looking elsewhere, it was really on me—which made me feel pressured, made me feel like I was wearing glasses and no one noticed me, while my bad friend had found a rich husband, owned a family business, and had her own house with a big bathtub, an electric refrigerator, and a TV and a telephone.\n[1965-03-12 11:00:00] Church | I knew the wedding ceremony would be very long, and the priest presiding was tedious, never ending.\n[1965-03-12 11:00:10] Church | I saw that in the church, the relatives and friends of the groom were gathered on one side, and those of the bride on the other.\n[1965-03-12 11:00:20] Church | I saw the photographer constantly taking photos, while a young assistant filmed the important moments beside him. I saw the flashlights and reflectors, which were dazzling.\n[1965-03-12 11:05:00] Church | I saw Antonio sitting beside me, wearing a suit made to measure by the tailor.\n[1965-03-12 11:05:10] Church | I saw him have his sister Pinocchia take care of their mother. I thought Pinocchia was very impatient, because as the salesperson for Capodimonte, the groom, she could have stayed in another position, but instead she had to stay by Melina's side, watching over her along with a few of her brothers and sisters.\n[1965-03-12 11:05:20] Church | I saw Antonio say something to me in my ear once or twice, but I didn't answer him.\n[1965-03-12 11:05:30] Church | I thought his job was to stay by my side, but not act too close, so people wouldn't talk.\n[1965-03-12 11:10:00] Church | I saw my gaze sweep across the crowded church, and I saw that people were getting impatient, all of them looking around like me.\n[1965-03-12 11:10:10] Church | I see and I smell the air filled with the fragrance of flowers and the scent of new clothes.\n[1965-03-12 11:10:20] Church | I saw Giggia as very beautiful, and also Camilla Peluso was very pretty.\n[1965-03-12 11:10:30] Church | I saw those young men weren't any less impressive. Enzo, especially Pasquale, were dressed extravagantly, as if they were about to be sacrificed on an altar, trying to outdo Stefano in elegance and to be more worthy of Lina.\n[1965-03-12 11:10:40] Church | I saw the mason Pasquale and the fruit and vegetable vendor Enzo standing at the back of the church, like two sentinels, ensuring the wedding went smoothly.\n[1965-03-12 11:10:50] Church | I saw Rino; as the brother of the bride, he broke the rules by not staying with the bride's relatives, but instead remained by Pinochia's side, among the groom's relatives and friends.\n[1965-03-12 11:11:00] Church | I saw that he was also wearing a brand-new outfit, with \"Lina\" shoes on his feet, shiny and impressive, and his hair was glossy and well-kempt.\n[1965-03-12 11:11:10] Church | I knew it was obvious that everyone who received an invitation came to the wedding, all dressed nicely. As far as I know, the expenses were no small amount, which was also clearly visible to everyone at the time.\n[1965-03-12 11:11:20] Church | I thought first of Antonio sitting next to me--his clothes should have been made with borrowed money.\n[1965-03-12 11:11:30] Church | I saw Silvio Solara. I saw him, strong-built, dressed in black, standing beside the groom, his wrist shining with gold.\n[1965-03-12 11:11:40] Church | I saw his wife, Manuela. I saw her, dressed in gold and silver, wearing a pink outfit, standing beside the bride.\n[1965-03-12 11:11:50] Church | I knew that everyone used the money to dress up, which had been borrowed from the Solara couple. After Don Achille died, everyone in the neighborhood needed to borrow money, and they all went to this man--his face was purplish, his eyes blue, his temples were bald; and there was also the thin woman, with a long nose and thin lips.\n[1965-03-12 11:12:00] Church | I know, more specifically, it was Manuela who was handling the details. She had a red leather ledger in which she recorded the amounts borrowed and the due dates—everyone knew it, everyone feared it.\n[1965-03-12 11:12:10] Church | I knew that Lina's wedding was not only a good thing for the flower shop owner and the photographer, but especially for the couple themselves. In addition to providing loans, they also supplied the cake and wedding candies.\n[1965-03-12 11:15:00] Church | I saw that Lina never looked at them properly. She didn't look at Stefano either, just stared at the priest.\n[1965-03-12 11:15:10] Church | I thought to myself, from behind, they didn't seem very well-matched. Lina was very tall, while Stefano wasn't as tall as Lina; Lina shone brightly, drawing attention, while he seemed like a dim little figure; Lina was very focused, as if trying desperately to understand the deeper meaning of the ritual, while Stefano occasionally turned around to look at his mother, or smiled briefly at Silvio Solara, scratching his head lightly.\n[1965-03-12 11:15:20] Church | I thought to myself, suddenly very worried—was Stefano really different from how he appeared?\n[1965-03-12 11:20:00] Church | I saw it, but for two reasons I didn't dwell on it: first, the bride and groom both spoke firmly and decisively. I heard \"I do.\"\n[1965-03-12 11:20:10] Church | I saw they were all very excited, they exchanged rings, [intimate gesture]. I thought that Lina had really gotten married, and I had to accept this fact.\n[1965-03-12 11:25:00] Church | I realized there was another reason: I stopped paying attention to the bride and groom. Suddenly, I saw everyone except Alfonso Carracci. I searched for him in the line of the bride's and groom's relatives with my eyes.\n[1965-03-12 11:25:10] Church | I saw him at the very back of the church, behind a column.\n[1965-03-12 11:25:20] Church | I saw myself making a gesture to him, and when he saw me, he came toward me, followed by Pinocchia Nino in her elaborate outfit.\n[1965-03-12 11:25:30] Church | I saw that Nino also appeared quickly. I saw him again, thin and tall, his hands in his pockets, his hair messy, wearing the same clothes he used to wear to school.\n[1965-03-12 11:40:00] At the church entrance | I saw a crowd surrounding the bride and groom as they exited the church. I saw the band playing music, and the photographers' flashes accompanied them.\n[1965-03-12 11:45:00] Front of the Church | I saw Lina and Stefano stop on the empty space in front of the church, and relatives and friends gathered around [intimate gesture] them, hugging them.",

    "text": "[1965-03-12 11:45:10] The empty space in front of the church | I saw around me the messy cars, the anxious family members waiting, and other people—though they had no blood relation to me, they were more important, more respected, dressed more extravagantly, those ladies wearing strange-looking hats.\n[1965-03-12 11:50:00] Front of the Church | I saw the important guests quickly get into the cars and be driven to the restaurant on Horace Street.\n[1965-03-12 11:50:10] Front of the Church | I thought about how proper Alfonso Carracci looked in his clothes! I had never seen him in a dark suit, a white shirt, and a tie. This was completely different from his simple clothing at school and the white lab coat he wore in Capodimonte.\n[1965-03-12 11:50:20] The empty space in front of the church | I thought he was sixteen then, but he looked older than his actual age. It was as if, all of a sudden, his body had developed completely differently from his brother Stefano's.\n[1965-03-12 11:50:30] The empty space in front of the church | I thought he was taller and thinner, and I found him resembling a Spanish ballet dancer I had seen on television back then: large eyes, thick lips, and not a single hair on his face.\n[1965-03-12 11:50:40] The empty space in front of the church | I thought it was obvious that Pinocchia had hit his weak spot, and their relationship had moved a step closer. Without my knowledge, they must have already met.\n[1965-03-12 11:50:50] Front of the Church | I wondered whether, despite Alfonso Carracci's deep interest in me, he had still been captivated by Pinocchia's long, wavy hair, by her eloquence and fluent dialogue? He was so shy, could her talkativeness fill the silences between their conversations?\n[1965-03-12 11:51:00] The empty space in front of the church | I wonder if they're together? I doubt it. If they were, Alfonso Carracci would have told me.\n[1965-03-12 11:51:10] The empty space in front of the church | I thought, but it was obvious that their relationship had reached a point where Alfonso Carracci invited her to her brother's wedding. And she, in order to get her parents' permission, had also forced Nino to come along.\n[1965-03-12 11:55:00] The empty space in front of the church | I saw that they were all there, on the open ground in front of the church. I saw Nino, his clothes wrinkled, his height too tall, his body too thin, his hair too long and messy. He had his hands in his pants pockets, standing out completely from the surroundings, looking utterly lost.\n[1965-03-12 11:55:10] The empty space in front of the church | I saw him looking at the bride and groom just like everyone else, but he showed no interest, which was only because he didn't know what to look at.\n[1965-03-12 11:55:20] The empty space in front of the church | I thought about his unexpected appearance, which left me very flustered.\n[1965-03-12 11:55:30] Front of the Church | I saw us greeting each other quietly in the church. I heard \"Hi!\" \"Hi!\"\n[1965-03-12 11:55:40] The empty space in front of the church | I saw Nino, after greeting everyone, stay with his sister and Alfonso Carracci.\n[1965-03-12 11:55:50] The empty space in front of the church | I saw Antonio gripping my arm tightly, but I soon freed myself from him.\n[1965-03-12 11:56:00] Front of the Church | I saw myself at the end with Pinocchio, Melina, Pasquale, Camilla, and Enzo.\n[1965-03-12 12:00:00] The empty space in front of the church | I saw the bride and groom, seated in a large white car amid the messy crowd, leaving with the photographer and his assistant to take pictures at the Memorial Park.\n[1965-03-12 12:00:10] The empty space in front of the church | I thought of how suddenly I worried that Antonio's mother might recognize Nino, that she might see Donato's shadow in the contour of his face, but this worry was unnecessary.\n[1965-03-12 12:00:20] The empty space in front of the church | I saw Lina's mother Nunzia pull the crazy Melina to her side, and then she, Pinocchia, and several children got into a car and left together.\n[1965-03-12 12:05:00] Front of the Church Yard | I saw that, in fact, no one recognized Nino, not even Giggia, and neither did Carmela or Enzo.\n[1965-03-12 12:05:10] The empty space in front of the church | I saw that they hadn't noticed Pinocchia either, despite her still retaining some childhood features, and no one noticed the Nino siblings.\n[1965-03-12 12:05:20] The empty space in front of the church | I saw that, and Antonio pushed me onto Pasquale's old car, where we sat together with Carmela and Enzo.\n[1965-03-12 12:05:30] In Pasquale's car | I kept asking, \"Where are my parents? I hope someone will take care of them.\" I heard Enzo answer that he had seen them get into a car, and in any case, I couldn't think of any other excuse to stay behind, so we left.\n[1965-03-12 12:05:40] In Pasquale's car | I only had time to glance at them before the car drove off. I saw Nino still standing at the church entrance, completely bewildered, while Alfonso Carracci spoke with Pinochia.\n[1965-03-12 12:10:00] In Pasquale's car | I noticed Antonio was sensitive to my changing emotions; he whispered in my ear. I thought about how I had become very anxious.\n[1965-03-12 12:10:10] In Pasquale's car | I heard \"What's wrong with you?\"\n[1965-03-12 12:10:20] In Pasquale's car | I heard \"It's nothing.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:10:30] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"What's making you uncomfortable?\"\n[1965-03-12 12:10:40] In Pasquale's car | I heard \"It's nothing.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:10:50] In Pasquale's car | I saw Camilla smiling. I heard, \"She saw Lina get married and now she also wants to get married; she's getting impatient.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:11:00] In Pasquale's car | \"I don't want to get married?\" Enzo asked.\n[1965-03-12 12:11:10] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"Me? If I could, I'd get married tomorrow.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:11:20] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"With whom?\"\n[1965-03-12 12:11:30] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"I know who it is!\"\n[1965-03-12 12:11:40] In Pasquale's car | I heard \"Shut up!\" Pasquale said, \"No one will marry you.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:15:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw us driving toward the sea, Pasquale driving recklessly, Antonio had modified his car, and he drove it like a sports car.\n[1965-03-12 12:15:10] In Pasquale's car | I saw the car roaring as it sped away. I saw her completely ignoring the bumpy, uneven road.\n[1965-03-12 12:15:20] In Pasquale's car | I saw him catch up with the car in front of him quickly, then overtake them rapidly, as if he were going to crash into them. But just before the collision, he slammed on the brakes and quickly turned the steering wheel to pass the cars.\n[1965-03-12 12:15:30] In Pasquale's car | I saw the girls and I shouting in fear, angrily telling him to be careful. He laughed, becoming even more arrogant.\n[1965-03-12 12:15:40] In Pasquale's car | I saw Antonio and Enzo not even blinking, they would say a few harsh words, cursing the people who were driving slowly. They rolled down their windows, and when Pasquale overtook them, they shouted some curses.\n[1965-03-12 12:20:00] In Pasquale's car | I thought about the ride down Horace Street, and it was then that I began to clearly feel that I didn't fit in with the others, and it made me very unhappy.\n[1965-03-12 12:20:10] In Pasquale's car | I thought about how I grew up with those kids, and I felt their actions were perfectly normal. Their violent language also belonged to my world, but my daily life took a different path.\n[1965-03-12 12:20:20] In Pasquale's car | I thought it had been six years, and the life I had experienced was something they didn't understand. I had moved forward smoothly and invincibly along this path.\n[1965-03-12 12:20:30] In Pasquale's car | I thought about being with them, and I realized that all the things I had learned in my daily life were of no use. I had to restrain myself and lower myself to fit in with them.\n[1965-03-12 12:20:40] In Pasquale's car | I thought about the things at school, which I had to put in parentheses, and sometimes I took them out to scare them a bit.\n[1965-03-12 12:20:50] In Pasquale's car | I thought about the car, and I wondered what I was really doing? The car was with my friend, of course, and my boyfriend as well. We were going to Lina's wedding, but it was exactly that wedding that made Lina—the only person I felt had something in common with me, even though our lives were completely different—no longer belong to us.\n[1965-03-12 12:21:00] In Pasquale's car | I thought about how, without her, the connection between me and these young people, and the connection between me and this Mercedes car, would both disappear.\n[1965-03-12 12:21:10] In Pasquale's car | I thought about why I didn't end up with Alfonso Carracci? I know, my situation was the same as his, we both would have escaped from here.\n[1965-03-12 12:21:20] In Pasquale's car | I thought, especially, why I didn't stop and let Nino stay for the wedding feast, ask him when the magazine with my article would come out, talk to him, create a space for myself away from Pasquale's driving, away from his vulgarity, away from Camilla and Enzo's rude remarks, and Antonio's vulgar and violent nature.",

Antonio was pressed close to me, trying to make me laugh.\n[1965-03-12 12:31:00] Restaurant | I saw my mother calling me, and I pretended not to hear. She called me a few more times, but I still didn't answer.\n[1965-03-12 12:31:10] Restaurant | I saw that, and she stood up, limping toward me. She wanted me to sit next to her, but I refused.\n[1965-03-12 12:31:20] Restaurant | I saw her say it with a fierce expression. I heard, \"Why has Melina's son been circling around you?\"\n[1965-03-12 12:31:30] Restaurant | I heard, \"Mom, no one is circling around me.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:31:40] Restaurant | I heard, \"Do you think I'm stupid?\"\n[1965-03-12 12:31:50] Restaurant | I heard \"No.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:32:00] Restaurant | I heard, \"Come sit next to me.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:32:10] Restaurant | I heard \"No!\"\n[1965-03-12 12:32:20] Restaurant | \"I told you, come over here right away. We're supporting your education, not letting you get ruined by a worker, and besides, his mother's a madwoman.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:32:30] Restaurant | I saw that I had yielded to her will. I thought of her furious.\n[1965-03-12 12:35:00] Restaurant | I saw other young people arriving slowly as well, all friends of Stefano.\n[1965-03-12 12:35:10] Restaurant | I saw Giggia in the group; she signaled me to come over, but my mother pulled me back.\n[1965-03-12 12:35:20] Restaurant | I saw Pasquale, Camilla, Enzo, and Antonio finally sitting down with Giggia.\n[1965-03-12 12:35:30] Restaurant | I saw Pinocchio finally free from her mother, handed over to Nunzia. Pinocchio came over and whispered in my ear. I heard, \"Come here.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:35:40] Restaurant | I tried to stand up, but my mother angrily grabbed my arm.\n[1965-03-12 12:35:50] Restaurant | I saw Pinocchia looking regretful and ran to sit next to her brother Antonio.\n[1965-03-12 12:36:00] Restaurant | I saw Antonio glancing at me now and then. I made a gesture to him, looking at the ceiling, meaning I couldn't leave.\n[1965-03-12 12:40:00] Restaurant | I saw the band start playing, and the singer, who was in his forties and almost bald, had sharp facial features. He hummed a few lines of the lyrics to test the sound.\n[1965-03-12 12:45:00] Restaurant | I saw other guests had arrived too; the whole hall was crowded with people, all looking very hungry, but we had to wait for the bride and groom.\n[1965-03-12 12:45:10] Restaurant | I saw myself trying to get up, and my mother harshly said to me. I heard, \"You have to stay by my side.\"\n[1965-03-12 12:45:20] Restaurant | I wanted to stay by her side. I watched her anger, her stubborn behavior, and I thought she really didn't realize how contradictory she was.\n[1965-03-12 12:45:30] Restaurant | I thought she hadn't wanted me to go to school, but I had gone anyway, and she then considered me the most outstanding among the group of kids I grew up with. She was convinced that, under the circumstances, I couldn't sit with them.\n[1965-03-12 12:45:40] Restaurant | I thought about how she forced me to stay with her. I didn't know what kind of danger Antonio represented in her eyes? Was he like a stormy sea, or whirlpools and rushing currents?\n[1965-03-12 12:45:50] Restaurant | I thought that being with her meant staying in her world, becoming just like her. If I ended up becoming just like her, who else could I possibly find instead of a man like Antonio?\n[1965-03-12 13:00:00] Restaurant | I saw that, at this moment, the bride and groom entered, and everyoneburst into warm applause, and the band immediately started playing the wedding march. \n\n(Note: \"burst into warm applause\" is translated as \"cheered loudly\" or \"applauded enthusiastically\" for natural English expression.)\n\nCorrected translation: \n\nI saw that, at this moment, the bride and groom entered, and everyone cheered loudly, and the band immediately started playing the wedding march.\n[1965-03-12 13:00:10] Restaurant | I saw myself staying close to my mother, pressed right against her. I felt the sense of alienation growing stronger.\n[1965-03-12 13:00:20] Restaurant | Everyone in the neighborhood came to celebrate Lina's wedding. She looked very happy, smiling gracefully and appearing extremely elegant.\n[1965-03-12 13:00:30] Restaurant | I saw her holding hands with her husband. I thought it was absolutely beautiful.\n[1965-03-12 13:00:40] Restaurant | I thought I had always been watching her—how she walked, her body—just to escape my mother's influence on me. I was wrong. Lina stayed there, bound by the way of life in that world, and believed she had found the best possible arrangement. That young man was the best choice she could make in this world.\n[1965-03-12 13:00:50] Restaurant | I thought about the wedding, which was the best path for Rino and her father's shoemaking business. Our lives had long since diverged—hers and mine had no common ground anymore. Suddenly, I felt extremely lonely.\n[1965-03-12 13:10:00] Restaurant | I saw everyone shouting, urging the two new people to dance first. They twirled around in the hall under the flashing lights, their movements very precise.\n[1965-03-12 13:10:10] Restaurant | I thought I had to take action to escape from my mother's world, although even Lina hadn't managed to escape it. But I had to, I couldn't keep submitting myself like this anymore.\n[1965-03-12 13:10:20] Restaurant | I thought I should erase Lina from my life, as Professor Oliviero had asked me to do when he came to our house—he did it for my own good.\n[1965-03-12 13:10:30] Restaurant | I thought of my mother holding my arm, and I should have ignored her. I wanted to think about how I was the best at Italian, Latin, and Greek. I needed to remember that an article of mine would be published in a magazine, and that a very handsome, outstanding senior boy also wrote for that same magazine.\n[1965-03-12 13:15:00] Restaurant | I saw Nino entering the restaurant. Before I saw Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia, I saw him first.\n[1965-03-12 13:15:10] Restaurant | The moment I saw him, I immediately stood up. My mother grabbed my skirt, but I quickly shook her off.\n[1965-03-12 13:15:20] Restaurant | I saw Antonio keeping his eyes on me, his face brightened, and he gave me an inviting look.\n[1965-03-12 13:15:30] Restaurant | I saw that at this moment, Lina and Stefano were walking toward the seat in the middle of the dining room, where the Solara couple and the antique dealers from Mergellina were sitting.\n[1965-03-12 13:15:40] Restaurant | I saw myself leaving them and walking toward the door, heading toward Alfonso Carracci, Pinochia, and Nino.\n[1965-03-12 13:20:00] Restaurant | I saw that we found a place to sit, and I greeted Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia. I thought about hoping that Nino would initiate a conversation with me.\n[1965-03-12 13:20:10] Restaurant | I saw this, and Antonio came up behind me. He bent down and whispered in my ear.\n[1965-03-12 13:20:20] Restaurant | I heard, \"I saved a seat for you.\"\n[1965-03-12 13:20:30] Restaurant | I heard myself whisper, \"Go, my mother has already found out.\"\n[1965-03-12 13:20:40] Restaurant | I saw him nervously glance around, a bit shy, and then return to his seat.\n[1965-03-12 13:25:00] Restaurant | I saw a murmur of dissatisfaction spread through the restaurant. The disgruntled guests immediately protested, saying that the drinks at each table were different, and that some tables had already received the first course while others hadn't even gotten the appetizers yet.\n[1965-03-12 13:25:10] Restaurant | I saw that people had already started shouting, saying that the tables and service for the groom's relatives were better than those for the bride's side. I thought about how I felt the tension and agitation in the air.\n[1965-03-12 13:30:00] Restaurant | I forced myself to stay alert and pulled Nino into our conversation, asking him to tell me about his article on San Gregorio Armeno's poverty and backwardness. I thought about my purpose: after he finished speaking, I would naturally bring up the next issue of the magazine and my short article.\n[1965-03-12 13:30:10] Restaurant | I immediately started talking to him about the situation in the city, and he spoke very interestingly, full of information. The certainty in his tone attracted me. On Ischia, he had been an anxious teenager, but now I felt he had become too mature: as an eighteen-year-old boy, he didn't talk about the generally tragic and poor life here with the kind of deep sorrow that Pasquale did.\n[1965-03-12 13:30:20] Restaurant | I thought about Nino's calm tone, the specific facts and figures he mentioned—how had he managed to do that?\n[1965-03-12 13:30:30] Restaurant | I heard, \"Where did you learn all this?\"\n[1965-03-12 13:30:40] Restaurant | I heard \"read.\"\n[1965-03-12 13:30:50] Restaurant | I heard \"What are you reading?\"\n[1965-03-12 13:31:00] Restaurant | I heard, \"newspapers, magazines, and books that talk about these issues.\"\n[1965-03-12 13:31:10] Restaurant | I thought about how I had never once read a newspaper or a magazine, only novels. Lina was the same; during the time she was reading, besides those worn-out novels from the traveling library, she didn't read anything else.\n[1965-03-12 13:31:20] Restaurant | I thought I had become too outdated, and Nino could help me, filling in the areas I didn't know.\n[1965-03-12 13:35:00] Restaurant | I saw my questions increasing, and he was answering. I thought about it, but when answering my question, he wasn't as sharp as Lina. He didn't have Lina's ability to make anything sound fascinating.\n[1965-03-12 13:35:10] Restaurant | I saw that each of my questions would set him off, making him talk nonstop, without any embellishment or sarcasm, just sharp and blunt. I thought about the way he spoke when discussing issues—scholarly, filled with specific examples.\n[1965-03-12 13:40:00] Restaurant | I saw Alfonso Carracci and Pinocchia quickly feel isolated. Pinocchia started talking to Alfonso Carracci. I heard, \"Oh my God, my brother is so boring!\"\n[1965-03-12 13:40:10] Restaurant | I saw myself talking alone with Nino, and we were unaware of what was happening around us: we didn't know what was on the plate, we didn't know what we were eating or drinking.\n[1965-03-12 13:45:00] Restaurant | I saw myself trying hard to find the question I wanted to ask him, listening intently as he rambled on. I realized quickly that everything he was talking about revolved around a central theme, and every sentence he spoke centered on one point: to reject obscure sentences, clearly point out the problem, propose a feasible solution, and then take action.\n[1965-03-12 13:50:00] Restaurant | I saw myself nodding all along, agreeing with what he was saying. I thought of my slight unease when he spoke about literature.\n[1965-03-12 13:50:10] Restaurant | I saw him say, \"They're all people who spread smoke screens.\" He frowned and repeated it two or three times, saying that the writers—those who spread smoke screens—were his enemies. I heard her say, \"They write novels, and I'm happy to read them, but if it's about really changing reality, that's another matter.\"\n[1965-03-12 13:50:20] Restaurant | I thought that, in his understanding, he used the word \"literature\" to oppose those who corrupted people's minds, and he said that literature was nothing but useless chatter.\n[1965-03-12 13:50:30] Restaurant | I heard his response to my weak objection: \"There are too many bad knight stories, Rino! They created a Don Quixote, and we respect Don Quixote, but in San Gregorio Armeno, we don't need him. We don't need to fight windmills—that's just a waste of time. We need people who understand how windmills work and can make them function.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:00:00] Restaurant | I thought to myself, quickly, I wish I could discuss with guys of this level every day: how many mistakes have I made with him! I longed for him so much, loved him, yet I kept avoiding him—that was such a foolish way to act!\n[1965-03-12 14:00:10] Restaurant | I thought it was his father's fault, but it was also mine. I had completely rejected my mother, yet I allowed the ugly shadow of his father to fall upon his son? I regretted it. I was glad I had woken up in time, but I also regretted how deeply I had immersed myself in that novel's world.\n[1965-03-12 14:00:20] Restaurant | At that moment, I had to raise my voice to talk to him, and he also spoke loudly to me. I saw the restaurant filled with loud music and the sound of people talking.\n[1965-03-12 14:00:30] Restaurant | I saw several times, I looked toward the table where Lina was sitting: she was laughing, eating, talking. I thought she didn't even know where I was sitting or who I was talking to.\n[1965-03-12 14:00:40] Restaurant | I looked over to the table where Antonio was sitting a few times, and I was worried he might call me over, but I saw that his eyes were filled with anger when he looked at me, and I felt good.\n[1965-03-12 14:00:50] Restaurant | I thought to myself: There's no other way, it has to be this way. I've already decided to break up with him tomorrow. I can't continue being with him; the differences between us are too great.\n[1965-03-12 14:01:00] Restaurant | I thought, of course, he really likes me, he's completely devoted to me, loyal like a little dog. The way Nino spoke to me made me find him fascinating, without any sense of subordination.\n[1965-03-12 14:01:10] Restaurant | I thought about how he had shown me his future and the foundation of his thoughts. I listened to him, and felt my mind being illuminated, just like Lina had once enlightened me. What he said helped me grow.\n[1965-03-12 14:01:20] Restaurant | I thought he would pull me out of my mother's world, and he was also trying his best to free himself from his father's influence.\n[1965-03-12 14:05:00] Restaurant | I felt someone touching my shoulder, and it was again Antonio. He said with a dark expression. I heard, \"Let's dance.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:05:10] Restaurant | I heard myself whisper, \"My mother doesn't agree.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:05:20] Restaurant | I heard the anxiety in his voice and shouted back, \"Everyone is dancing, what's the problem?\"\n[1965-03-12 14:05:30] Restaurant | I saw myself offering Nino an awkward smile. I thought to myself that he clearly knew that Antonio was my boyfriend.\n[1965-03-12 14:05:40] Restaurant | I saw him look at me seriously and then start talking to Alfonso Carracci. I went to dance.",

The bride's relatives all looked unhappy, they were arguing loudly, especially the women.\n[1965-03-12 14:10:20] Restaurant | I thought about how much money they had spent preparing gifts and dressing up. They had borrowed money to keep up appearances, and now they were being treated like beggars—poor wine, and the food came so slowly it was unbearable.\n[1965-03-12 14:10:30] Restaurant | Why didn't Lina intervene? Why didn't she protest in front of Stefano?\n[1965-03-12 14:10:40] Restaurant | I thought about how I knew them—out of love for Lina, they would restrain their anger.\n[1965-03-12 14:10:50] Restaurant | I thought that after the wedding banquet, Lina would go change clothes, return in her traveling outfit to hand out wedding candies, and then leave with her husband looking beautifully dressed. Then, an unprecedented quarrel would break out, giving rise to hatred that would last for months, even years. The revenge and insults would involve their husbands and sons as well, who would show their mothers, sisters, and grandmothers that they were real men.\n[1965-03-12 14:11:00] Restaurant | I saw that I knew all the people here, all the men and women. I saw those young men looking at the singer and the band members with hatred, because they had looked at their girlfriends in a suggestive way.\n[1965-03-12 14:11:10] Restaurant | I saw how Enzo and Camilla spoke while dancing, and I saw Pasquale and Pinochia sitting at the table. I thought it was obvious that after this wedding, they would be together, get engaged soon, and most likely get married after a year or so.\n[1965-03-12 14:11:20] Restaurant | I saw Rino and Pinocchia: they might move faster if the \"Lina\" shoe shop really got going. In at most a year, another wedding would be held, as grand as Lina's.\n[1965-03-12 14:11:30] Restaurant | I saw them dancing together, their eyes locked, tightly embracing each other. I thought about love and interest, Capodimonte and the shoe factory, the old building and the new building. Am I like them? Am I still like them?\n[1965-03-12 14:15:00] Dining Room Dance Floor | I heard \"Who was he?\" Antonio asked me.\n[1965-03-12 14:15:10] Dining Room Dance Floor | I heard, \"Who else could it be? Didn't you recognize him?\"\n[1965-03-12 14:15:20] Dining Room Dance Floor | I heard, \"No.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:15:30] Dining Room Dance Floor | I heard, \"He's Nino's older son, Nino, and Pinochia, do you remember?\"\n[1965-03-12 14:15:40] Dining Room Dance Floor | I saw him say angrily. I thought he didn't care at all who Pinocchio was, he only cared about Nino.\n[1965-03-12 14:15:50] Dining Room Dance Floor | \"I heard you said, 'You take me to see Nino and tell him not to come here anymore, and then you spent hours talking with his son? I made a new dress just to see you having such a great time with him? He didn't even cut his hair or tie his tie!\"\n[1965-03-12 14:16:00] Restaurant | I saw him leave me in the center of the hall and hurry toward the glass door on the rooftop.\n[1965-03-12 14:16:10] Restaurant | I saw myself hesitating for a few seconds, unsure whether to go after Antonio or return to Nino.\n[1965-03-12 14:16:20] Restaurant | I saw my mother watching me, though her cross eye seemed to be looking elsewhere; my father was also watching me, his gaze somewhat fierce.\n[1965-03-12 14:16:30] Restaurant | I thought to myself: If I had gone back to Nino, if I hadn't met Antonio on the rooftop, it would have been him who dumped me, and that would have been best.\n[1965-03-12 14:17:00] Restaurant | I saw the band still playing as I passed through the hall, and people still dancing in pairs. I returned to my seat.\n[1965-03-12 14:20:00] Restaurant | I saw that Nino seemed to have noticed nothing at all. I thought of him then, talking about Professor Galiani in his usual, endless way, arguing with Alfonso Carracci, defending Professor Galiani, because I knew Alfonso Carracci hated Galiani.\n[1965-03-12 14:20:10] Restaurant | I saw Nino say that he often had conflicts with this female teacher—she was too strict, but as a teacher, she was excellent. She always motivated him and taught him how to learn.\n[1965-03-12 14:20:20] Restaurant | I thought I also wanted to interject, I was very eager for Nino to accept me again. I didn't want him to start discussing with me as a classmate, like he had just done.\n[1965-03-12 14:20:30] Restaurant | I thought about wanting to talk to Nino, so as to avoid running to Antonio and crying to him, I said with tears streaming down my face, \"Yes, you're right. I don't know who I am or what I want. I used you and then pushed you away. It's not my fault—I don't know what I'm doing. Forgive me!\"\n[1965-03-12 14:20:40] Restaurant | I needed Nino, needed him to pull me into the things he understood, into his world, to see me as his equal. So I almost snatched the words from his mouth.\n[1965-03-12 14:20:50] Restaurant | I saw him trying hard to pick up our previous conversation. I listed the books the teacher had lent me at the beginning of the semester, as well as the advice she gave me.\n[1965-03-12 14:21:00] Restaurant | I saw him nod, looking a bit annoyed. He mentioned that the teacher had also lent him a book recently, one from the list I had mentioned, and he started talking about that book.\n[1965-03-12 14:21:10] Restaurant | I saw myself suddenly asking him. I thought about it, but I needed more recognition to free myself from Antonio.\n[1965-03-12 14:21:20] Restaurant | I heard, \"When is the magazine coming out?\"\n[1965-03-12 14:21:30] Restaurant | I saw him looking at me with a hesitant gaze, saying with a touch of anxiety. I heard, \"He's already come out, probably two weeks ago.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:21:40] Restaurant | I saw myself cheering and asked him. I heard, \"Where can I find it?\"\n[1965-03-12 14:21:50] Restaurant | I heard, \"They sell it at the Ghiacciu bookstore. I can get it for you.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:22:00] Restaurant | I heard \"Thank you.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:22:10] Restaurant | I saw him hesitate for a moment, then say. I heard, \"They didn't include your article because there was no space left.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:22:20] Restaurant | I saw Alfonso Carracci's face immediately light up with a smile, and he let out a sigh of relief. \"I heard 'That's best.'\"\n[1965-03-12 14:22:30] Restaurant | I saw myself sitting opposite Nino, Alfonso Carracci, and Pinocchia, trying hard to smile. I knew we were sixteen at the time.\n[1965-03-12 14:22:40] Restaurant | I said it as if I were being casual. I heard, \"Well, there will be other opportunities.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:23:00] Restaurant | I saw Stefano speaking in her ear, and she was smiling. I saw Lina at the other end of the restaurant—she was the bride, the queen of the entire banquet.\n[1965-03-12 14:25:00] Restaurant | I saw the band playing, the singer singing. I knew the long, exhausting wedding reception was about to come to an end.\n[1965-03-12 14:25:10] Restaurant | I saw Antonio facing away from me, silently enduring his inner pain as he gazed at the sea. I know his pain is caused by me.\n[1965-03-12 14:25:20] Restaurant | I saw that Rino must have already confessed his love to Pinocchia, and they were now gazing at each other, whispering sweet words. I thought Enzo might be telling Carmela that he loved her.\n[1965-03-12 14:25:30] Restaurant | I saw Pasquale hovering around us, looking somewhat worried. I thought that before the wedding ended, Pinocchia would most likely force him to say what she wanted to hear.\n[1965-03-12 14:26:00] Restaurant | I saw that everyone had already started toasting, interspersed with obscene suggestions. I saw the merchant from Mergellina who was very skilled at this.\n[1965-03-12 14:26:10] Restaurant | I saw the floor already stained with the soup that had spilled from a plate in a child's hand, and red wine that had poured out of Stefano's grandfather's cup was also flowing on the ground.\n[1965-03-12 14:27:00] Restaurant | I saw myself swallowing back my tears. I thought to myself: Maybe they will publish the article I wrote in the next issue of the magazine. Maybe Nino didn't insist on having it included. Maybe I should go to the editorial office myself.\n[1965-03-12 14:27:10] Restaurant | I saw it but said nothing, I kept smiling, even making a joke about it.\n[1965-03-12 14:27:20] Restaurant | I heard, \"I've already argued with the priest once; arguing again would be meaningless.\"\n[1965-03-12 14:27:30] Restaurant | \"I am indeed,\" said Alfonso Carracci.\n[1965-03-12 14:28:00] Restaurant | I saw myself struggling hard, trying to free myself from my depression and pain, but I couldn't. I thought there was nothing that could ease my disappointment.\n[1965-03-12 14:28:10] Restaurant | I thought to myself, if I could publish that article, my name in print would mean I had finally changed my fate, and my hard work would surely elevate me.\n[1965-03-12 14:28:20] Restaurant | I thought that meant Oliviero was right, that she was pushing me forward, making me give up on Lina.\n[1965-03-12 14:28:30] Restaurant | I thought of the question, \"Do you know what a commoner is?\" \"Yes, teacher,\" I replied. In that moment, I understood what a commoner was more clearly than I had when Professor Oliviero asked me a few years ago.\n[1965-03-12 14:28:40] Restaurant | I thought about how we are common people, and common people fight over food and wine, quarreling over the order in which dishes are served and the quality of service.\n[1965-03-12 14:28:50] Restaurant | I saw the dirty floor where the waiters were walking back and forth, and the increasingly vulgar toasts.\n[1965-03-12 14:29:00] Restaurant | I saw her drinking alcohol, and now her whole back was leaning against my father's shoulder. I thought of the common people as my mother.\n[1965-03-12 14:29:10] Restaurant | I saw my father looking serious, and my mother laughing with her mouth wide open. I knew it was because the antique dealer from Mergellina told an obscene joke.\n[1965-03-12 14:29:20] Restaurant | I saw everyone laughing, including Lina. I thought she was going to play her role all the way through.\n[1965-03-12 14:30:00] Restaurant | I saw him get up and say he was leaving. I thought the performance before my eyes might make Nino feel sick.\n[1965-03-12 14:30:10] Restaurant | I knew he had arranged with Pinocchia to return home at a specific time, and Alfonso Carracci had promised to drop her off at the agreed-upon place on time. I thought how happy Pinocchio was to have a devoted knight.\n[1965-03-12 14:30:20] Restaurant | I saw myself hesitantly asking Nino. I heard, \"Aren't you going to greet the bride?\"\n[1965-03-12 14:30:30] Restaurant | I saw him make a gesture, mutter something about his own outfit, and then head toward the door.\n[1965-03-12 14:30:40] Restaurant | I saw that he didn't shake hands with me or Alfonso Carracci, and didn't say a single word of farewell.\n[1965-03-12 14:30:50] Restaurant | I saw the way he walked was still the same as usual, his body slightly swaying.\n[1965-03-12 14:31:00] Restaurant | I thought about how he could freely enter this Mergellina and remain unaffected by the environment, that he could do it, that he had the ability to do it.\n[1965-03-12 14:31:10] Restaurant | I thought that perhaps he had already learned long ago, during that migration that almost cost him his life—the stormy moment.\n[1965-03-12 14:32:00] Restaurant | I thought I doubted whether I could do it, that going to school was useless. I could get a perfect score on exams, but that was only at school.\n[1965-03-12 14:32:10] Restaurant | I thought the people who edited the magazine could sense my cowardice from my summary, from the summaries that I and Lina wrote, and so they didn't publish the article.\n[1965-03-12 14:32:20] Restaurant | I thought of Nino, who was able to do it: his face and gestures, the way he walked had already been revealed, and he would become stronger and stronger.\n[1965-03-12 14:32:30] Restaurant | I saw him disappear. I thought to myself that the only person who could have pulled me out of this restaurant was gone.\n[1965-03-12 14:33:00] Restaurant | I saw the restaurant door shut as if blown by a gust of wind. I thought that in reality there was no wind, and no sound of doors slamming.\n[1965-03-12 14:35:00] Restaurant | I saw the Solara brothers appear, both handsome and well-dressed. I knew that something destined to happen occurred at that moment—when everyone was eating cake and distributing wedding candies.\n[1965-03-12 14:35:10] Restaurant | I saw them walking through the restaurant, greeting many people as if they were the owners.\n[1965-03-12 14:35:20] Restaurant | I saw Giggia suddenly throw herself into Michele's arms and pull him down to sit beside her.\n[1965-03-12 14:35:30] Restaurant | I saw her pull her husband's arm forcefully and say something in his ear. I saw Lina's cheeks and the area around her eyes suddenly turn red.\n[1965-03-12 14:35:40] Restaurant | I saw Silvio greet his two sons weakly, and Manuela looked at them with pride.\n[1965-03-12 14:36:00] Restaurant | I heard the singer perform the song \"Nazzarela,\" imitating Aurelio Fierro's accent. I thought the effect was still okay.\n[1965-03-12 14:36:10] Restaurant | I saw Rino give a very friendly smile and told Marcello to sit next to him. Marcello sat down, loosened his tie, and crossed his legs.\n[1965-03-12 14:37:00] Restaurant | I saw Lina's face turn pale, she became extremely white, just like when she was a child, paler than the white of her wedding dress. I thought that something unexpected would happen, and indeed it did.\n[1965-03-12 14:37:10] Restaurant | I saw her eyes suddenly narrow into a slit.\n[1965-03-12 14:37:20] Restaurant | I saw a bottle of red wine placed in front of her. I thought about how the power in her gaze might shatter that bottle into a thousand pieces.\n[1965-03-12 14:37:30] Restaurant | I saw that she was looking far away, at Marcello's shoes.\n[1965-03-12 14:37:40] Restaurant | I saw it was a pair of \"Lina\" men's shoes, but not the style with a gold buckle that was sold in bulk.\n[1965-03-12 14:37:50] Restaurant | I thought of Marcello's shoes, the pair she had bought for her husband Stefano--\n[1965-03-12 14:38:00] Restaurant | I know it was made by her and Rino. They kept changing it again and again, spending several months on it, wearing their hands down, before they finally made the shoes.",

    "text": "[1965-04-01T10:00:00] Park | I saw that in the new Mergellina there was only a cement road, a small patch of jungle, and some pitiful little trees, so on nice days, Lina started pushing the children to the park in front of the church. Everyone who passed by would stop to look at the child and praise him a bit. I thought that would make her happy.\n[1965-04-01T11:00:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw that if she needed to change a baby's diaper, she would go into the old Capodimonte. As soon as she entered, everyone shopping would gather around little Rino.\n[1965-04-01T11:05:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw Pinocchio wearing a perfectly clean apron, her thin lips painted red, her face pale, her hair neatly combed. She stood in a lofty position in front of Stefano. I saw her becoming more and more reckless, acting like a mistress, very busy indeed.\n[1965-04-01T11:10:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw that she wanted to show, the child and the stroller arriving here troubled her. I thought about it, but Lina didn't seem to care much; it was her husband's strange attitude that really confused her.\n[1965-04-01T11:15:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw that, in private, he didn't have any hostility toward the child, but he was careless. Yet in public, those customers would speak to the child in a very childish, tender voice, wanting to hold the child in their arms and show [affectionate gestures] toward him. I knew that in front of the customers, Stefano wouldn't even glance at the child, acting completely cold-hearted.\n[1965-04-01T11:20:00] Old Capodimonte | I saw Lina go to the back of Capodimonte, wash little Rino clean, quickly dress him, and then immediately return to the small park.\n[1965-04-01T11:30:00] Park | I saw her carefully examining her son in the park, searching his face for traces of Nino. I thought she was wondering if Stefano had seen a feature she hadn't.\n[1965-04-01T12:00:00] Park | I saw it, but she soon stopped worrying about it; days passed, and she felt nothing at all. I thought about how she devoted herself entirely to taking care of the child, how she would spend several weeks reading a single book, reading only two or three pages a day.\n[1965-04-01T12:05:00] Park | I saw that if the child was asleep, she would look at the branches with new leaves growing overhead in the small park, and write a few lines in her crumpled notebook.\n[1965-04-10T10:00:00] Near the church | I remember once, she found out that a funeral was taking place in a church just a few steps away, and she pushed the child over to look. She discovered it was Enzo's mother's funeral. I saw her seeing Enzo, his chest puffed out, his face very pale. I thought of her, but she didn't come over to comfort him, to offer her condolences.\n[1965-04-15T10:00:00] Park | I saw her once more, sitting on a bench with a baby carriage beside her, reading a large book with a green spine. I saw an extremely thin old woman appear in front of her, leaning on a cane, with sunken cheeks that looked as if they had been sucked in.\n[1965-04-15T10:05:00] Park | I had a hard time recognizing Lina, but finally, through her eyes, I suddenly realized that it was Oliviero's stern gaze. I heard, \"Guess who it is.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:06:00] Park | I saw her get excited and stand up, wanting to go over and embrace her, but Teacher Oliviero disdainfully pulled away.\n[1965-04-15T10:07:00] Park | I saw Lina show her the child in the stroller and said proudly, \"His name is Rino.\" I heard her, who had seen everyone praise her child, expecting the teacher to say something nice.\n[1965-04-15T10:08:00] Park | I saw it, but Teacher Oliviero completely ignored the child; she seemed only interested in the thick book the former student was holding. I heard, \"What is this?\" I saw Lina's fingers caught in the page she was looking at.\n[1965-04-15T10:09:00] Park | I saw her remain expressionless and answered impatiently. I thought of Lina and immediately felt uneasy. The teacher's appearance had completely changed, her voice too, but her gaze and that unkind tone remained the same, as if she were still questioning us in class.\n[1965-04-15T10:10:00] Park | I heard \"Ulysses.\" \"Is it about the story from The Odyssey?\" \"No, it's about how low and vulgar our lives have become.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:11:00] Park | \"I heard 'And then?' 'That's it. He said our minds are full of stupid things. We're all made of bones and flesh, we're all pretty much the same, we just think about eating, drinking, and sleeping.'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:12:00] Park | I saw the teacher, as she always did at school, scold her upon hearing the last word; but Lina paid no attention, retorted to her, and she laughed. I heard the teacher was a bit angry and asked her how the book was. She said the book was very difficult and she couldn't fully understand it.\n[1965-04-15T10:13:00] Park | I heard, \"You don't understand it, why are you reading it?\" \"Because there's someone I know who read it, but he didn't like it.\" \"What about you?\" \"I really like it.\" \"Even though it's hard to understand, you still like it?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:14:00] Park | I heard, \"You shouldn't read books you don't understand—they're not good for you, only bad.\" \"There are a lot of things that are harmful.\" \"Are you unhappy?\" \"Not really.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:15:00] Park | \"I heard, 'You're destined to do great things.' 'I already did: I got married and had a son.' 'Everyone can do that.' 'I'm the same as everyone else.'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:16:00] Park | I heard, \"You're wrong.\" \"No, you're the one who's mistaken, you've always been mistaken.\" \"You didn't discipline me when I was a child, and you still haven't disciplined me now.\" \"That shows you never taught me properly.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:17:00] Park | I saw Professor Oliviero looking closely at Lina, and Lina saw anxiety on her face. I thought the teacher was trying to find the cleverness of her childhood in her eyes, wanting to be sure she hadn't made a mistake in her judgment.\n[1965-04-15T10:18:00] Park | I thought that at this moment, Lina was thinking: I want to wipe away all the traces from my face that might make her think I did nothing wrong. I don't want to hear her say that I'm a pity, that I've wasted my talent.\n[1965-04-15T10:19:00] Park | I knew she would realize I was an idiot—these thoughts raced through my mind as I felt my heart pounding. I thought, but at the same time, she felt as if she were facing an exam. Her heart was full of conflict, and she was waiting for the results.\n[1965-04-15T10:20:00] Park | I thought she would see that my whole family is foolish, that my ancestors were all stupid, and that our descendants would be the same. Even little Rino would be an idiot.\n[1965-04-15T10:21:00] Park | I felt a bit angry when I saw her. She put the book in her bag, grabbed the shopping cart handle, and muttered under her breath that she was leaving. I thought of this old madwoman! She thought she could boss others around.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:00] Park | I saw her leave the old woman alone in the small garden. I saw the teacher so frail, her hand gripping the handle of her cane. She was seriously ill, but she still insisted on standing firm.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:10] Home | I saw her beginning to take great interest in developing the child's intelligence.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:15] At home | I saw she didn't know what book to buy, so I sent Alfonso Carracci to ask the bookstore staff.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:20] Home | I saw Alfonso Carracci bring her several books, and she studied them very carefully, taking notes as she went. I saw in her notes that she had made reading notes, and how to read those more difficult books.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:25] Home | I saw her reading each page very carefully, but after a short while, she would lose track of what was on the page and start thinking about something else.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:30] Home | I saw it, but her fingers still mechanically turned the pages, forcing herself to read line by line. I thought that even though she didn't fully understand, she still felt those words had entered her mind and given her some ideas.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:35] Home | I saw that, and then she would reread the book, correcting her thoughts as she read, or expanding them, until she no longer needed the book and went in search of another.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:40] Home | I know the scene her husband often sees when he comes home at night: she hasn't cooked yet, and is letting the children play games she has designed herself.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:45] Home | Every time he saw these, he would get very angry. I thought of her, but she had already become accustomed to not reacting, as if she couldn't hear him, as if only she and the child were in the house.\n[1965-04-15T10:22:50] Home | I saw her finally get up to make breakfast. I thought it wasn't because Stefano was hungry, but because she herself was.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:00] Home | I know that it was during those months, after long periods of mutual tolerance, that their relationship grew increasingly worse.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:05] Home | I saw that one night, Stefano finally shouted at her. I heard him say he was tired, tired of her, the child, and everything.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:10] Home | I once heard him say that when he got married, he was too young to know what he was doing.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:15] Home | I saw but when she answered, . I heard, \"I don't even know why I'm still here, I should take the child and leave.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:23:20] Home | I saw that, and he didn't shout at her, \"Get out!\" He had lost his patience and hit her in front of the child.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:25] Home | I saw him cover her with a quilt and press her to the floor, beating her so that the sound wouldn't be too loud.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:30] Home | I saw Stefano still cursing her. I saw Lina's nose bleeding.\n[1965-04-15T10:23:35] Home | I saw Lina still smiling as she spoke to her son—in Italian, as she always did. I heard, \"Dad's playing, we're having a great time.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:24:00] Lina's House | I saw that she later also began to take care of and educate her nephew Fernando, whom everyone called Dino. I thought to myself that I didn't know why.\n[1965-04-15T10:24:05] Lina's house | I thought it was highly likely that everything stemmed from her need to compare little Rino with another child.\n[1965-04-15T10:24:10] Lina's house | I thought maybe it wasn't like that, perhaps she felt that now she was fully devoted to taking care of her own son, and she also felt obligated to take care of her nephew.\n[1965-04-15T10:24:15] Rino's house | I saw her always shouting at the child, and sometimes even hitting him. I still think of Pinocchio, and I see Rino as a living example of her failed, miserable life.\n[1965-04-15T10:24:20] Rino's house | \"I heard, 'Are you done yet? What do you want me to do, have a mental breakdown?'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:24:25] Rino's house | I saw her firmly opposing Lina for bringing Dino home to play those strange games with little Rino.\n[1965-04-15T10:24:30] Rino's house | I heard her say, furious: \"Watch your son, I'll watch mine. If you have time, take care of your husband, or you'll lose him.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:24:35] Rino's house | I saw it, but at that moment Rino intervened.",

    "text": "[1965-04-15T10:25:00] Mergellina | I know that for Lina's brother, it was a very difficult time—he kept arguing with his father because his father wanted to shut down the shoe workshop.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:05] Mergellina | I thought about how he felt tired of working so hard every day, just to make the Solara family richer, and he didn't understand why he should keep going. He missed his old shoe repair shop.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:10] Mergellina | I saw Rino constantly arguing with Marcello and Michele. I know, but they treat Rino like a rude and unreasonable child. When it comes to money matters, they go straight to Stefano.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:15] Mergellina | When I saw Elena arguing with Stefano, Rino cursed especially harshly. I knew because his brother-in-law no longer gave him a single penny.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:20] Mergellina | I thought that he believed Stefano had already made a secret agreement with the Solara brothers, preparing to hand over all the shoe business to them.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:25] Rino's house | I saw him arguing with Pinocchio. I heard Pinocchio say that he had deceived himself, making her think he was a great man, but in reality, everyone treated him like a monkey.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:30] Rino's house | I heard, \"He's someone anyone—his father, Stefano, Marcello, or Michele—could manipulate.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:25:35] Rino's house | I saw Rino starting to interfere; he personally took the child to his sister. I thought, but when he saw that Lina, absorbed in her son, neglected her husband, Stefano was upset. Pinocchia didn't want to entrust her child to Lina, not even for an hour.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:40] Lina's house | I saw that he had developed a habit of spending several hours in the new house of Lina, watching Lina and little Rino, as well as Dino play. I knew the work in the shoemaker's shop was getting less and less.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:45] Lina's house | I was surprised by Lina's patience as a mother and her ability to play with children.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:50] Lina's house | I know, especially his son, who either cried nonstop in his own home or sat in the child's playpen like a sad little animal.\n[1965-04-15T10:25:55] Lina's house | I saw it, but in Lina's case, I saw him become agile, looking clever and happy.\n[1965-04-15T10:26:00] Lina's house | \"I heard him ask, 'How did you manage it?' with respect.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:05] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'I let them play.'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:10] Lina's house | I heard, \"My son played too.\" \"Here, they play and learn at the same time.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:15] Lina's house | I heard the question, \"Why do you spend so much time on this?\" \"Because I read somewhere that in the first few years of life, this stage determines what kind of person we will become.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:20] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'Is my child okay?' 'Look for yourself.'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:25] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'Yes, I saw, she's more capable than yours.' 'My child is a bit younger.'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:30] Lina's house | I heard, \"Do you think Dino is smart?\" \"All children are smart if you train them.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:26:35] Lina's house | I heard, \"Lina, you train him. Don't be like usual, giving up after a few minutes. You have to raise him into a very smart child.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:27:00] Lina's house | I saw one evening that Stefano came home early. I saw that he was more anxious than usual.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:05] Lina's house | I saw him sitting on the kitchen floor, the house was in a mess, and my wife didn't care about him—she only took care of the child.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:10] Lina's house | I saw him, but instead of making his usual face, he said something to Rino. I heard, \"This is my house, and I'm not at all happy watching you waste your time like this every day.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:27:15] Lina's house | I heard, \"The business of the shoe workshop is getting worse and worse, and that's exactly because you never want to work hard all day.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:27:20] Lina's House | I heard, \"The people from Lina's family are unreliable. Either you leave right now, or I'll kick your ass.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:27:25] Lina's house | I saw that a fierce battle immediately broke out, Lina shouted. I heard, \"You shouldn't talk to your brother like that!\"\n[1965-04-15T10:27:30] Lina's House | I saw Rino finally shouting out the words he had previously held back out of caution, or else left unclear.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:35] Lina's house | I saw them cursing each other, saying all sorts of harsh words.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:40] Lina's house | I saw that in the midst of this chaos, I heard two children crying and shouting, pulling on their toys, especially the older one bullying the younger one.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:45] Lina's house | I saw Rino shouting at Stefano. I saw his face turn red, his neck swollen, and his veins bulging like wires.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:50] Lina's house | I heard him say that Stefano was using the money extorted by Don Achille from the person in Mergellina to live extravagantly.\n[1965-04-15T10:27:55] Lina's house | I heard him say next: \"You're nothing, you're just a pile of dog shit. At least your father could be a thug, but you can't even be a thug.\"\n[1965-04-15T10:28:00] Lina's house | I couldn't stop thinking about that moment—it was too terrifying, Lina was completely frozen with fear.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:05] Lina's house | I saw suddenly, Stefano grabbed Rino by the waist with both hands, like a traditional ballet dancer lifting his partner.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:10] Lina's house | Even though Stefano and Rino were about the same size, even though Rino was struggling, shouting, and spitting at that moment, Stefano still lifted him up and threw him against a wall.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:15] Lina's house | I saw him quickly grab one of Rino's arms and drag him toward the door.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:20] Lina's house | I saw that even though Rino was resisting, even though Lina ran over and embraced him, begging him to calm down, nothing helped.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:25] Lina's house | I saw Stefano open the door, pull him up, and kick him down the stairs.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:30] Lina's House | I saw that the matter wasn't over, and Stefano came back in a rage. I thought that Lina understood that Dino would also suffer the same fate as his father—being thrown down the stairs.\n[1965-04-15T10:28:35] Lina's house | I saw her rush over immediately, throw herself at him from behind, claw at his face, and shout. \"I heard, 'He's still a child, Strega! He's still a child.'\"\n[1965-04-15T10:28:40] Lina's house | I saw Stefano stop. I heard him say, word for word: \"I can't take it anymore, I fucking can't take it anymore.\"\n[1965-04-20T09:00:00] Mergellina | I knew a very complicated period had begun—Rino no longer went to his sister's house. I thought, but Lina didn't want to give up.\n[1965-04-20T09:00:10] Rino's house | I saw that she wanted the child to play with Dino, and she had developed the habit of secretly going to her brother's house, hiding it from Stefano.\n[1965-04-20T09:00:20] Rino's house | I saw it start, and Lina tried to explain her idea to her: reaction exercises, training games. Finally, she said she even wanted all the children from Mergellina to join in. I saw Pinocchio frowning, her face full of displeasure.\n[1965-04-20T09:00:30] Rino's house | I heard But Pinochcia simply replied to her, \"You're crazy. I don't care what embarrassing thing you do.\"\n[1965-04-20T09:00:40] Rino's house | I heard, \"You want my child to be with you? You want to kill him? You want to eat him like a witch? Do whatever you want, I don't want this child at all, I never wanted him in the first place.\"\n[1965-04-20T09:00:45] Rino's house | I heard, \"You destroyed my life, you ruined my brother's life.\"\n[1965-04-20T09:00:50] Rino's house | I saw it, then she shouted at Lina. I heard, \"That poor man gave you a green hat; he deserved it.\"\n[1965-04-20T09:00:55] Rino's house | I saw that Lina didn't react.\n[1965-04-20T09:01:00] Rino's house | I didn't ask what the last thing Pinocchio said meant; she just made an instinctive gesture, like swatting a fly.\n[1965-04-20T09:01:05] Rino's house | I saw her walking away with the child in her arms. I thought that although she felt she could no longer meet her nephew, it was a pity, but she didn't come back.",

    "text": "[1965-04-20T21:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her alone in that apartment. I felt scared when I thought of her.\n[1965-04-20T21:05:00] Lina's House | I thought she didn't care at all whether Stefano was spending money on prostitutes, on the contrary, she was happy, but by nightfall she could not tolerate him no matter what.\n[1965-04-20T21:10:00] Lina's house | I thought, but after this stage, Lina began to worry about the child: if her husband had another woman outside, if that woman wanted to possess him all the time, he might have [mental health issues], and might drive her away.\n[1965-04-20T21:15:00] Lina's house | I thought that until that moment, ending the marriage had been a complete liberation for her, but now she was worried about losing this house, her free time, and the conditions for her children to grow up properly.\n[1965-04-20T21:20:00] Lina's house | I saw that she started having trouble sleeping at night. I thought Lina was very anxious.\n[1965-04-20T21:25:00] Lina's house | I thought that maybe Stefano's anger was not just a sign of his imbalance; his poor lineage had made him break through the usual polite facade.\n[1965-04-20T21:30:00] Lina's house | I thought maybe he really had fallen in love with another woman, just like what happened between her and Nino. Now he couldn't stand the cage of marriage, couldn't stand being a father, not even the Capodimonte and other business matters.\n[1965-04-20T21:35:00] Lina's house | I thought about the moment when Pinocchio said that line, and after that Lina began to think about the question over and over again, but she didn't know what to do.\n[1965-04-20T21:40:00] Lina's house | I saw her, but she kept delaying, letting things take their course, hoping that Stefano would enjoy his mistress without disturbing her. I thought to myself that she should make a decision, face this issue, and resolve it.\n[1965-04-20T21:45:00] Lina's house | I thought to myself that in the end, she thought that if she just endured for another one or two years, and when the child grew a bit older, she wouldn't have to worry about this anymore.\n[1965-04-21T18:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her start rearranging her schedule. When Stefano came home, she always had the house spotless, dinner ready, and the table set.\n[1965-04-21T18:05:00] Lina's house | I saw him always frowning, always full of worry. I know, but ever since Stefano and Rino had that fight, he never returned to his former gentle self.\n[1965-04-21T18:10:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Is there a problem?\" \"The money problem.\"\n[1965-04-21T18:15:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano angry. I heard, \"Only matters of money? What does 'only' mean?\"\n[1965-04-21T18:20:00] Lina's House | I thought that for him, besides money, there were no other problems in life.\n[1965-04-21T19:00:00] Lina's house | I saw him finish dinner and then start calculating the bill, muttering curses while he did so. I heard, \"The arrival of the new Capodimonte is nowhere near as good as before.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:05:00] Lina's House | I heard them say that the Solara brothers, especially Michele, acted as if those shoes were all theirs and they no longer needed to share the profits.\n[1965-04-21T19:10:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"The Solara brothers didn't tell us, but they had some old styles of the 'Lina' brand made by the shoemakers in the suburbs for very little money.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:15:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"They've designed some new 'Sorola' models, but they're really just slight variations based on Lina's designs.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:20:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"In that case, the shoemaker's shop will really go out of business. All the money I invested in it will be wasted.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:25:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Do you understand?\" \"I see.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:30:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Then you'd better stop picking on me.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:35:00] Lina's house | I thought that Lina didn't believe everything her husband said; she felt he was exaggerating, trying to cover up new troubles, hiding his growing hostility toward her, and masking his increasingly severe mental imbalance.\n[1965-04-21T19:40:00] Lina's house | I saw him blaming Lina for all the mistakes, especially the deterioration of his relationship with Solara.\n[1965-04-21T19:45:00] Lina's house | I saw once when he shouted at her. I heard, \"What did you do to that bastard Michele? Can I know?\"\n[1965-04-21T19:50:00] Lina's house | I heard her answer, \"Nothing.\"\n[1965-04-21T19:55:00] Lina's house | I heard him say, \"It's not nothing. Every time we discuss the issue, he brings you up and doesn't even listen to what I'm saying. You should talk to him and find out what he wants.\"\n[1965-04-21T20:00:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"If you don't go, I'll tear your face apart.\"\n[1965-04-21T20:05:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina almost say it before she could stop herself. I heard, \"If he wants to sleep with me, what should I do? Let him?\"\n[1965-04-21T20:10:00] Lina's house | I thought she would soon regret what she'd said—sometimes, contempt got the better of her, and she couldn't help but be careless, but the words were already out.\n[1965-04-21T20:15:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano slap her, but the slap wasn't hard, unlike his usual way of slapping her with his whole hand. This time, he only used his fingertips.\n[1965-04-21T20:20:00] Lina's house | I saw him, but what he said next was extremely cruel; he spoke with a face full of disgust. I heard, \"You read and study, but you're still so rude. I can't stand a woman like you. You make me feel sick.\"\n[1965-05-01T20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that on Sundays, he didn't sleep until noon like usual, but left early and disappeared all day. I knew that from then on, he started coming home later and later.\n[1965-05-15T10:00:00] Lina's house | When she even slightly mentioned some specific issues in family life, he would get angry.\n[1965-05-15T10:05:00] Lina's house | I saw, for example, that when the weather got hot, she wanted to take the kids to the beach, so she asked her husband to arrange it.\n[1965-05-15T10:10:00] Lina's house | I heard him answer, \"Take the bus to the seaside in Torre Cava.\"\n[1965-05-15T10:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her gather the courage to speak. I heard, \"Wouldn't it be better to rent a house by the sea?\"\n[1965-05-15T10:20:00] Lina's house | I heard him reply, \"Why? Does renting a house make you a prostitute from morning till night?\"\n[1965-05-15T10:25:00] Lina's house | I saw him leave, and he didn't come back that night.\n[1965-05-20T11:00:00] Downtown | I saw Lina go downtown with the child, looking for a book she had read about, but she couldn't find it. I knew it wouldn't be long before things became clear.\n[1965-05-20T11:15:00] Martiri Square | I saw her walking, continuing all the way to Martiri Square, where she wanted to ask Alfonso Carracci something.\n[1965-05-20T11:20:00] Shoe Store | I saw Lina trying to get him to help her find the book. I know he's still working as a manager in the shoe store on Martiri Square, and he's very satisfied with his job.\n[1965-05-20T11:25:00] Shoe Store | I saw her meet a very handsome young man, well-dressed, one of the most handsome guys she'd ever seen. His name was Fabrizio. I knew he wasn't a customer, but a friend of Alfonso Carracci.\n[1965-05-20T11:30:00] Shoe Store | I saw Lina talking with him for a while, and I realized he knew a lot. They talked for a long time about literature, the history of San Gregorio Armeno, and how to educate children.\n[1965-05-20T11:35:00] Shoe Store | I saw Alfonso Carracci silently listening to them talk, and when the child started whining, he immediately went to comfort him. I know that Fabrizio works at the university and is very familiar with this subject.\n[1965-05-20T11:40:00] Shoe Store | I saw later that a customer came, and Alfonso Carracci went to greet him.\n[1965-05-20T11:45:00] Shoe Store | I saw Lina and Fabrizio talk for a while longer. I thought she hadn't had a real conversation with someone in a long time, and she felt many thoughts were being stirred up.\n[1965-05-20T11:50:00] Shoe Store | I saw that when the young man was leaving, he gave her a tender kiss on the cheek, and he also kissed Alfonso Carracci, two loud kisses.\n[1965-05-20T11:55:00] Shoe Store | I heard him shouting at the door, \"It's been a real pleasure talking to you!\" \"Me too,\" she said.\n[1965-05-20T12:00:00] Shoe Store | I saw Lina's face grow dark, and Alfonso Carracci was still serving customers. I thought of her, of the people she had met in this place, of Nino.\n[1965-05-20T12:05:00] Shoe Store | I know that Nino always slips here at one o'clock, and after their secret meeting, he disappears at four. I thought of the rolling shutter being pulled down, of their gentle conversation in the darkness.\n[1965-05-20T12:10:00] Shoe Store | I saw her look around uncomfortably. I thought it was so strange that she considered it something imagined.\n[1965-05-20T12:15:00] Shoe Store | I thought she didn't miss those days, didn't miss Nino. She just felt that time had passed, and things that once seemed important were no longer so.\n[1965-05-20T12:20:00] Shoe Store | I saw her pushing the child as she was about to leave, when Michele came in. I thought her mind was a tangle of confusion, but she didn't want to untangle it.\n[1965-05-20T12:25:00] Shoe Store | I saw him greet Lina warmly and play with the child. I heard him say that little Rino looked exactly like Lina.\n[1965-05-20T12:30:00] Shoe Store | I saw him ask Lina for a coffee at the cafeteria, and finally decided to take her home.\n[1965-05-20T12:35:00] In Michele's car | I saw them get in, and then he said. I heard, \"Leave your husband, leave right away. I can bring you and your son here today.\"\n[1965-05-20T12:40:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"I bought an apartment in the Piazza del Plebiscito district, right near the Artist's Square. If you're willing, I can show it to you right away. When I bought it, I thought of you.\"\n[1965-05-20T12:45:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"Here, you can do anything you want: read, write, invent something, sleep, talk, laugh. You're with your child. I just want to watch you, listen to you, hear you laugh.\"\n[1965-05-20T12:50:00] In Michele's car | I saw him driving, casting uneasy glances at her, trying to gauge her reaction. I knew that Michele didn't speak in that mocking tone the first time.\n[1965-05-20T12:55:00] In Michele's car | I saw that all the way, Lina kept staring at the road in front of her, trying to pull the pacifier out of little Rino's mouth. I thought she was keeping the pacifier in his mouth too long, but the child was pushing her hand away all along.\n[1965-05-20T13:00:00] In Michele's car | I saw that she never interrupted Michele's words until Michele fell silent, and then she asked. I heard, \"You're done?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:05:00] In Michele's car | \"I heard 'Where is Giyaolao?' 'What does Giyaolao have to do with this? Tell me, are you willing or not, and then we'll see.'\"\n[1965-05-20T13:10:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"No, Michele, my answer is no! I don't want your brother, and I don't want you either.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:15:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"First of all, I don't like you or your brother; second, because you always think you can get anything without any consideration, and you have no respect for people.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:20:00] In Michele's car | I saw Michele didn't react right away; he muttered something about a pacifier. I heard, \"Give it to him, don't let him cry.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:25:00] In Michele's car | I saw and then he said with a dark expression. I heard, \"Think it over, Lina. Maybe tomorrow you'll regret it and come begging me.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:30:00] In Michele's car | \"I didn't think so.\" \"Oh, really? Then listen to me.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:35:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"Your mother, your father, and your damn brother know, but they say nothing, just to live a quiet life.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:40:00] In Michele's car | I heard that \"Stefano has been having an affair with Pinocchia for a long time, it started even before you went on vacation to Vomero.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:45:00] In Michele's car | I saw him say to Lina. I heard, \"You're on vacation outside, and she goes to your house every night.\"\n[1965-05-20T13:50:00] In Michele's car | I heard that after Lina came back, the two of them were quiet for a while, but later they couldn't resist starting again, even breaking up once in between. During the time Lina disappeared from Mergellina, they got back together again.\n[1965-05-20T13:55:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"Recently, Stefano rented a house in the Rettifilo district, and they meet there.\"\n[1965-05-20T14:00:00] In Michele's car | I heard, \"Do you believe what I'm saying?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1965-05-20T14:05:00] In Michele's car | What did I think then? Her husband had a lover, and that lover was Pinocchia, and it didn't trouble her at all.\n[1965-05-20T14:10:00] In Michele's car | I thought of it, but what made her feel ridiculous was the words he had said and the actions he had taken when he came to pick her up at Vomero—she recalled the shouting, the physical violence, and the moment she left.\n[1965-05-20T14:15:00] In Michele's car | I saw her say it to Michele. I heard, \"You really make me sick, you, and Stefano, all of you.\"\n[1965-05-20T23:00:00] Lina's house | I thought of Lina and suddenly felt as though I were in the right, which calmed her a bit.",

    "text": "[1965-05-21T02:00:00] Lina's House | That night, I saw her put little Rino to bed and wait for Stefano to come home. He returned in the early hours, and when he saw Lina sitting at the kitchen table.\n[1965-05-21T02:05:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina lift her eyes from the book. I heard her say that she knew about him and Pinocchio, that she knew when they had started, but she didn't care at all.\n[1965-05-21T02:10:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"Whatever you did to me, I'll do to you.\"\n[1965-05-21T02:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her smiling as she spoke slowly and clearly, then repeated it to him—she had already told him a few times, two or three? I heard, \"Little Rino isn't your son.\"\n[1965-05-21T02:20:00] Lina's house | I saw her, and she suddenly cried out. I heard, \"You can do whatever you want, sleep with whoever you want, but the key is—never touch me again.\"\n[1965-05-21T02:25:00] Lina's house | I thought about how I didn't know what was going on in her mind, maybe she just wanted to clear things up, or perhaps she hoped everything would come out into the open.\n[1965-05-21T02:30:00] Lina's house | I thought about how she was waiting for him to explain everything, to beat her hard, to kick her out of the house, or to force her—legally married, serving his lover.\n[1965-05-21T02:35:00] Lina's house | I saw that she was already ready, wearing that arrogant expression. I thought it was like a rich person who can buy anything.\n[1965-05-21T02:40:00] Lina's house | I saw it at that moment, but she didn't hear any explanation. Stefano didn't announce that their marriage had ended; he denied it.\n[1965-05-21T02:45:00] Lina's house | I saw him with a dark expression, speaking calmly. I heard, \"Pinocchio is just a salesperson in Capodimonte, and the rumors spreading outside are unfounded.\"\n[1965-05-21T02:50:00] Lina's house | I saw he was very angry, and he shouted loudly. I heard, \"If you say one more word about my son, I'll kill you.\"\n[1965-05-21T02:55:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Little Rino is exactly like me, identical! Everyone says so, no matter how much you try to blacken his name.\"\n[1965-05-21T03:00:00] Lina's house | I saw him express his love to Lina as he had before, using the same words. I thought about it in the end — that's the most astonishing thing of all.\n[1965-05-21T03:05:00] Lina's house | I heard him say he would always love her because Lina was his wife, because they had married in front of the priest, and nothing could separate them.\n[1965-05-21T03:10:00] Lina's house | I saw that when he came to embrace her, she pushed him away. He grabbed Lina, lifted her up, and took her into the bedroom, where the child's crib was also located.\n[1965-05-21T03:15:00] Lina's house | I saw him tear all her clothes off and force his way into her body.\n[1965-05-21T03:20:00] Lina's house | I saw her suppress her sobs, whispering a plea to him. I heard, \"The child will wake up, will see and hear us. Please, let's go over there.\"\n[1965-06-01T09:00:00] Lina's house | I knew that from that night on, Lina had lost even the little bit of freedom she had left.\n[1965-06-01T09:05:00] Lina's house | I thought about Stefano's behavior, which had become increasingly unreasonable. He seemed to feel even more emboldened now that his wife knew about his relationship with Pinocchia.\n[1965-08-15T10:00:00] Stockholm | I saw that he often stayed out overnight. Every Sunday, he would go out with his lover in the car. That August, he even went on vacation with Pinocchia, driving a sports car all the way to Stockholm.\n[1965-08-15T10:05:00] Mergellina | I heard Pinocchio tell someone she went to Turin, and she had a cousin who worked at the Fiat factory, so she went to find her cousin.\n[1965-09-01T10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that he didn't want his wife to go out, so he had Lina buy things by phone. As I thought about it, a sickening jealousy erupted in Stefano's heart.\n[1965-09-01T10:05:00] Lina's house | I saw that if Lina took the child out for fresh air and stayed outside for more than an hour, he would force her to tell him who she had met and what she had said. He was constantly watching her, more like a husband than ever before.\n[1965-09-01T10:10:00] Lina's house | I thought that he might be afraid that his betrayal of Lina gave her a reason to betray him. The things he did in the Rettifilo district with Pinochia would make him think of the details of Lina's love affair with her lover, even more outrageous than his own actions.\n[1965-09-01T10:15:00] Lina's house | I thought, but on the other hand, he boasted about his success with women, not wanting to look ridiculous because of his wife's infidelity.\n[1965-09-01T10:20:00] Lina's House | I realized that Stefano wasn't jealous of all men; he had an inner hierarchy. Lina quickly understood that he was especially worried about Michele, because Michele constantly overshadowed him. He had fallen into the Solara brothers' trap and had lost all self-respect.\n[1965-09-01T10:25:00] Lina's house | I know that Lina never once mentioned the time Michele had tried to [physically intimate] her, suggesting that she become his lover. I thought, but Stefano had already sensed it.\n[1965-09-01T10:30:00] Lina's house | I thought that he believed Michele wanted to humiliate him, take his wife, which was an important step in ruining him financially.\n[1965-09-01T10:35:00] Lina's house | I thought, but on the other hand, it was precisely this business relationship that made him feel Lina should be a bit more polite to Michele.\n[1965-09-01T10:40:00] Lina's house | I knew that no matter what Lina did, it would be wrong, and she would be blamed by her husband.\n[1965-09-01T10:45:00] Lina's House | I sometimes saw Stefano relentlessly pressing her. I heard, \"Did you see Michele? Did you talk to him? Did he ask you to design new shoes?\"\n[1965-09-01T10:50:00] Lina's house | I sometimes saw him shouting. I heard, \"You see that bastard, you can't even say hello, do you understand?\"\n[1965-09-01T10:55:00] Lina's house | I saw him rummaging through the drawers, trying to find evidence of her infidelity.\n[1965-09-01T11:00:00] Mergellina | I knew her situation had become even more difficult, first because of Pasquale's interference, and later because of Rino.\n[1965-09-01T11:05:00] Mergellina | I knew that Pasquale was naturally the last to find out, even after Lina: his girlfriend was Stefano's mistress.\n[1965-09-01T11:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that no one told him, he had seen it with his own eyes.\n[1965-09-05T14:00:00] Rettifilo District | I saw, on a Sunday afternoon in September, he saw Stefano and Pinocchia coming out of the front door of a house in the Rettifilo district, arm in arm.\n[1965-09-05T14:05:00] Rettifilo District | I knew that Pinocchio had told him earlier that she needed to go with her mother Melina to take care of something, so she couldn't meet him.\n[1965-09-05T14:10:00] District of Rettifilo | I knew he was always out there, either working or involved in political activities, and I didn't pay much attention to his girlfriend's excuses.\n[1965-09-05T14:15:00] Rettifilo District | I thought about how he would feel when he saw them coming out together, and it would cause him a terrible pain, his heart full of conflicting emotions.\n[1965-09-05T14:20:00] Rettifilo District | My first thought was to rush over and kill this pair of adulterers, but as a communist agent, the training he had received prevented him from doing so.\n[1965-09-05T14:25:00] Rettifilo District | I know that in recent times, Pasquale has become the branch secretary of the Mergellin aCommunist Party.\n[1965-09-05T14:30:00] Rettifilo District | I know that in the past, he would have regarded us all as floating, faithless prostitutes, just like the boys who grew up with us.\n[1965-09-05T14:35:00] Rettifilo District | I saw that now he, through his studies, was reading the \"Unification Newspaper\" and some brochures, and leading discussions with everyone. I thought he realized he couldn't do it anymore.\n[1965-09-05T14:40:00] Rettifilo District | I thought the opposite: he tried hard to convince himself that we women were not inferior to men, that we also had our own feelings, our own thoughts, and our own freedom.\n[1965-09-05T14:45:00] District of Rettifilo | I thought about how caught between anger and principle, his inner self was very confused.",

    "text": "[1965-09-06T20:00:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw that he didn't change his work clothes the next evening and ran off to see Pinocchia in a dirty state. I heard that he already knows.\n[1965-09-06T20:05:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw her suddenly relax, admit what she'd done, she cried and begged for his forgiveness.\n[1965-09-06T20:10:00] Elena's House | I heard him ask if Pinocchio did this for money. She said she loved Stefano, that only she knew he was a good man, generous and respectful.\n[1965-09-06T20:15:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw the end result was that Pasquale smashed his fist into the kitchen wall of Antonio's house and went home crying, his knuckles aching badly.\n[1965-09-06T22:00:00] Pasquale's house | After I saw it, he spent the whole night talking to his sister Pinocchia. I thought they were both suffering, sharing the same pain—one because of Pinocchio, the other because of Enzo, and Pinocchio couldn't forget him.\n[1965-09-07T09:00:00] Mergellina | I thought the situation had indeed become very bad. Although Pasquale had been betrayed, he decided to defend Pinochietta and Lina's dignity.\n[1965-09-07T10:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw him go to Stefano first, and he said a long string of things to him politely, the main idea being that Stefano should leave his wife and elevate his mistress Pinocchia.\n[1965-09-07T14:00:00] Lina's house | I saw and then he went to find Lina, saying that she couldn't let Stefano trample on her rights as a wife and her feelings as a woman.\n[1965-09-08T06:30:00] At Pasquale's front door | I remember one morning—six thirty in the morning—when Stefano came to see him before he left for work. He was in a good mood and wanted to give Pasquale some money.\n[1965-09-08T06:35:00] At Pasquale's front door | I heard him being told to stop meddling with him, his wife, and Pinocchio.\n[1965-09-08T06:40:00] At Pasquale's front door | I saw Pasquale take the money, count it, and then scatter it into the air. I heard, \"I've been working since I was a child; I don't need your money.\"\n[1965-09-08T06:45:00] At Pasquale's front door | I saw it and then, as if apologizing for not being able to keep up, he said he had to leave. I heard, \"If I'm late for work, I'll get fired.\"\n[1965-09-08T06:50:00] At Pasquale's front door | I saw that Pasquale had already walked quite a distance, and then he seemed to remember something, so he turned back and called out to Stefano, who was bent over picking up money on the ground.\n[1965-09-08T06:55:00] At Pasquale's front door | I heard, \"You're even worse than that pig of your father's Fascist!\"\n[1965-09-08T07:00:00] At Pasquale's front door | I saw them start fighting immediately.\n[1965-09-08T07:05:00] At Pasquale's front door | I saw that it was a very frightening scene. I thought that if no one had pulled them apart, someone would have been killed.\n[1965-09-10T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that Rino had also started causing trouble. I thought about how he couldn't accept that his sister no longer educated his son Dino, turning him into a smart child.\n[1965-09-10T10:05:00] Mergellina | I thought about how he would never accept that his brother-in-law no longer gave him a single penny, and even hit him.\n[1965-09-10T10:10:00] Mergellina | I thought about how he couldn't accept Stefano and Pinocchia openly being together, humiliating Lina.\n[1965-09-10T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw his actions were unexpected; when he saw Stefano hit Lina, he also started hitting Pinocchia.\n[1965-09-10T10:20:00] Mergellina | I saw that he saw that Stefano had a lover, and he also found a lover.\n[1965-09-10T10:25:00] Mergellina | I know that in any case, how Stefano treated his sister, that's how he treated his sister.\n[1965-09-10T10:30:00] Rino's house | I saw this putting Pinocchio in an impossible situation: she cried and cried, begged and begged, pleading with Rino not to act that way, but it was no use.\n[1965-09-10T10:35:00] Rino's house | I thought that Rino made his mother Nunzia also afraid.\n[1965-09-10T10:40:00] Rino's house | I saw that as soon as Pinocchio opened her mouth, Rino would lose his temper and start shouting.\n[1965-09-10T10:45:00] Rino's house | \"I heard, 'I can't do this? I need to calm down? Then go find your brother, have him leave Pinocchio, have him respect Lina. We should be a united family. He and Solara should give me the money they owe me, both past and present.\"\n[1965-09-10T11:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw that Pinocchio often ran out of the house with messy hair to go find her brother at Capodimonte, crying in front of Pinocchio and the customers.\n[1965-09-10T11:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw Stefano pull her to the back of the shop. Pinocchia listed her husband's demands, but in the end, she said.\n[1965-09-10T11:10:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"Don't give that bastard anything, go to my house right away and kill him.\"\n[1966-02-20T10:00:00] Porto | I know that when I returned to San Gregorio Armeno for the carnival, the situation was basically like this: I had already been living in Borgo for two and a half years, and I was an outstanding student. I realized that going back to Mask for the holiday had become a burden for me. I went home only to avoid conflicts with my parents, especially with my mother.\n[1966-02-20T10:05:00] Train | I felt anxious the moment the train entered San Gregorio Armeno. I thought about the unexpected things that might happen, preventing me from returning to Borgo Normal School by the end of the holiday—like getting seriously ill and having to be hospitalized, or some other terrible event forcing me to drop out of school because Posillipo family needed me.\n[1966-02-20T12:00:00] Porto | I saw that less than a few hours after I got home, my mother had already mercilessly told me all the messy things that had happened to Lina, Stefano, Pinocchia, Pasquale, and Rino. I heard her mention that the shoemaker's shop was about to close, how they had once been so rich, looking down their nose at everyone, buying a sports car the first year, then having to sell everything just to pay off the usury loan they owed to Mrs. Solara, and could no longer act so arrogant.\n[1966-02-20T12:05:00] Porto | I saw that in the gaps while she was talking endlessly, she would stop and say to me. I heard, \"Your friend Lina had forgotten who she was back then, but when she got married, she acted like a princess, with a big car, a new house, but you're much better, much more beautiful than her.\"\n[1966-02-20T12:10:00] Porto | When she said that, she made a proud expression, as if unable to contain her feelings, then handed me a note. She had obviously already read it, even though the note was meant for me. I knew Lina wanted to see me; she invited me to have lunch at her house the next day, which was Friday.\n[1966-02-20T14:00:00] Courtyard | I saw that not long after, Pasquale was calling me in the courtyard. I knew it wasn't just Lina who had invited me; in fact, I was really busy those days. I thought of myself as if I had descended from the sacred Mount Olympus, not emerged from my parents' dark and dilapidated house.\n[1966-02-20T14:10:00] Courtyard | I saw him trying to express his views on women, the pain he had suffered, and he wanted to know what I thought of him.\n[1966-02-20T20:00:00] Porto | I saw the same thing that night: Pinochia vented her anger at Rino and Lina on me as well.\n[1966-02-21T09:00:00] Courtyard | I saw that the next morning, Pinocchio also confided in me her sense of guilt and her full heart of resentment. I thought what surprised me was.\n[1966-02-21T09:10:00] Courtyard | I spoke to them in a calm and controlled tone. I heard myself telling Pasquale that he should stay calm; I told Pinochcia that she should take care of her own child first; I told Pinochcia that she should figure out if it was real love.\n[1966-02-21T09:15:00] Courtyard | When she spoke to me, I looked at her as if she were a book. She was Melina—the daughter of the mad widow, the sister of Antonio, and on her face I could see traces of her mother and the likeness of her brother. I thought that although I felt what I was saying was shallow, I still had to say it, and Pinocchia's performance especially intrigued me.\n[1966-02-21T09:20:00] Courtyard | I know she never had a father since childhood, and she had to face all kinds of dangers. She was used to hardship. She worked as a cleaner in our building, and she and Melina had washed the stairs for many years. Melina often fell ill.\n[1966-02-21T09:25:00] Courtyard | I knew the Solara brothers had taken her to the car when she was very young. I thought about what they might have done to her, and I felt it was natural for her to fall in love with Stefano; Stefano was a rather refined boss.\n[1966-02-21T09:30:00] Courtyard | I saw her say that she loved him, that they were very much in love. I heard her say, \"Please tell Lina,\" her eyes filled with passionate light. \"Feelings can't be controlled. If Lina were his wife, I would be the woman who's already given everything for Stefano, and would give everything for him again.\"\n[1966-02-21T09:35:00] Courtyard | I heard, \"All the emotions and attention a man could want, I can give him. We'll soon have a child, so he belongs to me now, no longer to her.\"\n[1966-02-21T09:40:00] Courtyard | I thought to myself, I understand. She will get everything she can possibly get: Stefano, Capodimonte, money, a house, a car. The war she has to face is one almost everyone has to face.\n[1966-02-21T09:45:00] Courtyard | I saw myself trying to calm her down. I saw that moment, I saw her face very pale, her eyes red and swollen.\n[1966-02-21T09:50:00] Courtyard | I saw myself offering her suggestions in elegant Italian, which left Pasquale, Pinochia, and her somewhat confused. I felt happy thinking about how she regarded me as a god, and I was grateful for that.\n[1966-02-21T09:55:00] Courtyard | I thought with a touch of self-mockery, this is what the history exam, classical literature, pedagogy, and the thousands of reading cards I trained myself to make were all for: to keep them calm for a few hours.\n[1966-02-21T10:00:00] Courtyard | I thought they saw me as lofty and impartial, and that those extreme emotions and thoughts had been elevated through study.\n[1966-02-21T10:05:00] Courtyard | I thought about how I had accepted the role they gave me, but I never mentioned my inner anxieties or my reckless behavior.\n[1966-02-21T10:10:00] Courtyard | I know, for example, when Borgo happened, I took a big risk by letting Franco Mari slip into my room, or me slipping into his, and we spent our vacation in Vescia alone, living together like a married couple. I thought I even felt proud of myself.",

    "text": "[1966-02-21T12:00:00] At Lina's front door | I felt a sense of unease as lunchtime approached, and I reluctantly went to Lina's house.\n[1966-02-21T12:05:00] Lina's house | I thought I was worried, and she could instantly restore everything to how it was before, making me lose my confidence and making me feel that my choices were all wrong.\n[1966-02-21T12:10:00] Lina's house | I thought about how scared I was, afraid that she would point out Nino's features in little Rino, afraid that she would remind me: that toy which had once belonged to me had been destined to become hers.\n[1966-02-21T12:15:00] Lina's House | I saw that it was a very beautiful child, with chestnut hair. There was no trace of Nino on his face or body; he looked just like Lina, even like Stefano, as if they had all three created him together. I thought that wasn't how it had happened, but her son immediately made me soften.\n[1966-02-21T12:20:00] Lina's house | When she saw me, her eyes filled with tears and her whole body started shaking. I had to hold her tightly to calm her down. I saw that Lina seemed weaker than ever before.\n[1966-02-21T12:25:00] Lina's House | I saw her realize that she didn't want to embarrass herself in front of me, so she quickly did her hair and hastily applied some lipstick. I saw her in a pearl-gray dress, the one she bought for her engagement, and she was wearing high-heeled shoes.\n[1966-02-21T12:30:00] Lina's House | She was still beautiful, but it looked as if the bones on her face had grown larger, her eyes smaller, and instead of blood flowing beneath her skin, there was some dark liquid.\n[1966-02-21T12:35:00] Lina's house | I saw that she was very thin, and when I hugged her, I could only feel her bones. The tight dress made her swollen stomach very noticeable.\n[1966-02-21T12:40:00] Lina's house | I saw it start, and she pretended everything was fine. I thought about how my enthusiasm for the child made her happy. She liked it when I played with the kids, and she wanted to show me what her son could say and do.\n[1966-02-21T12:45:00] Lina's house | I saw her anxiously explaining to me the child-rearing methods she had read about in a book. She told me about names I had never heard of before, and she forced her son to do the exercises she had designed. I saw that it was an urgency I had never seen in her before.\n[1966-02-21T12:50:00] Lina's house | I saw that she now had a nervous reaction, a facial expression around her mouth: suddenly opening her mouth and then pressing her lips tightly together, as if trying to control her emotions. I saw that this expression was usually accompanied by red eyes and a tightening of the lips, as if a natural reaction, suppressing everything and keeping it deep within the mind.\n[1966-02-21T12:55:00] Lina's house | I heard her say several times: If this method could be applied to all the children in Mergellina, the next generation would be completely different. There would be no good children or bad children, no difference between capable and incapable ones.\n[1966-02-21T13:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her looking at the child and suddenly started crying. She showed me those books that had been torn in half. I heard her say, \"He tore my book,\" crying as if it were a child who had done it.\n[1966-02-21T13:05:00] Lina's house | I saw her muttering to herself. I heard, \"He's developed the habit of going through my things. He doesn't want me to have any thoughts of my own. If he finds anything I'm hiding, even something completely insignificant, he'll hit me.\" I later figured out that the book wasn't torn by a child, but by her husband.\n[1966-02-21T13:10:00] Lina's house | I saw that at this moment, she took a metal box from the top of the bedroom closet and handed it to me. I heard, \"These books record everything about me and Nino, my thoughts in my head, and some things we've never talked about these past years.\"\n[1966-02-21T13:15:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Take these notebooks with you, I'm scared he might find them, see what's written in them. I don't want him to see them. It's not written for him, nor for you, it's not meant for anyone.\"\n[1966-02-21T13:20:00] Lina's house | I saw myself unwillingly taking the box, wondering where to put it and what I needed it for. We sat down at the table to eat.\n[1966-02-21T13:25:00] Lina's House | I saw that little Rino could already eat by himself, using a set of wooden utensils. I thought what surprised me was.\n[1966-02-21T13:30:00] Lina's House | After his initial shyness, he was actually able to speak to me in clear Italian and answer my questions accurately. He also asked me some questions.\n[1966-02-21T13:35:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina urging me to talk to her son; she hadn't eaten much, just staring absentmindedly at the plate.\n[1966-02-21T14:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her when I was about to leave, and she said to me. \"I can't remember anything about Nino, or about what happened at Vomero and the shops on Piazza Martiri. Even though I feel I loved him more than myself, I don't want to know what actually happened to him, where he went.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:05:00] Lina's house | I said it offhand. I heard, \"It was a momentary impulse, but there's one advantage—it'll pass, and then you'll forget about it.\" I thought she was sincere, but I didn't tell her what I knew about Nino.\n[1966-02-21T14:10:00] Lina's House | I heard the question, \"Are you happy?\" \"Okay.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:15:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"Your hair is really beautiful.\" \"Okay, I guess.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:20:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"You have to do me another favor.\" \"Go ahead,\" I said.\n[1966-02-21T14:25:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Before Stefano, in a fit of rage, kills me and the child, I have to leave this house.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:30:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"You say that, really worries me.\" \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:35:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Tell me, what can I do?\" \"You go find Enzo and tell him I've tried, but I can't do it.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:40:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"I don't understand.\" \"It doesn't matter if you understand or not. You have to go back to Borgo. You have your own life. Just tell him like that: Lina tried, but she couldn't do it.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:45:00] Lina's house | I saw her holding the child as she walked me to the door, and she said to her son. I heard, \"Rino, say goodbye to Aunt Elena.\"\n[1966-02-21T14:50:00] Lina's house | I saw the child smiling and waving at me.\n[1966-02-25T10:00:00] Borgo | I went to find Enzo before returning to Borgo, and I told him. I heard, \"Lina told me she tried, but she couldn't do it.\"\n[1966-02-25T10:05:00] Borgo | I saw no expression on his face. I thought that maybe this news would make him feel indifferent.\n[1966-02-25T10:10:00] Borgo | I saw what I added. I heard, \"She's in a very bad situation, but I don't know how to help her either.\"\n[1966-02-25T10:15:00] Borgo | I saw him press his lips together, his expression very heavy, and then we said goodbye.\n[1966-02-25T14:00:00] On the train | I saw that on the train, I opened the metal box, and inside were eight notebooks—despite swearing I wouldn't open it—I started reading. I thought of the first few lines and it already made me very painful. \n\n(Note: The above translation is literal. For a more natural and fluent English expression while maintaining the original tone and style, a better translation might be:)\n\nI was already in great pain just thinking about the first few lines.\n[1966-03-01T10:00:00] Borgo | I thought about returning to Borgo, and each day became increasingly painful, this condition lasting for several months.\n[1966-03-01T10:05:00] Borgo | I thought about every word Lina wrote, and each one made me feel small. Every sentence, even those she wrote as a child, made me feel that everything I had written before and was writing now was worthless. At the same time, every page she wrote would spark my imagination and my thoughts.\n[1966-03-01T10:10:00] Borgo | I thought that up until then, everything I had written showed that I had always been a confused, bookish boy.\n[1966-03-01T10:15:00] Borgo | I thought that, in the end, I could even recite her notebooks by heart. I felt that the admiration of my male and female classmates, the encouragement and praise from my teachers, and even the entire Borgo Normal University all seemed so dim and colorless.\n[1966-03-01T10:20:00] Borgo | I thought about comparing my life with Lina's turbulent life in Mergellina, and suddenly all I had done in the past seemed meaningless.\n[1966-03-01T10:25:00] Borgo | I know the things she hastily wrote down in those tattered, loose notebooks—what she faced was a world full of heart-stopping events; while I lived in a stable world, inside a tower of ivory, where everything could be foreseen.\n[1966-04-10T10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw Elena hand me a metal box in the spring of 1966; it contained eight notebooks. I saw that she was very tense at that moment.\n[1966-04-10T10:00:10] Posillipo | I heard her say she could no longer leave the box at home, she was afraid her husband would one day read what she had written. I thought about how I took the box without saying a word.\n[1966-04-10T10:00:20] Posillipo | I heard myself say, in a joking tone, that there was too much rope tied around the box. I know our relationship was terrible during that time, but it seemed only I thought so.\n[1966-04-10T10:00:30] Posillipo | I saw that when we met, she felt no bit of embarrassment, and still had feelings for me; she never said a single sharp word. I know we have met very few times.\n[1966-04-10T10:00:45] Posillipo | I saw that I had made a vow. I heard her ask me to swear: never, under any circumstances, to open the box.\n[1966-04-10T10:05:00] Mergellina | I remember everything starting on a Sunday in April, when the daughter of the pastry chef Spagnuolo invited Pinocchio to see a movie at the church cinema.\n[1966-04-10T11:30:00] Train | I saw but as soon as I got on the train, I untied the rope and took out the notebook to read.",

    "text": "[1966-04-10T11:35:00] On the train | I know the notes contain detailed descriptions of events in her life, starting from the last few years of her elementary school all the way up until she handed me the box, but that wasn't a diary. I thought these notes seemed especially like the traces left by someone who was passionate about writing and practicing it.\n[1966-04-10T11:36:00] On the train | I saw before me a wealth of rich and detailed descriptions: a branch, a puddle, a stone, a leaf with white veins, the pots at home, every part of the coffee pot.\n[1966-04-10T11:37:00] On the train | I saw and also read about the detailed layout of the brazier, coal chunks, coal ash, courtyards, main roads, rusted iron frames by the pond, small gardens, and the church.\n[1966-04-10T11:38:00] On the train | I saw the felled trees along the railway, the new buildings, my parents' house, the tools my father and brother used to mend shoes, and the movements they made while working.\n[1966-04-10T11:39:00] On the train | I saw, especially the descriptions of color, how the colors of everything changed at different times of the day.\n[1966-04-10T11:40:00] On the train | I saw that the notes contained not only descriptive text, but also some dialect words and written vocabulary, sometimes circled, but without explanation. I know there are also translation exercises in Latin and Greek.\n[1966-04-10T11:41:00] On the train | I also saw long passages describing the workshops and goods in Mergellina, written in English, and Enzo Scanno driving his donkey cart through the streets every day, pushing a cart full of vegetables and fruits. I know there are also many of her reviews of books she has read and films she has seen at the church cinema.\n[1966-04-10T11:42:00] On the train | I saw her conversations with Pasquale, and the ideas she insisted on when we talked. I thought that although the content of the writing wasn't particularly coherent, anything Lina wrote came to life vividly. The words she wrote when she was eleven or twelve showed no sign of being childish.\n[1966-04-10T11:45:00] On the train | I saw that, in general, her sentences were meticulous and her writing was beautiful. I know to pay great attention to the use of punctuation marks, just as Professor Oliviero once taught us.\n[1966-04-10T11:46:00] On the train | I thought that sometimes, Lina was like a drug in her blood, making people lose their sense of measure—everything became rushed, the rhythm of sentences grew extremely tense, and even punctuation marks disappeared.\n[1966-04-10T11:47:00] On the train | I saw that she soon regained her usual relaxed and lively style, but sometimes her writing would suddenly stop, and on some pages she had drawn twisted trees, misty rolling mountains, and grimacing faces.\n[1966-04-10T11:48:00] Train | I thought that whether the language was clear and orderly or chaotic, I was deeply attracted to her.\n[1966-04-10T11:50:00] On the train | I thought the more I read, the more I felt cheated. A few years ago, when I was on Ischia, the letter she sent me must have been the result of long-term writing practice—so it was written so well!\n[1966-04-10T11:55:00] On the train | I saw myself putting all the notebooks back into the box. I thought to myself: Stop spying!\n[1966-04-11T20:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw that that same evening, after the shop closed, Giggio went to find Pinocchia and told her. \"I heard, 'What are you doing here alone? Come over to my parents' house and watch TV, bring Melina with you.'\"\n[1966-04-15T20:00:00] Posillipo | I thought about it, but soon I couldn't resist the allure of the notebooks, which drew me in just like Lina's charm had always done since childhood.\n[1966-04-15T20:05:00] Posillipo | I saw her talking about the people in Mergellina, her family, the Solara brothers, and Stefano. I thought about how she described everything and everyone with a precise, merciless pen.\n[1966-04-15T20:10:00] Posillipo | I saw, for example, how she unreservedly described her views on me—what she said about me, what she thought of me, what she loved about me, and even my appearance. I thought of those decisive moments for her, which she recorded one by one, without the slightest concern for others or anything else.\n[1966-04-15T20:15:00] Posillipo | I saw the purest joy she felt when she wrote The Blue Fairy at the age of ten. I thought of the pain she had endured and the joy she had experienced, both as intense as each other. As for the stories she wrote, Teacher Oliviero not only refused to comment on them but completely ignored them.\n[1966-04-15T20:20:00] Posillipo | I saw her pain and anger. I had entered junior high school, no longer cared about her, and drifted away from her.\n[1966-04-15T20:25:00] Posillipo | I saw her passion for making shoes, which was driven by a strong desire for revenge, prompting her to design those new shoes. I knew that when she and her brother Rino finished their first pair of shoes, I saw her joy, and when her father Fernando said the shoes they made were not good, I felt her pain.\n[1966-04-15T20:30:00] Posillipo | I saw that in these notebooks, she had recorded everything, especially her hatred for the Solara brothers. I knew she had firmly rejected Marcello's proposal, Marcello being the eldest of the Solara brothers.\n[1966-04-15T20:35:00] Posillipo | I saw that she had also written down her own resolve, and the moment she became engaged to the gentle Stefano Carraci. I know that Stefano is the boss of Capodimonte. To pursue Lina, he bought the first pair of shoes she ever made and swore to keep them safe for the rest of his life.\n[1966-04-15T20:40:00] Posillipo | I saw her writing down that beautiful time from when she was fifteen, when she felt like a noblewoman, living in the care of her fiancé, rich and aristocratic. I know that out of love for her, Stefano invested in Lina's father and brother's shoemaking shop, expanding it into the \"Lina\" shoe workshop. I thought about how content Lina had been back then! Her dream of having shoes was almost fully realized.\n[1966-04-15T20:45:00] Posillipo | I saw her get married at sixteen, with a house in the new Mergellina, and the wedding was very lavish and extravagant, she was very happy. I knew, but at that moment, Marcello and his brother Michele appeared at the wedding. The shoes on Marcello's feet were exactly the ones her husband Stefano had said he would cherish for life.\n[1966-04-15T20:50:00] Posillipo | I wondered what kind of man she had finally married! But it was already too late. Could I really tear off the mask and reveal his repulsive true face? The issue and the truth were stark and undeniable; her pitiful situation was painfully obvious.\n[1966-04-20T20:00:00] Pizza Shop | I always saw things as a chain of events; when she and her boyfriend Michele went out in the evening, she would also take her along, and they often went to eat pizza together as a group of five. I knew the pizzeria was in the San Lucia district downtown. Michele was driving, Giorgina looking dazzlingly dressed in the front passenger seat, while Rello, Antonio, and Pinochia were sitting in the back.\n[1966-04-20T20:10:00] Pizza Shop | I saw that Antonio didn't want to spend his free time with his boss either. At first, he told Pinochia that he had something to do and couldn't eat with them. I know, but Giggio said that his absence would make Michele very angry.\n[1966-04-20T20:15:00] Pizza Shop | I saw him pull his head into his shoulders, and from then on, he began to obey orders.\n[1966-04-20T20:30:00] Pizza Place | I saw Solara often leave them to chat with the pizzeria owner, and there were various transactions between them. I know that when they eat, the two girls mostly talk, while Michele and Antonio hardly say a word.\n[1966-04-20T20:35:00] Pizza Shop | I saw Giorgio's brother quietly eating pizza, and he looked pretty bored too.\n[1966-04-20T20:40:00] Pizza Shop | I know the two girls's favorite topic was the love between Pinocchia and Stefano. They talked about the gifts Stefano had given her, and about their pleasant vacation in Stockholm the previous August. How many lies Pinocchia had told poor Pasquale.\n[1966-04-20T20:45:00] Pizza Shop | I saw them still chatting in Capodimonte. Pinocchia was now the owner. Pinocchia talked and talked, getting more and more excited, while Giggia listened, occasionally interjecting a word. I heard, \"If possible, the church should be able to cancel the marriage.\"",

    "text": "[1966-04-20T20:50:00] Pizza Place | I saw Pinocchio immediately stop talking; she frowned and said. \"I know, but it's too hard.\"\n[1966-04-20T20:55:00] Pizza Shop | \"I heard 'It's difficult, but not impossible. We need to go find the Holy Wheel Court.'\" \"What is that?\"\n[1966-04-20T21:00:00] Posillipo | I spent many days, even many weeks, immersed in her writing, studying these notes and even memorizing the passages I loved. I thought about the passages that inspired me, made me lose myself, or made me feel ashamed. Behind these seemingly authentic and natural words, there must also be some falsehood, I just hadn't noticed it.\n[1966-04-20T21:05:00] Posillipo | I began telling about her honeymoon, but this time I told about her honeymoon, not the one she had told me at the staircase, but the one I read later in her notebook. I thought about the scene where I once again imagined myself lifting her veil and sunglasses.\n[1966-04-20T21:06:00] Posillipo | I realized I had been unfair to her. Earlier, in order to belittle her, I had thought she gave in too easily, just as I had felt when Nino left me alone in the banquet hall—I wanted to make her feel inferior to ease my own sense of defeat.\n[1966-04-20T21:07:00] Convertible car | I saw her sitting in the convertible, wearing a blue outfit and a blue hat, her eyes red from anger. I know the truth is that when the banquet ended.\n[1966-04-20T21:08:00] Convertible car | After Stefano started the car, she cursed him with the dirtiest, most unbearable words we had.\n[1966-04-20T21:09:00] Convertible car | I forced a smile, said nothing, and Lina finally fell silent too. I knew, as usual, he was enduring her insults.\n[1966-04-20T21:10:00] Convertible car | I saw it, but the silence didn't last long. Lina attacked him again, this time slowly, calmly, without urgency. I heard her say she didn't want to stay in the car anymore, couldn't stand it for another minute. She hated breathing in the air he exhaled, and she wanted to get out right away.\n[1966-04-20T21:11:00] Convertible car | I saw the disgust on Stefano's face, but he kept driving without saying a word.\n[1966-04-20T21:12:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina raise her voice and tell him to stop. At that moment, Stefano stopped the car, and when Lina actually tried to open the car door, Stefano tightly grabbed her arm. I heard him say, \"Now, listen to me.\" He spoke slowly. \"There's a very serious reason why all these things have happened.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:13:00] Convertible car | I saw him calmly explaining to Lina how it had happened.\n[1966-04-20T21:14:00] Convertible car | I heard that only they could guarantee that the shoes would enter the best shoe stores in the city, and even let them open a store on Piazza Martiri, and by autumn, a store specializing in \"Lina\" shoes would be open. I knew that in order to prevent the shoe factory from closing down before it even officially opened, Silvio Solara and his two sons needed to invest.\n[1966-04-20T21:15:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina break free from his hand. I heard, \"Your needs have nothing to do with me!\"\n[1966-04-20T21:16:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano let her go. I heard, \"My needs are your needs. You are my wife!\"  \n\"I? To you I'm nothing, and to me you're the same. Let go of me!\"\n[1966-04-20T21:17:00] Convertible car | I heard, \"So your father and brother are nothing at all?\"  \n\"Whenever you mention them, you'd better rinse your mouth first—you don't even deserve to talk about them.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:18:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano mentioning them by name, saying that the matter of negotiating with Silvio Solara was brought up personally by Fernando. I heard him say that the biggest obstacle was Marcello, who was really angry at Lina. He hated her whole family, especially Pasquale, Antonio, and Enzo, because they had smashed his car and beaten him up.\n[1966-04-20T21:19:00] Convertible car | I heard him say that it was Rino who calmed Marcello down; in any case, they went to a lot of trouble. I knew that Marcello had told Rino he wanted the shoes Lina had made, and Rino had agreed, giving them to him.\n[1966-04-20T21:20:00] Convertible car | \"I heard you say, 'Then you gave him the shoes?'\" she still shouted. I thought it was a terrible moment, and Lina felt a sharp pain in her chest.\n[1966-04-20T21:21:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano look momentarily embarrassed. \"I heard, 'What can I do? Fight with your brother? Ruin your family? Make Marcello retaliate against your friends? Make me lose all the money I've invested?'\"\n[1966-04-20T21:22:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina didn't let him finish, she pounded Stefano's shoulder with her fists. I thought that for Lina, every word he spoke, his tone, was a hypocritical disguise.\n[1966-04-20T21:23:00] Convertible car | \"I heard you say 'Okay'? You just went and gave him the shoes?\"\n[1966-04-20T21:24:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano let her hit and scream at him until Lina tried to open the car door and escape, when he finally said coldly. I heard, \"Stay calm.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:25:00] Convertible car | I saw Lina suddenly turn around and shout that he was blaming her father and brother for all the mistakes, how could she stay calm, the three of them treated her like a dirty rag, how could she possibly stay calm? I heard \"I don't want to calm down!\" Lina screamed, \"You bastard! Take me back right now! You have to go back and say those things you just said to me in front of those other two fucking men.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:26:00] Convertible car | When she said \"dogshit man\" in her dialect, Stefano's slap instantly struck Lina with a loud crack. I knew she realized she had crossed her husband's line, and he could no longer remain calm. I thought of it as the revelation of a truth.\n[1966-04-20T21:27:00] Convertible car | I saw her looking at Stefano in disbelief, and he re-started the car, for the first time losing his calm tone. I felt my face burning painfully. I knew this was the first time he had lost control since he had started pursuing Lina.\n[1966-04-20T21:28:00] Convertible car | I heard him speak in a voice that was slightly trembling: \"You see, it's you who forced me to do this. Have you realized how far you've gone?\"\n[1966-04-20T21:29:00] Convertible car | \"I was wrong,\" she muttered.\n[1966-04-20T21:30:00] Convertible car | I saw Stefano decisively reject her, as he always did with absolute certainty. He spoke at length, somewhat threatening, and also a bit didactic. I saw that they also used a tone filled with pain and anguish.\n[1966-04-20T21:31:00] Convertible car | I heard what he said roughly like this: \"We're absolutely right, Lina. We just need to clarify some facts. You're no longer part of the Lina family. Now you're Mrs.Carracci, and you should do exactly as I told you. I know you're not a worldly person, you don't understand business. You think money just falls from the sky, but it's not like that. You have to earn money every day, and put it where it can make more money.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:32:00] Convertible car | I heard her say, \"You designed the shoes, your father and brother worked really hard, but even the three of you couldn't make any money. The Solara family could—okay, now listen to me, I don't care if you like that guy or not. I hate Marcello too, especially when he looks at you, when I think about what he said about you, I want to stab him in the gut. But when it comes to making money, he's still my best friend.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:33:00] Convertible car | I heard myself say, \"You know why? Because if I don't earn money, this car won't be ours anymore, I won't be able to buy you this dress, we might even lose our house and everything in it. You won't be a rich lady anymore, and our child will grow up like a beggar. So, if you talk to me like that again tonight, I'll beat your pretty face so badly you won't be able to show it in public. Do you understand? Answer me.\"\n[1966-04-20T21:34:00] Convertible car | I saw that she didn't answer him. I saw Lina's eyes squinting, her cheeks already purple, while the rest of her face was very pale.",

    "text": "[1966-04-20T22:00:00] Amalfi Hotel | That night, they arrived in Amalfi. Since the two of them had never stayed in a hotel before, they felt very uncomfortable. I saw the receptionist speaking to Stefano with a mocking tone, making him feel particularly embarrassed, and he couldn't help but act somewhat servile.\n[1966-04-20T22:05:00] Amalfi Hotel | I saw him immediately try to cover his embarrassment with a stiff manner. The receptionist asked him to show his ID. I saw his ears turn red.\n[1966-04-20T22:10:00] Amalfi Hotel | I saw that at the same time, a porter appeared, a man with a short mustache, probably in his fifties. But Stefano pushed him aside as if he were a thief. Yet, after thinking about it, he gave him a generous tip even though he hadn't used the service.\n[1966-04-20T22:11:00] Amarphi Hotel | I saw him carrying his luggage and climbing the stairs ahead of Lina. I heard Lina tell me that each step made her feel that the man she had married that morning was already gone, and now the man with her was a stranger.\n[1966-04-20T22:12:00] Amalfi Hotel | Is this really Stefano, the man with thick short legs, long arms, and pale fingers? Who was the man who ended up with her? The anger I couldn't suppress during the journey had now turned into undeniable anxiety.\n[1966-04-20T22:15:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw him, as soon as he entered the room, trying to make himself gentle. I thought about it, but he was also exhausted. After slapping Lina, he felt very uneasy in his heart.\n[1966-04-20T22:16:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw him praise the spaciousness of the room in a hypocritical tone, then open the sliding window and step onto the balcony, calling her over to feel the fragrance of the air and admire the shimmering sea.\n[1966-04-20T22:17:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw her, and I just shook my head absentmindedly; she was very cold. I thought about her, but she was constantly thinking of a way to escape her predicament.\n[1966-04-20T22:18:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw Stefano immediately shut the window, suggested going for a walk, and said we should eat outside, adding that it was best to dress warmly. I heard him say, \"Why don't you bring me a suit vest?\"\n[1966-04-20T22:19:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I thought about the way she spoke, as if they had been living together for years, and she would easily find a sweater for him from the suitcase, just as naturally as she would for herself.\n[1966-04-20T22:20:00] Amarphi Hotel | I saw Lina acting obedient, but in fact she didn't open her suitcase, neither taking out the sweater nor the suit vest. I thought she was about to come out onto the corridor, she didn't want to stay in the room for another minute.\n[1966-04-20T22:21:00] Amalfi Hotel Corridor | I saw him following behind, muttering to himself. I heard, \"It doesn't matter to me, but I'm worried about you, afraid you might catch a cold.\"\n[1966-04-20T22:30:00] Amalfi Street | I saw them loitering around Amalfi, walking all the way to the cathedral, climbing the steps, and stopping in front of the fountain.\n[1966-04-20T22:31:00] Amalfi Street | I saw Stefano trying to cheer her up, but making people laugh had never been his strength. I thought he was more skilled at tragic words, or the kind of concise, aphoristic statements that a mature man who knows exactly what he wants would say.\n[1966-04-20T22:32:00] Amalfi Street | I saw Lina barely responding, and finally her husband pointed at this and that, exclaiming in surprise. I heard \"Look! Look!\"\n[1966-04-20T22:33:00] Amalfi Street | I heard him saying over and over, \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" I thought, but for her, in the past she might have paid attention to every blade of grass and each stone here. Now, however, she showed no interest in the beautiful scenery by the street, the fragrance of the garden, or the history and art of Amalfi. Especially Stefano's voice annoyed her.\n[1966-04-20T22:35:00] Amalfi Street | I saw Lina start to shiver quickly, not because it was especially cold, but because she was extremely nervous and anxious.\n[1966-04-20T22:36:00] Amalfi Street | I saw him realize it and suggested she go back to the hotel. He even dared to say something. I heard, \"If we hold each other, we'll get warm.\"\n[1966-04-20T22:40:00] Amalfi Street | I saw her, but she still wanted to keep walking until she was completely exhausted.\n[1966-04-20T22:50:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw her walk straight into a restaurant, even though she wasn't hungry at all, without asking Stefano's opinion, and Stefano patiently followed her.\n[1966-04-20T23:00:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw them order a lot of dishes, but they didn't eat much, just drank a lot of wine.\n[1966-04-20T23:05:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw that for a moment, he couldn't help but ask her if she was still angry. Hearing the question, Lina shook her head. She really wasn't angry. I thought it was surprising that toward the Solara brothers, her father and brother, and Stefano, there was not even a trace of hatred in my heart, and everything had simply faded away.\n[1966-04-20T23:06:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought about how everything in her mind had changed suddenly. The issue with the shoes now seemed insignificant to her, and she even wondered why she had been so angry when she saw Marcello wearing those shoes.\n[1966-04-20T23:07:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought that what was now making her feel fear was the heavy, shiny wedding ring on her index finger.\n[1966-04-20T23:08:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought about how she had once again gone over everything that happened that day, and everything seemed unbelievable: the church, the religious wedding ceremony, and the banquet.\n[1966-04-20T23:09:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw her thinking dazedly after drinking alcohol. What have I done? What is this gold ring? What exactly is this shining circle on my hand?\n[1966-04-20T23:10:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw that Stefano also had one, shining between the dark hairs on his hairy fingers.\n[1966-04-20T23:11:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw her remember the way he looked in his swimsuit, just as if I had seen him on the seashore: a broad chest, a huge head like an inverted bowl. I thought about how she would recall the past, but none of the details had any appeal to her.\n[1966-04-20T23:12:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw him in a suit, tie on, his thick lips moving, scratching his large earlobe with his hand. He often used a fork to lift food from her plate, wanting to taste it. I thought he was just a creature, and she felt she couldn't share anything with him.\n[1966-04-20T23:13:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought of him and the sausage seller who had previously attracted her, that ambitious, very self-confident, and well-mannered young man, who had nothing to do with the groom who had married her in the church that morning.\n[1966-04-20T23:14:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw Stefano open his mouth, revealing his white teeth, and his red tongue came out of it. I thought about how everything inside him and around him was breaking apart.\n[1966-04-20T23:15:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw Lina sitting at the table, surrounded by the waiters coming and going, and all the things that had brought her to Amalfi. I thought of the fact that was unbearable, lacking any connection or logic.\n[1966-04-20T23:16:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw that, so when the strange creature before Stefano lit up, thinking the storm had passed, thinking she finally understood why he had done what he did and accepted his explanation, he finally could tell her about his great plans.\n[1966-04-20T23:17:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw Lina thinking about secretly taking a knife from the table, planning that if Stefano dared to touch her when she returned to the room, she would stab him in the throat with it.\n[1966-04-20T23:18:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought in the end, Lina didn't do it, because in that restaurant, at that table, she was so drunk she was out of it. Throughout the whole wedding, from the wedding dress to the wedding ring, everything seemed meaningless to her. She found Stefano's sexual demands meaningless too, and for him, it was equally absurd.\n[1966-04-20T23:19:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I thought that if I were really going to do it, the first thing to consider was how to take the knife with me. I would take the napkin from my lap, wrap the knife in it, put both in my coat, take my handbag over, let the knife slide into it naturally, and finally put the napkin back on the table. But she gave up in the end.\n[1966-04-20T23:20:00] Amalfi Restaurant | I saw that, at the end of dinner, she could no longer hear Stefano's voice. I saw the noise filling her ears—strangers and their thoughts, all leaving her disoriented. I thought about the \"rivet\" that had once firmly connected my wife's new identity, the restaurant, and Amalfi — how loose it had become.\n[1966-04-20T23:30:00] Amalfi Street | I saw that on the way, Stefano began talking about the advantages of the Solara family. He told her that they knew important people in the city government, and that they had connections with various parties, royalists, and even the new Fascist party. I heard him talking about them, pretending to know all about it, as if he really understood what the Solara family was up to. He emphasized, \"Politics is ugly, but it's important for making money.\"\n[1966-04-20T23:31:00] Amalfi Street | I saw her say \"yes,\" but she was clearly not paying attention. I know Lina was recalling the analysis she and Pasquale had done earlier, as well as the conversations they had after their engagement, their plans—to free themselves from the abuse of power, hypocrisy, and brutality of their parents' generation. I thought she was thinking about something else in her mind—whom was I talking about these things with? I didn't know this person in front of me, I didn't know who he was.\n[1966-04-20T23:32:00] Amalfi Street | I saw Stefano holding Lina's hand, telling her he loved her, and she didn't step back. I thought maybe Lina was trying to make him believe everything was normal, that they were truly a newlywed couple on their honeymoon. She wanted to wait for the right moment to tell him how much she actually hated and loathed him, to hurt him even more.\n[1966-04-20T23:33:00] Amalfi Street | I thought she would say that it was the same whether it was with the hotel bellboy or with you—those intimate acts. Both of your fingers were yellow from smoking, and it made me sick.\n[1966-04-20T23:34:00] Amalfi Street | I thought the most likely reason for her might be: she was too scared, trying to push every reaction backward.\n[1966-04-20T23:40:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw them just enter the room when Stefano tried to [intimate] her, but she dodged away.\n[1966-04-20T23:41:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw her open the suitcase with a serious expression, take out her pajamas, and then hand them to her husband.\n[1966-04-20T23:42:00] Amalfi Hotel Room | I saw my husband smile in satisfaction at her consideration, and he tried to grab her again, but she quickly locked herself in the bathroom.\n[1966-04-20T23:45:00] Bathroom of the hotel | I saw Lina alone in the bathroom, trying to sober up and get rid of that lingering sense of fragmentation.",

I thought, what should I do? Should I spend the whole night locked up here? Then what?\n[1966-04-20T23:47:00] Hotel Bathroom | I thought about how she regretted not taking the dinner knife. For a moment, she thought she had taken it, but in the end, she had to admit that she really hadn't.\n[1966-04-20T23:48:00] Hotel Bathroom | I saw her sitting on the edge of the bathtub, comparing the hotel's tub with the one in her new home. She thought her own bathtub was more beautiful, and the towels at home were definitely better than these. Was it hers or his? The towel, the bathtub, all of this belonged to whom?\n[1966-04-20T23:49:00] Hotel Bathroom | I thought about how all these new and beautiful things belonged to the man outside waiting for her, and she felt annoyed because only by taking his name could she possess them. Those good things all belonged to the Carracci family, including herself.\n[1966-04-20T23:50:00] Hotel Bathroom | I saw Stefano knock on the door. There was no response. I heard, \"What are you doing? Are you okay?\"\n[1966-04-20T23:51:00] Hotel Bathroom | I saw Stefano wait a little longer, knock again, but still there was no response. He nervously pulled the door handle and said in a deliberately joking tone. I heard, \"I'm breaking in, okay!\"\n[1966-04-20T23:52:00] Bathroom of the hotel | I thought that Lina had no doubt he would do it, this stranger waiting for her outside was capable of anything. She thought, me too, I'm capable of anything too.\n[1966-04-20T23:53:00] Bathroom of the hotel | I saw her take off her clothes, brush her teeth, and put on her nightgown. I thought about how she had looked at it with disdain, recalling how carefully she had chosen this nightgown several months ago.\n[1966-04-20T23:54:00] Hotel Room | I saw Stefano now sitting on the edge of the bed in his pajamas; as soon as he saw her, he immediately stood up. I thought of Stefano now as just a name, no longer connected to the emotions and habits he had possessed just a few hours ago.\n[1966-04-20T23:55:00] Hotel Room | I heard, \"You're taking a really long time to wash.\"  \n\"It does take some time.\"  \n\"You're so beautiful!\"  \n\"I'm tired, I want to sleep.\"  \n\"Let's sleep together later.\"\n[1966-04-20T23:56:00] Hotel Room | I heard, \"Now you sleep on your side, I'll sleep on mine.\"  \n\"Okay, come on.\"  \n\"I'm not joking.\"  \n\"I'm not either.\"\n[1966-04-20T23:57:00] Hotel Room | I saw Stefano smile and try to take her hand. She pulled away, and he frowned. I heard, \"What's wrong with you?\"\n[1966-04-20T23:58:00] Room in a hotel | I saw Lina hesitate. She wanted to find the right words, speaking slowly and deliberately. I heard, \"I don't want you.\"\n[1966-04-20T23:59:00] Room in a hotel | I saw Stefano shaking his head in confusion, as if she had spoken a foreign language. He said softly that he had been waiting for this moment for a long time, longing for it day and night.\n[1966-04-21T00:00:00] Hotel Room | I saw him pointing at his scarlet pajamas and smirked slightly. \"I beg you,\" he pleaded, looking almost sad, \"Look! Just seeing you here is going to bring something bad.\"\n[1966-04-21T00:01:00] Hotel Room | I saw her reluctantly looking at him, making a tired face, and immediately turning her eyes away.\n[1966-04-21T00:02:00] Hotel Room | I saw it happen and Stefano realized: she was trying to lock herself in the bathroom again. He rushed over like an animal, grabbed her waist, and lifted her, throwing her onto the bed. I thought about what was happening? It was obvious, he didn't want to know.\n[1966-04-21T00:03:00] Hotel Room | I saw him smiling as he pressed down on her, trying to make her quiet. I thought he believed that in the restaurant they had already made up, and he didn't understand why Lina was acting like this now—too childish.\n[1966-04-21T00:04:00] Hotel Room | \"I heard, 'That's a beautiful thing.' He said, 'You don't have to be afraid, I love you more than I love my mother and sister.'\"\n[1966-04-21T00:05:00] Hotel Room | I saw it but didn't act in time; she stood up and avoided him. I thought to myself, how difficult it is to figure out this girl's mind! When she says \"yes,\" she really means \"no,\" and when she says \"no,\" she actually means \"yes.\"\n[1966-04-21T00:06:00] Hotel Room | I saw Stefano whisper, \"Stop acting like a child.\" He grabbed her again, straddling her, and pressed her hands onto the bedsheet. I heard him say, \"You said we would wait, and so we have waited until this day.\" He said, \"It's right here by your side, but I couldn't touch you—it was so hard! I endured it. But now we are married, so be good and don't worry.\"\n[1966-04-21T00:07:00] Hotel Room | I saw him lean down to kiss her, but she dodged, her face swaying left and right, struggling constantly, her body twisted, insisting again and again. I heard, \"Let me go! I don't want you! I don't want you! I don't want you!\"\n[1966-04-21T00:08:00] Hotel Room | I saw that moment, and Stefano couldn't help raising his voice; he shouted. I heard, \"Lina, I can't fucking stand it anymore!\"\n[1966-04-21T00:09:00] Hotel Room | I saw him repeat it two or three times, his voice growing louder, as if imitating an ancient spell—a rule that existed before he was born. I know the rule: you have to be a man, Stret! Either make her submit right now, or she'll never submit; let your wife understand that she's a woman and you're a man, so she should obey you.\n[1966-04-21T00:10:00] Hotel Room | I saw Lina, and all I could hear was him saying, \"I can't fucking stand it! I can't fucking stand it! I can't fucking stand it!\" I saw him lying on top of her slender waist, his body broad and clumsy, his genitals lifting the nightgown like a tent.\n[1966-04-21T00:11:00] Hotel Room | I know she remembers how, a few years ago, he pinched her tongue with his hand, trying to poke it with a needle, because she had beaten his brother Alfonso Carracci in a school competition, humiliating him. I thought, and suddenly realized: he had always been Don Achille's eldest son!\n[1966-04-21T00:12:00] Hotel Room | I saw the idea make her husband's youthful face suddenly show some features. I thought that, out of caution, these traits had been silently hidden, but they had always remained in Stefano's blood, waiting for the right moment to emerge.\n[1966-04-21T00:13:00] Hotel Room | I saw that because of his politeness, the contours of his face had softened, his gaze had become gentle, his voice carried a tone of flattery, and his fingers, hands, and entire body were all trying hard to control themselves. Yes, I thought, Stefano had been trying hard to play another person in order to win people's hearts in Mergellina and to please her.\n[1966-04-21T00:14:00] Room in a Hotel | I saw it, but now his facial contours are changing. I thought of Lina's heart filled with fear, that kind of fear we both experienced as children, more terrifying than the time we went down to the cellar to look for a doll.\n[1966-04-21T00:15:00] Hotel Room | I thought I saw Don Achille reviving from the muck of this Mergellina, taking possession of his son. Don Achille was emerging from Stefano's skin, changing his gaze, bursting out from his body. He had already arrived!\n[1966-04-21T20:00:00] Pinochia's House | I saw that what made her uncomfortable was her brother's hostility toward her. In fact, every time they went home, they would fight. Sometimes, Antonio would even slap her face, shouting loudly. I heard, \"What the hell did you tell everyone about your messed-up business? Do you have any idea how much of a whore you are? You've made me a pimp too!\"",

    "text": "[1966-04-21T20:05:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw her speak in a tone she was capable of, the most repulsive one. I heard, \"Do you know why Michele is having dinner with us?\"\n[1966-04-21T20:10:00] Pinocchio's House | I heard, \"Because he's my boss.\" \"That's also a reason.\"\n[1966-04-21T20:15:00] Pinocchio's House | \"I heard 'Then why?' 'Because I'm with Stefano, he's an important person. If I wait for you to succeed, Melina's daughter will always remain Melina's daughter.'\"\n[1966-04-21T20:20:00] Pinochia's House | I saw Antonio losing his patience and said to her. I heard, \"You're not with Stefano, you're Stefano's mistress.\"\n[1966-04-21T20:25:00] Pinocchio's house | I saw Pinocchio start to cry. I heard, \"It's not true, Stefano only loves me.\"\n[1966-04-25T19:00:00] Lina's New House | I knew that four days later, they returned to Mergellina.\n[1966-04-25T20:00:00] Lina's New Home | That evening, Stefano invited my father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law to our house, and with a more humble tone than usual, asked Fernando to tell Lina about the matter between her and Silvio Solara.\n[1966-04-25T20:05:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw later that Melina accidentally hit her daughter's foot with a broom, triggering a series of terrible reactions.\n[1966-04-25T20:10:00] Lina's new house | I saw Fernando, with an expression of displeasure, using fragmented sentences to repeat to his daughter what Stefano had said.\n[1966-04-25T20:15:00] Lina's new house | I saw Stefano quickly have Rino explain why he gave the shoes to Marcello, saying they were in conflict but had to agree with Marcello and give him the pair he wanted.\n[1966-04-25T20:16:00] Lina's New Home | I saw Rino put on an air of worldly sophistication, speaking earnestly and indignantly. I heard, \"In many situations, we have to make some sacrifices.\"\n[1966-04-25T20:17:00] Lina's New Home | I saw him bringing up the trouble Pasquale, Antonio, and Enzo had gotten into — they had beaten up the Solara brothers and smashed their car.\n[1966-04-25T20:18:00] Lina's New Home | I saw him gradually raising his voice, speaking to his sister. \"I heard 'Do you know who's at greater risk? It's them—their friends, your Knights of the Temple. Marcello has recognized them, and he's certain it was you who sent them. What should I do with Stefano? Do you want them to suffer retaliation?\"\n[1966-04-25T20:19:00] Lina's new house | I heard, \"They beat someone, they'll have to pay double. Do you want to ruin them? What can you do? Just because of a pair of size 43 shoes your husband can't wear and that leak in the rain? Marcello really cared about those shoes. To stop him from pursuing it, we gave them to him.\"\n[1966-04-25T20:20:00] Lina's New House | I saw that the same words could be said in many ways. Lina had always been very good at speaking, but surprisingly, she didn't say anything that time.\n[1966-04-25T20:21:00] Lina's new house | I saw Rino relax. He spoke to her in a slightly reproachful tone, saying that ever since she was young, she had always been chasing after him, saying she wanted to get rich. Now he was smiling. I heard, \"Let's get rich, life is already complicated enough, don't let it get more complicated.\"\n[1966-04-25T20:25:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw Antonio say. I heard, \"She didn't mean to.\"\n[1966-04-25T20:30:00] Lina's New House | I saw that at this moment the doorbell rang — a surprise for Lina, but obviously not for the others.\n[1966-04-25T20:31:00] Lina's New House | I saw Pinocchia, Alfonso Carracci, and their mother Maria arriving, carrying a tray of pastries made by Spagnuolo, the pastry chef from the Solara family.\n[1966-04-25T20:35:00] Lina's new house | I saw Stefano showing everyone the wedding photos, which he had just picked up from the photographer (as for the video, he said it would take some time to get). I knew that at first, they seemed to be celebrating the newlyweds' return from their honeymoon.\n[1966-04-25T20:40:00] Lina's New House | I saw the pastries were for another couple—Rino and Pinnocchia—and all the tension instantly disappeared. I thought about it, but soon everyone understood that, in their eyes, Stefano and Lina's wedding was already a thing of the past.\n[1966-04-25T20:45:00] Lina's new house | I saw that just a few minutes ago, Rino had been speaking in a rude manner, but now he suddenly became gentle, saying exaggerated sweet words, saying that they would hold their engagement ceremony in his sister's beautiful house.\n[1966-04-25T20:46:00] Lina's New Home | I saw him pull out a small package with dramatic flair from his pocket, then take out a black jewelry box from it. He opened the box and a diamond ring appeared.\n[1966-04-25T20:47:00] Lina's new house | I saw Lina notice that the diamond ring was no different from the one she wore next to her wedding ring. I thought about how she was wondering where her brother had gotten the money from.\n[1966-04-25T20:50:00] Lina's new house | After embracing, they all talked about the future. I knew the Solara brothers were planning to open a \"Lina\" shoe store on Martiri Square in the fall, and they were wondering who would run it.\n[1966-04-25T20:55:00] Lina's new house | I saw Rino say that Pinocchio might take over, maybe alone, or with Giggia. I know that she and Michele are now officially engaged, and she will certainly make this request. I thought this family gathering had become very pleasant and full of hope.\n[1966-04-25T21:00:00] Lina's New Home | I saw Lina standing almost all the time, because sitting down would hurt her. I saw that no one mentioned her swollen, blackened right eye, her split lower lip, or her arm that had been subjected to physical violence, not even Lina's mother, who remained silent all along.\n[1966-04-26T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that in the following days, he was trying desperately to move on from this tragedy, pretending not to hear and not to see, avoiding passing by the old Capodimonte as much as possible.\n[1966-04-26T10:05:00] The Old Library | I saw that if he happened to meet Stefano, he would immediately look away, fighting hard to suppress the urge to punch him.\n[1966-04-26T10:10:00] Mergellina | I thought about how he was suffering from a headache, how he didn't understand what was right and what was wrong. Had he made a mistake by not handing Lina over to Michele?\n[1966-04-26T10:15:00] Mergellina | I wondered whether Lina's sister's situation would have changed if Lina hadn't returned to her husband. Everything was a coincidence, he thought, and nothing was truly good or truly evil.\n[1966-04-26T10:20:00] Mergellina | I saw it, but at that moment, his mind got stuck again, as if to escape those nightmares, he had started arguing with Pinocchia once more.\n[1966-04-26T10:25:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw him shouting at his younger sister. I heard, \"He's a married man with young children. You're even worse than our mother. You really have no brain at all.\"\n[1966-04-26T11:00:00] Elena's House | Every time I saw Pinocchio, I would go find Giggla and tell her. I heard, \"My brother is crazy, my brother wants to kill me.\"\n[1966-05-01T10:00:00] Borgo | I knew I was living alone at the time because Franco Mari had already been expelled from school. I thought about it and felt very worried. For several months, I couldn't study properly. I felt completely worthless, utterly pessimistic.\n[1966-05-01T10:05:00] Borgo | I thought to myself that I finally realized, if I continued like this, I would also get a terrible grade and be expelled back home.\n[1966-05-01T14:00:00] Mergellina | I saw it like this: one afternoon, Michele called Antonio over and sent him to Germany for a rather delicate matter.\n[1966-05-01T14:05:00] Mergellina | I saw that Antonio didn't refuse, on the contrary, he left happily, without saying goodbye to his sister or Melina.\n[1966-05-01T14:10:00] Mergellina | I thought about him, thinking that abroad, among those people who spoke like Nazi soldiers in a cinema, they would definitely stab him to death, shoot him dead, but he was happy.\n[1966-05-01T14:15:00] Mergellina | I thought that it was better than continuing to watch his mother and sister suffer, unable to do anything; he would rather be killed.\n[1966-05-01T15:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that before leaving by train, the only person he wanted to see was Enzo, but he found Enzo very busy. I knew that during that time, he was selling everything: the donkey, the cart, his mother's small shop, and the vegetable patch by the railway.\n[1966-05-01T15:05:00] Mergellina | I saw him wanting to give the money to an unmarried aunt, asking her to take care of his brothers and sisters.\n[1966-05-01T15:10:00] Mergellina | \"I don't know, what are you going to do?\" Antonio asked him. \"I'm going to find a job,\" he said.\n[1966-05-01T15:15:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"Are you going to change your life?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1966-05-01T15:20:00] Mergellina | \"I did well.\" \"I had to do it.\"",

I'm leaving now, I don't know when I'll be back. Please, can you sometimes go and check on my mother, my sister, and the children?\"\n[1966-05-01T15:35:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"If I were in Mergellina, I would go see them.\"\n[1966-05-01T15:40:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"We were all wrong, Enzo. We shouldn't have brought Lina back.\" \"Maybe so.\"\n[1966-05-01T15:45:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"Everything's a mess, I don't know how to wrap it up.\" \"That's true.\"\n[1966-05-01T15:50:00] Mergellina | I saw that they didn't even shake hands. I heard \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\"\n[1966-05-01T16:00:00] Place: Garibaldi Square | I saw Antonio arrive at Garibaldi Square and board the train.\n[1966-05-01T20:00:00] On the train | I knew he had gone through a very long, unbearable journey, day and night. I thought of how he felt various angry voices flowing through his blood.\n[1966-05-02T10:00:00] On the train | I saw that just a few hours later, he felt very tired, his legs numb. I know that since he returned from the army, he hasn't been far from home.\n[1966-05-02T12:00:00] Train Station | I saw him getting off the train now and then to drink a little water at the fountain, but he was worried the train would leave without him.\n[1966-05-02T16:00:00] Train Station Mergellina | I later heard him say that at the Mergellina station, he felt terrible. He thought: I'll stop here, I'll go look for Elena.\n[1966-05-10T10:00:00] Mergellina | I knew that after Antonio left, Girolama and Pinocchia's relationship became even closer.\n[1966-05-10T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Giggia suggesting to Melina's daughter—this was something she had thought about for a long time, and it was no longer sensible to keep waiting foolishly; she should force Stefano to resolve the issue.\n[1966-05-10T10:10:00] Mergellina | \"I heard 'Lina has to get out of that house.' She said to Pinochietta, 'You should move in, because if you wait too long, once your charm fades, you'll lose everything, including your job at Capodimonte, because if Lina wants to reclaim her territory, she'll have Stefano kick you out.\"\n[1966-05-10T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw Giullara even telling Pinocchia about her own experience, because at that time she and Michele had also encountered the same problem. \"I heard her say, 'If I wait for him to marry me,' she whispered, 'then I'll end up an old maid. I'm really giving him hell: either we get married before the spring of 1968, or I'm leaving him, fuck it!\"\n[1966-05-15T23:00:00] Apartment in the Rettifilo District | I saw it happen, and Pinocchio trapped Stefano in a net. I thought of the sticky, muddled lust, which made him feel like a very special man.\n[1966-05-15T23:05:00] Apartment in the Rettifilo District | I saw Pinocchio whispering into his chest. I heard, \"You have to make a decision, Stel! Either be with me or with her.\"\n[1966-05-15T23:10:00] Apartment in Rettifilo District | I heard, \"I didn't mean you should kick her and the child out onto the street. That's your child, you have an obligation, but you could just give her some money, like those important people or actors do.\"\n[1966-05-15T23:15:00] Apartment in the Rettifilo District | \"I heard, 'Now everyone at Mergellina knows that I am your real wife, and I want to be with you forever and ever.'\"\n[1966-05-15T23:20:00] Apartment in Rettifilo District | I saw Stefano tightly embracing Pinocchia on the uncomfortable little bed in the Rettifilo district. I heard someone say to her, \"Okay.\"\n[1966-05-16T20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw him go back home, but instead of doing anything, he just yelled at Lina. First, it was about the dirty socks she wasn't wearing, then it was about how he'd seen her talking to Pasquale or someone else again. He didn't take any real action.\n[1966-06-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | At that moment, Pinocchio went crazy. On a Sunday morning, she met Pinocchio.\n[1966-06-01T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw Pinocchia complaining that they were treated very differently in the two Capodimontes, and as she spoke, the two of them began to talk badly about Lina. I thought that, for various reasons, they all considered Lina to be the source of their misfortune.\n[1966-06-01T10:10:00] Mergellina | I read until the end, and Pinochcia couldn't help but tell Pinochcia about her feelings, even forgetting that Pinochcia was her ex-boyfriend's sister.\n[1966-06-01T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw that Pinocchia was eager to join the conversation, and she listened with pleasure to Pinocchia's story, occasionally adding fuel to the fire by offering some suggestions. I thought about hurting Pinocchia as much as possible because she betrayed Pasquale, and also hurting Lina because Lina had betrayed her.\n[1966-06-01T10:20:00] The Old Library | I thought, but I had to say it: besides her full heart of resentment, she also felt a certain excitement, because she was involved with a woman who had such a story, her childhood playmate, who later openly became the mistress of a married man.\n[1966-06-01T10:25:00] Mergellina | I know our girl from Mergellina, she's always wanted to get married since she was a child. After growing up, we always feel sympathy for women who become mistresses. We think these women are more exciting, more competitive, especially when they're more fashionable.\n[1966-06-01T10:30:00] The Old Library | I thought that, in a way, we both hoped the man's legal wife would get a serious illness and die (usually these legal wives were very cunning or had betrayed their husbands before), and then the mistress would be elevated to the position of wife, fulfilling her dream of being a wife.\n[1966-06-01T10:35:00] Mergellina | I thought that, in the end, we are accustomed to taking the lover's side, making everything that followed seem reasonable.\n[1966-06-01T10:40:00] Mergellina | I saw Pinocchio, despite her treachery, her advice was all out of revenge, and in the end, she still passionately supported Pinocchio's love.\n[1966-06-05T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her one day sincerely and genuinely say something to Pinocchia. \"I heard, 'You can't go on like this. You should kick that rotten woman out and marry Stefano, have your child. Ask the Solara brothers if they know anyone from the Holy Office.'\"\n[1966-06-05T20:00:00] Pizza Place | I saw Pinochia immediately accept Pinochia's and Giggia's advice. One evening at the pizzeria, she told Michele directly. I heard, \"Can you get connected with this Holy Wheel Court?\"\n[1966-06-05T20:05:00] Pizza Shop | I saw him respond in a mocking tone. I heard, \"I don't know, I can ask, there are always a couple of friends to find. But now you just hold on to what's yours, that's the most important thing. Don't worry too much about the rest. If someone wants to harm you, let them come to me.\"\n[1966-06-05T20:10:00] Pizza Shop | I thought about Michele's words, which were very important to Pinocchia. She felt like someone was standing by her side, something she had never experienced in her entire life—being supported and recognized.\n[1966-06-05T20:15:00] Pizza Place | I thought that even though Giggler kept encouraging her and Pinocchio had given her some advice, the promise of a very important and authoritative man to protect her made her feel extremely uplifted.\n[1966-08-30T10:00:00] Mergellina | I know she was very angry that time because in August, Stefano didn't take her abroad as he had before, but only took her to the seaside gardens a few times, which wasn't enough to make her decide. I thought she needed a real, concrete reality: she found herself pregnant.\n[1966-09-01T15:00:00] Capodimonte | I was overjoyed by Pinocchia's pregnancy, but she kept the news a secret, not even telling Stefano. One afternoon, she took off her lab coat and left Capodimonte as if to take a breath of fresh air, and went to Lina's house.",

I heard, \"What happened?\"\n[1966-09-01T15:20:00] Lina's front door | I heard Pinocchio answer, \"Nothing has happened that you don't already know about.\"\n[1966-09-01T15:25:00] Lina's House | I saw her go into the house and tell Lina everything in front of the child.\n[1966-09-01T15:30:00] Lina's house | I saw her starting off calmly, talking about some actors and cyclists, even mentioning the mistress of a famous cyclist. She said she was like that mistress, but more up-to-date.\n[1966-09-01T15:35:00] Lina's house | I heard her mention the Holy Office, and she spoke of the Church and God. In certain cases, if love was strong enough, they could declare some marriages invalid.\n[1966-09-01T15:40:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina listening silently all along, not interrupting her, which was something Pinocchio had not expected. I thought about Pinocchia, hoping she would get angry in a few words and then they would fight, but now Pinocchia was very anxious, pacing back and forth in the room.\n[1966-09-01T15:45:00] Lina's house | I saw her start to say that she often came to this house and that she was very familiar with it, then she began to criticize Lina. I heard, \"Look at this, it's disgusting—dirty dishes, dust, socks, and underpants lying on the floor. That poor man couldn't possibly live like this.\"\n[1966-09-01T15:50:00] Lina's House | I saw it to the end, she could no longer control herself. She went and picked up the dirty clothes on the bedroom floor, then said loudly. I heard, \"From tomorrow on, I'll clean the house. You can't even make the bed. Look at this, Stefano hates it when the sheets are folded like this. He told me he's told you a thousand times, but it doesn't help.\"\n[1966-09-01T15:55:00] Lina's house | I saw that at this moment she suddenly stopped, feeling confused, then whispered. I heard, \"You have to leave here, Lina! If you don't go, I'll kill you and the child.\"\n[1966-09-01T16:00:00] Lina's house | I heard Lina say just one thing: \"Your behavior is just like your mother's, Pinocchio.\"\n[1966-09-01T16:05:00] Lina's House | I thought this was what she had said. Now I could imagine her voice: she never spoke in a sentimental way. She must have said the words as usual, with cold malice or with a distant tone.\n[1966-09-01T16:10:00] Lina's house | I thought of many years later, when she told me that seeing Pinocchia in that state at her house reminded her of Melina, the abandoned lover, and the moment the entire Nino family left Mergellina. She seemed to see that iron flying out of the window, almost hitting Nino and killing him.\n[1966-09-01T16:15:00] Lina's House | I thought it was a long, painful flame that had shocked her, and now that same flame was burning inside Pinochia, but this time it wasn't the flame caused by Nino's wife, but rather the flame within herself—Lina.\n[1966-09-01T16:20:00] Lina's house | I thought this was a very bad, misleading scene, and at the time none of us could see clearly, but she probably understood what was going on. Maybe she wasn't filled with anger, nor did she show her usual hurtful determination, but rather felt a bitter sorrow and compassion.\n[1966-09-01T16:25:00] Lina's house | I saw that she must have been holding Pinocchio's hand at that moment. I heard, \"Sit down, I'll make you a cup of chamomile tea.\"\n[1966-09-01T16:30:00] Lina's house | I thought, but at this moment, every word and sentence Lina said, especially her final action, made Pinocchia feel humiliated.\n[1966-09-01T16:35:00] Lina's House | I saw her immediately turn away, rolling her eyes. I saw her white of the eye, wide and shocking.\n[1966-09-01T16:40:00] Lina's house | I saw when her pupils returned to normal, she started screaming. \"I heard you say I'm crazy? And I'm just like my mother, crazy? Then you'd better be careful, Lina. Don't touch me, get out of my way, go make yourself some chamomile tea! Now let me clean up this disgusting house.\"\n[1966-09-01T16:45:00] Lina's House | I watched her sweep, mop the floor, and make the bed, saying not a word throughout the entire process.\n[1966-09-01T16:50:00] Lina's House | I saw Lina's eyes following her all the time. I thought about how worried she was that Pinocchio's body would rupture like something moving too fast.\n[1966-09-01T16:55:00] New Mergellina | I saw her take the child and go out, and she stayed in the new Mergellina for a long time, talking constantly to her son, helping him recognize the things around him, telling him their names, and even making up some fairy tales for him. I thought about it, but when she did it, it was less to amuse the child and more to control her own anxiety.\n[1966-09-01T17:30:00] New Mergellina | I saw her, far away, seeing Pinochia come out of the gate, walking hurriedly, as if she were going to be late.\n[1966-09-01T17:35:00] New Mergellina | I saw her go home then.\n[1966-09-01T18:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw Pinocchia return to her workplace. I saw that she was out of breath and very excited.\n[1966-09-01T18:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw Stefano with a dark expression, and I asked her calmly. I heard, \"Where did you go?\"\n[1966-09-01T18:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw her answer in front of the customers waiting to buy something. I heard, \"I helped clean up your house, it was really disgusting.\"\n[1966-09-01T18:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw and then she said to the person outside the counter. I heard, \"The dust on the nightstand is so thick, you could write on it.\"\n[1966-09-01T18:20:00] Capodimonte | I saw Stefano but said nothing. I thought this might disappoint the customers a bit.\n[1966-09-01T20:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw that by closing time, the store was empty, and Pinocchia was cleaning, always glancing at her lover out of the corner of her eye.\n[1966-09-01T20:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw that he didn't react in any special way, still at the checkout counter, calculating the bill and smoking a strong American cigarette.\n[1966-09-01T20:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw him finally crush the cigarette butt, take the pole and pull down the roller door, pulling it from the inside.\n[1966-09-01T20:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw Pinocchio ask cautiously. I heard, \"What are you doing?\" \"We'll take the back door.\"\n[1966-09-01T20:20:00] Capodimonte | I saw him say that, and then he hit her face hard, first with the palm of his hand, then with the back of his hand. She leaned against the counter to keep from passing out.\n[1966-09-01T20:25:00] Capodimonte | I saw him speak in a suppressed voice, because he didn't want to shout. I heard, \"How dare you go to my house? How dare you disturb my wife and son?\"\n[1966-09-01T20:30:00] Capodimonte | I saw that in the end, he felt his heart was about to explode. He tried to calm himself down. It was his first time hitting her, and he trembled as he whisperedwhispered. I heard, \"Never do that again.\"\n[1966-09-01T20:35:00] Capodimonte | I saw him leave the store, leaving her there to bleed alone.\n[1966-09-02T10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that the next day, Pinocchia didn't go to work. She was beaten badly and appeared at Lina's house. When Lina saw the bruises on her face, she immediately let her in.\n[1966-09-02T10:05:00] Lina's house | I saw Melina's daughter say. I heard, \"Make me a cup of chamomile tea.\"\n[1966-09-02T10:10:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina make her a cup.\n[1966-09-02T10:15:00] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'The child is so beautiful.' 'Yes.'\"\n[1966-09-02T10:20:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"He looks exactly like Stefano.\" \"Not at all.\"\n[1966-09-02T10:25:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"They have the same eyes, and the same mouth.\" \"Not at all.\"\n[1966-09-02T10:30:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"If you want to read, go ahead and read. I'll clean the house and take care of the kids.\"\n[1966-09-02T10:35:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina staring at her, almost speaking to her in a teasing tone. I heard, \"Do whatever you want, but don't touch my child.\"\n[1966-09-02T10:40:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Don't worry, I won't hurt him.\"",

'Is it Stefano's?'\"\n[1966-09-02T18:25:00] Lina's House | \"I heard, 'Of course.' 'Does he know?'\"\n[1966-09-02T18:30:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"I don't know.\" I thought then that Lina finally understood her marriage had truly fallen apart, but just like other moments in her life, she sensed a very significant change. She felt neither regret nor worry or anxiety.\n[1966-09-02T20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano return home, and there was his wife reading in the living room, while Pinocchia and the children played in the kitchen. The whole house was clean and shining, filled with the scent of dinner.\n[1966-09-02T20:05:00] Lina's house | I saw him realize that his beating had not worked. I saw his face turn pale and he couldn't catch his breath.\n[1966-09-02T20:10:00] Lina's house | I saw him whisper something to Pinocchia. I heard, \"You can go.\" \"I'm not leaving!\"\n[1966-09-02T20:15:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"What do you really want?\" \"I want to stay here.\"\n[1966-09-02T20:20:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"Are you trying to drive me crazy?\" \"Yes, then we'll both be crazy.\"\n[1966-09-02T20:25:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina close the book, then she picked up the child and said nothing. She locked herself and the child in the small room. I saw the room where I had studied before, and now little Rino is sleeping there.\n[1966-09-02T20:30:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano whispering to his lover. I heard, \"You'll destroy me. You don't really love me, Pinocchio. You want me to lose all my customers, to make me a pauper?\"\n[1966-09-02T20:35:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"You know business isn't so good anymore. Please, tell me what you want, and I'll give it to you.\"\n[1966-09-02T20:40:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"I want to be with you forever.\" \"Okay, but not here.\"\n[1966-09-02T20:45:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Right here.\" \"This is Posillipo, with Lina and my son.\"\n[1966-09-02T20:50:00] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'From now on, I'm also going to live here, I've [childbearing status].'\"\n[1966-09-02T20:55:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano sit down, and he silently looked at Pinocchio and her belly standing before him. I thought as if I could see the child forming through her belly, her underwear, her skin—a living child about to jump onto him.\n[1966-09-02T21:00:00] Lina's house | I was watching when someone knocked on the door. The one who knocked was a waiter from Capodimonte, a sixteen-year-old newly hired.\n[1966-09-02T21:05:00] Lina's house | I saw him tell Stefano that Michele and Marcello wanted to see him immediately.\n[1966-09-02T21:10:00] Lina's house | I saw Stefano immediately set out, and he said to Pinochietta, \"Stay here and don't move.\" I thought that this request was a lifeline for him, something that would let him escape the storm at home.\n[1966-09-02T21:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her smile at him and nod.\n[1966-09-02T21:30:00] In Sola's car | I saw Stefano immediately leave and get into the Solara brothers' car. I thought to myself: Maybe I really am in trouble, what should I do?\n[1966-09-02T21:35:00] In Soraya's car | I thought, if my father were still alive, he would definitely hit me with an iron rod and break my leg. Women, debts, the red notebook of Signora Solara, where did I go wrong?\n[1966-09-02T21:40:00] In Sola's car | I thought of Lina, it was Lina who destroyed me. What do Marcello and Michele want, anyway? Why are they so urgent?\n[1966-09-02T22:00:00] Sorara Office | I saw him later realize that they were asking for the old Capodimonte, they didn't say it outright, but left him to figure it out himself.\n[1966-09-02T22:05:00] Sorara Office | I saw Marcello just say that he could lend him some more money, but he said that the shoes called \"Lina\" had to be completely theirs, because they could no longer stand Rino, that lazy and utterly useless guy.\n[1966-09-02T22:10:00] Sorara Office | I saw, but they needed a mortgage, real estate? A shop? Think about it, he said. Then he left, saying he had something to do.\n[1966-09-02T22:15:00] Sorara Office | At that moment, only Stefano and Michele were left facing each other, discussing for a long time whether Rino and Fernando's small factory could still be saved.\n[1966-09-02T22:20:00] Sorara Office | I saw them looking at it, not using the mortgage Marcello had mentioned, trying to see if it could solve the problem.\n[1966-09-02T22:25:00] Sorara Office | I saw but in the end Michele shook his head. I heard, \"The things you've done are ugly, and they don't do any good for business.\"\n[1966-09-02T22:30:00] Sorara Office | I heard, \"I don't understand what you're saying?\" \"I understand myself. Who do you love more? Lina or Pinocchia?\"\n[1966-09-02T22:35:00] Sorara Office | I heard, \"That's none of your business.\" \"You can't say that, Strega! If money is involved, your problem is my problem.\"\n[1966-09-02T22:40:00] Sorara Office | I heard him say, \"How do I even begin to explain? We're both men, you know how it is. Lina is my wife, Pinocchia is another matter entirely.\"\n[1966-09-02T22:45:00] Sorara Office | \"I heard, 'So, you prefer Pinocchio?'\" \"Yes.\"\n[1966-09-02T22:50:00] Sorara Office | I saw Michele say. I heard, \"Once you've sorted out the situation, we'll talk.\"\n[1966-10-01T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw Stefano go through very dark days, and in an attempt to escape this chaotic whirlpool, he argued with Pinocchia and with Lina. I know that business often can't be done, and the old Capodimonte is often closed.\n[1966-10-01T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know everyone in Mergellina is watching the joke, and they still remember clearly: at that time, they were a perfect match, a handsome young man and a beautiful girl, with a convertible car. Suraya from Iran and Shah came over, John and Jacqueline Kennedy came over, and now it's come to this.\n[1966-10-15T10:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that Stefano finally gave in, he said to Lina. I heard, \"I found a great place for you and little Rino to live.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:05:00] Lina's House | \"I really appreciate your generosity.\" \"I come to see the child every two weeks.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:10:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"For me, you don't even need to look at him, he's not your son anyway.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:15:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"You really are a piece of shit. Are you forcing me to take action against you?\"\n[1966-10-15T10:20:00] Lina's house | I saw him panting, angry, and I really wanted to go over and hit her. I heard, \"Go ahead and hit me, I've already been beaten into submission. You think about your son, and I'll think about mine.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:25:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"That house is in Piazza del Plebiscito district.\" \"Where is it?\"\n[1966-10-15T10:30:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"I'll take you to see it tomorrow, at the Artist's Square.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:35:00] Lina's house | I suddenly thought of Lina, and Michele's proposal to her came back to me: \"I bought a house at Piazza del Plebiscito, in the Artist's Square. If you're willing, I can take you to see it right away. When I bought this house, I was thinking of you.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:40:00] Lina's House | I thought, \"You can do anything you want there: read, write, come up with something, sleep, laugh, talk, you're there with your child. I just want to watch you, listen to you speak.\"\n[1966-10-15T10:45:00] Lina's house | I saw her shake her head in disbelief and said something to her husband. I heard, \"You really are a jerk!\"\n[1966-10-15T11:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that, Lina was hiding in little Rino's room. I thought about how she was thinking about what she should do.\n[1966-10-15T11:05:00] Lina's house | I thought of her parents' home, a place she never returns to now. She has already left that house behind, and she must take responsibility for her own life. She doesn't want to go back and be someone's daughter anymore.\n[1966-10-15T11:10:00] Lina's house | I thought she couldn't rely on her brother either. Rino was already unreasonable now; he was taking his revenge on Stefano by harassing Pinocchia, and he even started quarreling with his mother-in-law Maria. He was desperate, had no money, and was also heavily in debt.\n[1966-10-15T11:15:00] Lina's house | I thought she had to rely on Enzo, she had always trusted him, and this time was no different, even though he had never shown up, as if he had disappeared from this Mergellina.\n[1966-10-15T11:20:00] Lina's house | I thought of her thinking: He promised me, he said he would get me out of this place. But sometimes she wished Enzo wouldn't keep his promise, because she was afraid she would be a burden to him.\n[1966-10-15T11:25:00] Lina's House | I thought she wasn't worried about the conflict between Enzo and Stefano, because her husband had already given up on himself, although he had the strength of a wild beast, he was actually very weak.\n[1966-10-15T11:30:00] Lina's house | I thought what she was afraid of was Michele—today, not tomorrow, but he would eventually appear before me on a day I didn't expect. If I didn't give in, he would make me pay the price, and he would make those who helped me pay as well.\n[1966-10-15T11:35:00] Lina's House | I thought that, so I'd better just walk away and not get involved with anyone. I should find a job, any job, as long as it could earn some money, so the kids would have something to eat and a place to live.\n[1966-10-15T11:40:00] Lina's house | I felt powerless the moment I thought about children. I wondered what kind of impressions would remain in little Rino's mind, what scenes and words.\n[1966-10-15T11:45:00] Lina's house | I thought about how she must be worried that some sounds had already reached the child's ears: I wonder, when I was carrying him, did he ever hear my voice? I wonder what kind of impressions were left in his mind?\n[1966-10-15T11:50:00] Lina's House | I wondered if he felt love, or the sense of being excluded? Did he feel my excitement? How could I protect a child, love him, feed him, educate him? I had to be a filter, filtering out all the feelings that might hurt him.\n[1966-10-15T11:55:00] Lina's house | I thought about how I had lost his father, someone who didn't even know the child existed and would never have loved him.\n[1966-10-15T12:00:00] Lina's house | I thought about Stefano, who, although not his father, had some feelings for him. He betrayed us because of another woman and a more real child.\n[1966-10-15T12:05:00] Lina's house | What will happen to this child? Now, little Rino knows that if I go to another room, he won't lose me; I'll still be by his side.\n[1966-10-15T12:10:00] Lina's house | I saw him training himself with something, or perhaps with some imagined thing—he was already able to eat with a spoon and fork on his own. I thought he would control some things, change their shapes.\n[1966-10-15T12:15:00] Lina's house | I saw that he wasn't just saying some words anymore, but had already started saying sentences; he spoke Italian, he didn't say \"baby,\" he said \"me.\"\n[1966-10-15T12:20:00] Lina's house | I saw that he could already recognize some letters, and he could find them and spell out his own name. I thought about how he liked all kinds of colors; his personality was very cheerful.\n[1966-10-15T12:25:00] Lina's house | I thought about it, but the situation before me was too terrible. He saw me being beaten, saw me throwing things, cursing, speaking in dialect. I could no longer stay here any longer.\n[1966-11-15T14:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina come out of the room carefully, but I didn't see Stefano or Pinocchia.\n[1966-11-15T14:05:00] Lina's house | I saw her preparing some food for her son and ate a bit herself.\n[1966-11-15T14:10:00] Lina's house | I thought about how she knew that everyone in the Mergellina unit was talking behind her back, spreading rumors.\n[1966-11-15T14:15:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"In ten minutes, I'll be there.\" I saw on a November afternoon, and I heard the phone ring.\n[1966-11-15T14:20:00] Lina's house | I saw her immediately recognize the voice, and she wasn't the least bit surprised. I heard her answer, \"Okay.\" Then she said, \"Enzo... no one is forcing you to do this.\"",

'It involves the Solara brothers.'\"\n[1966-11-15T14:30:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Who the hell cares about the Solara brothers.\"\n[1966-11-15T14:40:00] Lina's house | I saw him ten minutes later; Enzo arrived on time and went upstairs. I saw that Lina had already put her things and the child's things into two suitcases. She left all her jewelry on the nightstand in the bedroom, including the engagement and wedding rings.\n[1966-11-15T14:45:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina say it to him. I heard, \"This is my second time running away from home, but this time I won't look back.\"\n[1966-11-15T14:50:00] Lina's house | I saw Enzo look around; he had never been to this house before. She tugged at one of his arms and said. I heard, \"Stefano might come back anytime; sometimes he comes back early.\"\n[1966-11-15T14:55:00] Lina's house | \"I don't see what the problem is,\" he answered.\n[1966-11-15T15:00:00] Lina's house | I saw him touching some expensive things: vases, ashtrays, and those shiny silver items.\n[1966-11-15T15:05:00] Lina's house | I saw him flip through a small notebook, and Lina had written down things to buy for the children and the family.\n[1966-11-15T15:10:00] Lina's house | I saw him give Lina an inquiring look, asking if she had made up her mind. I heard him say he had found a job at a factory in Stazione Centrale, and he had rented a house with three rooms, though the kitchen was a bit dark.\n[1966-11-15T15:15:00] Lina's house | I saw him add. I heard, \"All these things Stefano could give you, you'll never have again. I can't give you that.\"\n[1966-11-15T15:20:00] Lina's House | I saw it all, and then he said something. I heard, \"You're afraid because you're not yet sure.\"\n[1966-11-15T15:25:00] Lina's house | I saw her holding her son in her arms and making a very impatient expression. I heard, \"I'm certain. I'm not afraid of anything. Let's go.\"\n[1966-11-15T15:30:00] Lina's house | I saw him lingering behind, he tore a page from his shopping list and wrote something on it, then placed it on the table.\n[1966-11-15T15:35:00] Lina's House | \"I heard 'What are you writing?' 'We have the address in St. John's.'\"\n[1966-11-15T15:40:00] Lina's house | \"I heard 'Why?' 'We're not playing hide-and-seek.'\"\n[1966-11-15T15:45:00] Lina's house | I saw him pick up his luggage and start descending the stairs.\n[1966-11-15T15:50:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina lock the door and leave the key in the keyhole.\n[1966-11-15T16:00:00] Solferrino Bridge | I saw it all, on a deep autumn afternoon, I walked out of the house carrying that metal box. I thought about it, but at that time I hadn't clearly figured out where I was going or what I was supposed to do.\n[1966-11-15T16:15:00] Solfi Rino Bridge | I saw myself stopping on the Solferino Bridge, and I threw the box into the Arno River.\n[1966-11-15T16:20:00] Stazione Centrale | I know she isn't at all familiar with Saint John; she went there once with Stefano, and they just stopped in the town center for a cup of coffee. I thought I hadn't left a good impression on this place.\n[1966-11-15T16:25:00] Stazione Centrale | I know, but Pasquale knows this place—he often goes there as a bricklayer and also participates in activities organized by Communist Party. Once, he mentioned this place and expressed his dissatisfaction, saying that it was terrible, both as a workplace and as a location for Communist Party activities.\n[1966-11-15T16:30:00] Stazione Centrale | I heard him say, \"It's just terrible, absolutely disgusting! The more wealth that place produces, the more miserable the people are. Although we're strong, we can't change anything about it.\"\n[1966-11-15T16:35:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw that Pasquale always had a critical attitude towards everything, so I couldn't fully believe what he said.\n[1966-11-15T16:40:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw when Lina arrived here in her Fiat 600. She saw the uneven road, the dilapidated houses, and the newly built buildings.\n[1966-11-15T16:45:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought of her, how she would rather believe she was taking the child to a beautiful seaside town.\n[1966-11-15T16:50:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought that the only thing she was thinking about was how to clarify things with Enzo, to be open and honest with him.\n[1966-11-15T16:55:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought she had thought too much and ended up unable to speak. \"Let's talk about it later,\" she thought.\n[1966-11-15T17:00:00] Enzo's new apartment | I saw that in the end they arrived at Enzo's rented house, a newly built building, and the house was on the third floor. I saw that although it was new, it looked very poor.\n[1966-11-15T17:05:00] Enzo's new apartment | I saw him say that he had bought some basic supplies, and the next day he would start buying everything else. I saw that the house was empty.\n[1966-11-15T17:10:00] Enzo's new apartment | I saw Lina reassuring him, saying he had done enough.\n[1966-11-15T17:15:00] Enzo's new apartment | I saw her stop in front of a large double bed and decide to make things clear to him.\n[1966-11-15T17:20:00] Enzo's new apartment | I saw her speak in a voice full of emotion. \"I've always admired you, Enzo, since we were kids. What you're doing now is even more admirable: you've taught yourself and gotten a certificate. I know that takes perseverance, something I've never had.\"\n[1966-11-15T17:25:00] Enzo's new apartment | I heard myself say, \"You're the most generous person I've ever known. What you're doing for me and little Rino right now, no one else could do. But I can't sleep with you. It's not because we've only seen each other a few times, nor is it because I don't like you. It's just that I don't feel anything right now. I feel like this wall, or this little table.\"\n[1966-11-15T17:30:00] Enzo's new apartment | \"I heard, 'So, if you can live under the same roof with me without touching me, that's fine; if you can't, I understand, and tomorrow morning I'll start looking for another place. You should know, no matter what, I'll always be grateful for what you've done for me.'\"\n[1966-11-15T17:35:00] Enzo's new apartment | I saw Enzo listen to her quietly, never interrupting her.\n[1966-11-15T17:40:00] Enzo's New Apartment | I saw it all, and he pointed to the double bed. I heard, \"You sleep here, I'll sleep on the folding bed.\"\n[1966-11-15T17:45:00] Enzo's new apartment | \"I prefer to sleep on a folding bed.\" \"Where will the child sleep?\"\n[1966-11-15T17:50:00] Enzo's new apartment | I heard, \"I saw there's another folding bed.\" \"Has he already been able to sleep alone?\"\n[1966-11-15T17:55:00] Enzo's new apartment | I heard, \"Yes.\" \"You can stay as long as you want.\"\n[1966-11-15T18:00:00] Enzo's new apartment | \"I heard 'Are you sure?' 'Very sure.'\"\n[1966-11-15T18:05:00] Enzo's new apartment | \"I don't want something bad to happen and ruin our relationship.\" \"Don't worry.\"\n[1966-11-15T18:10:00] Enzo's new apartment | I heard \"I'm sorry.\" \"That's good. If you feel anything, you know where I am.\"\n[1966-11-15T20:00:00] Borgo | I thought I knew nothing about this place called Stazione Centrale.\n[1966-11-15T20:05:00] Borgo | I knew that when they told me Lina and Enzo had gone there, the only thing I thought of was that Bruno Socavo's sausage factory, Nino's friend, was located there. I found this association uncomfortable.\n[1966-11-15T20:10:00] Borgo | I realized I hadn't thought about that summer with Vomero for a long time. The happy vacation had gradually faded, and its bad aspects were starting to emerge.\n[1966-11-15T20:15:00] Borgo | I realized that at that time, every sound, every smell made me sick. The memory that was hardest for me to bear was the incident between me and Donato Nino on the night at the Maronti beach. I cried for a long time, which was somewhat unexpected.\n[1966-11-15T20:20:00] Borgo | The painful events that happened to Lina and Nino made me feel that the night was pleasant.\n[1966-11-15T20:25:00] Borgo | I thought about it, and after a long time, I realized that, in the darkness, on the cold sand, I had sex with the father of the boy I loved—a vulgar man—and it was shameful to be the first to be penetrated.\n[1966-11-15T20:30:00] Borgo | I thought about how ashamed I was for this, and this shame mixed with other feelings of humiliation I had experienced during that time, leaving me completely broken.\n[1966-11-15T23:00:00] Solférino Bridge | I saw that on a November night, I couldn't control myself, and I took the box and went out. I knew that by then I had left San Gregorio Armeno and become a respected university student, and I could no longer stand Lina's influence over me.\n[1966-11-15T23:10:00] Solférino Bridge | I saw myself stopping on the Solferino Bridge, staring at the light seeping out of the cold mist.\n[1966-11-15T23:15:00] Sorflino Bridge | I saw myself placing the box on the railing and slowly pushing the iron box forward until it fell into the river.\n[1966-11-15T23:15:05] Solferrino Bridge | I thought that it was as if Lina herself, with her thoughts, her dialogue, and that cruel attitude of hers that always clashed with anyone, had fallen into the river.\n[1966-11-15T23:15:10] Solférino Bridge | I thought about the way she influenced me, how everyone she had, everything she owned, and all her knowledge had fallen into the river.",

    "text": "[1966-11-15T23:15:15] Sorflino Bridge | I thought of anything related to her—the books and the shoes, the tenderness and the violence, the wedding and the honeymoon, returning to Mergellina under the new identity of Mrs. Lina Carraci—everything seemed to have been pushed into the river.\n[1966-11-20T10:00:00] Mercato | I noticed the room had a terrible smell, and the bathroom door wouldn't close properly. I thought she had not only failed to find a sense of connection, but had become increasingly distant.\n[1966-11-20T10:05:00] Mercato | I thought to myself, Saint John was like an extension of our Mergellina for her, even though she had been saved, she didn't watch where she was stepping, and she fell into a deep pit.\n[1966-11-20T10:10:00] Mercato | I saw little Rino and it immediately made her worried. The child was usually carefree and cheerful, but now he would cry during the day and wanted Stefano; he would also cry when he woke up at night.\n[1966-11-20T10:15:00] Mercato | I saw how my mother's attention, and the games she played with him, no longer interested him. I thought of those games that had become annoying to him.\n[1966-11-20T10:20:00] Mercato | I saw Lina come up with some new games again; her eyes lit up once more. The children would come over and kiss her, reaching out to touch her chest, and they would call out happily.\n[1966-11-20T10:25:00] Mercato | I saw him, but later he would push my mother away and play by himself, or take a nap on a blanket on the floor.\n[1966-11-20T10:30:00] Porto | I saw that if I took him out, he'd get tired after just a few steps, saying his knees hurt and asking to be carried by his mother. If she refused, he would cry and scream, rolling on the ground.\n[1966-11-20T10:35:00] Mercato | I saw that at first, Lina was able to stick to her principles, but gradually she began to make concessions.\n[1966-11-20T22:00:00] Mercato | I saw that in the evening, to calm him down, she let him come to her small bed and sleep with her.\n[1966-11-21T10:00:00] Porto | When I saw them going out to do some shopping together, Lina would carry the child. I thought he was a strong, solid child, heavy to hold.\n[1966-11-21T11:00:00] Mercato | I saw the final result: she was carrying her bag in one hand and holding him in the other, and when she got home, she was completely exhausted.\n[1966-11-25T10:00:00] Mercato | I saw her once again experience what it was like to live without money, unable to buy books, and without newspapers or magazines. I knew all the things she brought were basically for her son, but this child was growing up fast, and those clothes were already too small.\n[1966-11-25T10:05:00] Mercato | I know she doesn't have many clothes of her own, but Enzo works hard every day and gives her the money she needs. However, his earnings are meager, and he also has to give money to his relatives who are taking care of several of his younger brothers and sisters.\n[1966-11-25T10:10:00] Mercato | I know they can barely afford the rent, electricity, and gas bills. I thought about it, but Lina wasn't worried at all. The money she had once had, the money she had squandered, and the poverty of her childhood merged in her mind, all blending into something that didn't really make a difference—whether she had money or not, it was all the same.\n[1966-11-25T10:15:00] Mercato | I saw her trying to get her son back to his previous state: full of energy, quick to respond, and well-behaved. I thought that what she seemed to worry about most was being unable to continue the education she had given her son.\n[1966-11-25T16:00:00] Staircase landing | I saw that little Rino now seems to like only playing on the stairs with the neighbor's kids.\n[1966-11-25T16:05:00] Stair landing | I saw them arguing, fighting, laughing, and eating all sorts of messy things. I thought, but it looked very happy.\n[1966-11-25T16:10:00] Mercato | I saw Lina watching her son from the kitchen window, playing outside the stairwell with other children. I thought to myself, he's great, smarter than the other child, even though that child is older.\n[1966-11-25T16:15:00] Mercato | I thought maybe I should accept this reality—I couldn't keep him forever in a glass case. I had already provided him with the necessary conditions, but from now on, he would have to rely on himself.\n[1966-11-25T16:20:00] Mercato | I thought about how he now had to fight other kids, steal things from them, and end up all dirty.\n[1966-12-05T15:00:00] Stair landing | I saw one day that Stefano appeared on the staircase landing, having left Capodimonte, and decided to come and see his son.\n[1966-12-05T15:05:00] Staircase landing | I saw little Rino, and she was happy to see him, played with him for a while, but Lina noticed her husband was getting annoyed, he was eager to leave.\n[1966-12-05T15:10:00] Staircase landing | I look at him now, and he checks his watch from time to time and yawns. I know that in the past, he acted as if he couldn't live without her and the children. I thought it was almost certain that he had come here because of his mother, or perhaps even because of Pinocchia.\n[1966-12-05T15:15:00] Stair landing | I thought that love, jealousy, all of it was past now, and he felt nothing at all.\n[1966-12-05T15:20:00] Staircase landing | I heard, \"I'll take the child for a walk.\" \"He always wants to be held.\"\n[1966-12-05T15:25:00] Stair landing | I heard, \"I'll hold him.\" \"Don't hold him, let him walk on his own.\" \"I want to hold him, so I will.\"\n[1966-12-05T16:00:00] Stair landing | I saw them leave, and they came back half an hour later. He said he had to go back to Capodimonte right away.\n[1966-12-05T16:05:00] Staircase landing | I saw him swear that the child had always been well-behaved, hadn't asked to be held, and before leaving, he said to Lina. \"I heard, 'I saw everyone here calls you Mrs. Lina.'\"\n[1966-12-05T16:10:00] Stair landing | \"I'm Mrs. Lina.\" \"I didn't kill you, I won't kill you, because you're my son's mother. You and your damned friend, you're really bold, almost...\"\n[1966-12-05T16:15:00] Staircase landing | I saw Lina smile, which prompted him to speak. I heard, \"Looking at your conduct, you only pick on people who can fight back.\"\n[1966-12-05T16:20:00] Stair landing | I saw and then she understood that her husband was talking about the Solara brothers. When Stefano came down the stairs, she shouted at him from the stairwell. I heard, \"You tell Michele that if he shows up here, I'll spit in his face.\"\n[1966-12-05T16:25:00] Staircase landing | I saw that Stefano didn't respond, and then he disappeared from the road.\n[1966-12-20T10:00:00] Dormitory 4 | I remember that on the eve of Christmas in 1966, I came down very seriously ill with a cold, and I called one of the neighbors at my parents' house. I knew that in our Mergellina, someone had finally installed a telephone.\n[1966-12-20T10:05:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw her making me tell her about my parents. I heard, \"I won't be able to go back for Christmas.\"\n[1966-12-22T10:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw that in the following days, I started to have a high fever and kept coughing. I saw that the dormitory was getting more and more empty, and quieter and quieter. I thought I couldn't eat anything, and couldn't even drink.\n[1966-12-24T09:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I remember one morning, I was exhausted, half-awake, lying in bed, when I heard someone speaking loudly in our local dialect. I saw women just like those in Mergellina, shouting at each other through the windows.\n[1966-12-24T09:05:00] Dormitory 004 | I heard my mother's footsteps, and she burst in without knocking, holding a bunch of bags. I heard that voice, one I was intimately familiar with, etched into my mind.\n[1966-12-24T09:10:00] Dormitory 004 | I know she rarely left our Mergellina, maybe just to the city of San Gregorio Armeno, as far as I know, she had never been outside of San Gregorio Armeno. I found it absolutely unbelievable.\n[1966-12-24T09:15:00] Dormitory Borgo | Even though it was like that, she still sat on the train all night and brought me the Christmas food I had prepared in advance, which she had made specially for me.\n[1966-12-24T09:20:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw her speaking in a harsh, commanding tone, as if she wanted me to recover immediately, as if a miracle would happen and I could leave with her that evening back to San Gregorio Armeno. I know because she has to go back right away; there's my father and other children at home.\n[1966-12-24T09:25:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw her shouting as she moved things around the room, carrying them with no care at all. I thought about how I was worried the dorm supervisor might come over, and in addition to my fever, I would have to endure her. I felt like I was going to pass out.\n[1966-12-24T09:30:00] Dormitory 004 | I saw myself closing my eyes, hoping to sink into that dazed darkness, and that she wouldn't follow. I thought, but there was nothing I could do to stop her. She kept pacing back and forth in the room, domineering yet kind-hearted.\n[1966-12-24T10:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw her and she told me about my father, my brothers and sisters, and our neighbors, of course, and about Pinocchio, Pinocchio, Giggia, and Lina.\n[1966-12-24T10:05:00] Dormitory Borgo | I tried to avoid listening to what she was saying, but she kept talking insistently. I heard, \"You don't know what she did! You don't know what happened!\"\n[1966-12-24T10:10:00] Dormitory Borgo | I would always come over to shake her arm or a foot in the bed. I realized that being sick had made me extremely vulnerable, and in this state, I was more sensitive than usual, especially to things I couldn't stand even under normal circumstances.\n[1966-12-24T10:15:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw her constantly talking about what my peers were doing, and compared to them, she thought I was a failure. I thought about how angry I was.\n[1966-12-24T10:20:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw and I whispered. I heard, \"Don't say anything.\"\n[1966-12-24T10:25:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw it, but she didn't care at all; she kept repeating it over and over. I heard, \"You, you're different from them!\"\n[1966-12-24T10:30:00] Dormitory Borgo | The thing that made me feel the worst was that I sensed, behind her pride as a mother, a hidden fear—that everything was always changing, and she feared I would lose my advantage, leaving her with no more reason to boast.\n[1966-12-24T10:35:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw her forcing me to eat, wiping my sweat, and taking my temperature countless times. I thought she didn't believe in the stability of this world at all. Was she afraid that if I died, she would lose a trophy?\n[1966-12-24T10:40:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought about how she feared that if she wasn't so strong, if she gave in, if she didn't pull herself together, she would have to return to Mergellina in disgrace.\n[1966-12-24T10:45:00] Dormitory Borgo | I kept seeing her talk about Lina to me, emphasizing it so many times. I thought about how I had suddenly realized that she had always cared deeply about Lina, ever since Lina was a child.\n[1966-12-24T10:50:00] Dormitory 004 | I thought, even my mother realized that Lina was better than me. Now I've left Lina behind, and that makes her feel proud.\n[1966-12-24T10:55:00] Dormitory 004 | I thought about her, but she was anxious. She was afraid of losing her position as the luckiest mother in the entire Mergellina. Look at her, how competitive she is! Look how proud she is!\n[1966-12-24T11:00:00] Dormitory 004 | I thought about how I could sense the energy surrounding me. I thought, her limp made her life more difficult than others', requiring more effort, which made her behave with an unusual brutality both inside and outside the home.\n[1966-12-24T11:05:00] Dormitory Borgo | I know what kind of man my father is? A very weak little man who has become accustomed to groveling. He carefully extends his hand just for a few cents. I thought about how he couldn't break through any obstacles to get into this highly secured building, but my mother did.",

    "text": "[1966-12-24T20:00:00] Dormitory 004 | I breathed a sigh of relief after she left. I saw the room grow quiet. I felt moved because of my fever.\n[1966-12-24T20:05:00] Dormitory 004 | I thought of her, imagining her asking someone for directions, wondering how to get to the train station, limping with her faulty leg, walking alone in this unfamiliar city.\n[1966-12-24T20:10:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought she wouldn't spend money on a bus; she had always been careful, never wasting a single cent. But she still managed to do it: she would buy the right ticket, board the right train, and sit in an extremely uncomfortable seat all night, or stand all the way to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1966-12-24T20:15:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought about San Gregorio Armeno, how she still had a long way to go, how she would walk all the way to our Mergellina, then continue cleaning the house, cooking, cutting up the big eels, and preparing a big salad, chicken soup, and egg cake.\n[1966-12-24T20:20:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought about how, in her mind, there was always something that gave her comfort: Elena was more successful than Giggia, Pinochietta, Pinochietta, Lina, and all the other girls.\n[1967-01-15T10:00:00] Borgo | I know that in my final year at Borgo, I completely changed my view of the previous three years. I thought about how I no longer liked this city, and all those male classmates, female classmates, professors, and exams.\n[1967-01-15T10:05:00] Borgo | I thought about how I didn't like the cold weather here, and I had lost interest in the political meetings held on warm evenings beneath the baptistery, as well as the movies shown by the film club.\n[1967-01-15T10:10:00] Borgo | I saw everything and felt the whole city had become lifeless: Tornabuoni Building, Arno River, May 26th Street, Saint Ficarino Street, Knights' Square, Saint Lawrence Street.\n[1967-01-15T10:15:00] Borgo | I thought of the streets, still the same streets. Even though the baker on the street greeted me and the newsstand seller talked about the weather with me, I remained an outsider. The accent I tried so hard to imitate still sounded so foreign.\n[1967-01-15T10:20:00] Borgo | I saw the colors of the stone buildings, trees, clouds, sky, and road signs. I thought about everything and found it all unfamiliar.\n[1967-01-15T10:25:00] Borgo | I thought that, even after reading those notes and before throwing away the box containing them, I had already stepped out of those words, but I still couldn't be sure whether my terrible feelings were caused by Lina's notes.\n[1967-01-15T10:30:00] Borgo | I thought about the shock I experienced when I first arrived in this city, as if facing a fierce battle. I remembered the anxious heartbeats during every exam, and the joy of always scoring full marks.\n[1967-01-15T10:35:00] Borgo | I saw myself correcting my voice, my movements, and the way I dressed and walked. I thought of it as if I had joined a acting competition, seeing who could perform better. After wearing that mask for so long, it had almost become my face.\n[1967-01-15T10:40:00] Borgo | I thought suddenly, and I became aware of that \"almost\" feeling: Did I do it? I almost did it; did I get rid of San Gregorio Armeno, of that ruined Mergellina? I almost got rid of it.\n[1967-01-15T10:45:00] Borgo | I wondered if I had new friends now? Both boys and girls, all from intellectual families, more cultured than Teacher Galiani and her children? Probably.\n[1967-01-15T10:50:00] Borgo | I wondered whether, after all those exams, I had won the favor of my teachers, even the most strict ones? Almost.\n[1967-01-15T10:55:00] Borgo | I thought about the \"almost\" things behind which I had seen the truth, and I felt fear. My fear was like the feeling I had on the first day I arrived at Borgo—I was afraid of those truly cultured people, those who were calm and at ease.\n[1967-01-15T11:00:00] Borgo | I knew there were many people like her at Borgo Normal University, not just those who did well in Latin, Greek, or history exams.\n[1967-01-15T11:05:00] Borgo | I know they were all very young, almost all boys, like the famous professors and the notable people who had attended this university before them. They stood out because they knew where they were going, and their purpose in studying was clear.\n[1967-01-15T11:10:00] Borgo | I know that this can be seen through their families, or through their explicit areas of research.\n[1967-01-15T11:15:00] Borgo | I know they know how to run a newspaper or a magazine, how to manage a publishing house, how television or radio broadcasts work, how to shoot a movie, how university teaching ranks are structured, and what exists in the city, the countryside, beyond the Alps, and across the sea.\n[1967-01-15T11:20:00] Borgo | I thought about how they knew those important people, how they knew whom to admire and whom to look down on, but I didn't know anything. To me, anyone whose name appeared in a newspaper or a book was like a god.\n[1967-01-15T11:25:00] Borgo | I would remain silent or pretend to know what he was talking about, even if someone spoke to me in a tone of admiration or hostility, saying: That's Tezio, that's the son of Caiò, that's the son of Sembene. I thought those must be very important surnames, although I had never heard of them. I didn't know what they had done, and I knew nothing about those celebrities.\n[1967-01-15T11:30:00] Borgo | I remember, for example, that I had prepared very thoroughly for an exam, but if the professor suddenly asked me, \"Do you know which authoritative texts I've drawn upon to teach this course?\" I never know how to respond, but everyone else does, so among them, I'm always worried about saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing.\n[1967-01-15T11:35:00] Borgo | I felt some relief when Franco Mari fell in love with me.\n[1967-01-15T11:40:00] Borgo | I knew he was reeducating me, and I gradually became accustomed to being his subordinate.\n[1967-01-15T11:45:00] Borgo | I know that Franco Mari is a happy man, very attentive to others, but he is also unrestrained and bold, confident, convinced that he has read the right books and holds the correct position. He always speaks in an authoritative tone.\n[1967-01-15T11:50:00] Borgo | I know, and I rarely speak in public, I only express my thoughts in private, I always rely on the authority of Franco Mari. I thought about how I later became very strong, or maybe how I had become very strong.\n[1967-01-15T11:55:00] Borgo | I thought that under the influence of Franco Mari, I could even be more reckless than him, and sometimes more persuasive.\n[1967-01-15T12:00:00] Borgo | I thought about how, despite my great progress, I still worried that I wasn't good enough, worried that I might say the wrong thing, worried that others would discover my ignorance, worried that I didn't know things that were common knowledge.\n[1967-01-15T12:05:00] Borgo | I thought about how, after Franco Mari disappeared from my life, fear once again took hold of me, and I confirmed something I had already known deep down.\n[1967-01-15T12:10:00] Borgo | I knew about his wealth, his good upbringing, his reputation as a left-wing representative among students, his wide social circle, and even the courage he showed when criticizing authority figures inside and outside the school. All of this made him radiate an aura wherever he went. I thought about how, as his girlfriend or partner, this aura naturally reflected onto me. It could almost be said that just the fact that he loved me was public proof of my worth.\n[1967-01-15T12:15:00] Borgo | I know, but after he was expelled from school, from that moment on, my image began to fade, and my classmates no longer surrounded me.\n[1967-01-15T12:20:00] Borgo | I saw that the well-born classmates no longer invited me to go out with them on weekends, or to attend parties, and some even started mocking my Mask Loc 001 accent.\n[1967-01-15T12:25:00] Borgo | I saw that the clothes Franco Mari had given me in the past had also gone out of style, and now looked old on me. I thought to myself that I would soon realize Franco Mari had appeared in my life, masking my true situation, but not changing it— I still couldn't truly fit into this environment.\n[1967-01-15T12:30:00] Borgo | I know I'm the kind of person who studies hard every day and night, the kind of student who gets praised and recognized by my classmates, but I'll never be able to reach a truly high level.\n[1967-01-15T12:35:00] Borgo | I thought I would always be afraid: afraid of saying the wrong thing, afraid of speaking too loudly, afraid of dressing inappropriately, afraid of appearing vulgar, afraid of not having real thoughts.\n[1967-01-15T12:40:00] Borgo | I know I have to say that during that time, my oppression had another reason.\n[1967-01-15T12:45:00] Borgo | I know everyone knows that I went to Franco Mari's room in the Piazza dei Cavalieri at night, and that I went to Paris with him, and to Vesciglia. I thought to myself that everyone probably saw me as a frivolous girl.\n[1967-01-15T12:50:00] Borgo | I know I have embraced the idea of sexual liberation, but the price I have paid for it is beyond words.\n[1967-01-15T12:55:00] Borgo | I thought Franco Mari was a strong advocate of sexual liberation, so I tried hard to hide my traditional side, wanting to appear open-minded in front of him, without any prejudice.\n[1967-01-15T13:00:00] Borgo | I know he thought the most despicable women were those who pretended to be proper, the girls from bourgeois families who would rather give up their bodies than do what they should. I thought about how I couldn't go around spreading the ideas he had imparted to me like the Gospels.\n[1967-01-15T13:05:00] Borgo | I know I have a friend in San Gregorio Armeno. She got married at sixteen, had an affair at eighteen, became pregnant by her lover, and then went back to her husband. Who knows what she might do next. I thought I couldn't tell them either.\n[1967-01-15T13:10:00] Borgo | I thought, in the end, I felt as if I had been intimate with Franco Mari, which was nothing compared to Lina's turbulent life.\n[1967-01-15T13:15:00] Borgo | I saw I had to endure the backhanded remarks of the girls and the disgusting teasing from the boys. I saw and felt their eyes lingering on my full chest.\n[1967-01-15T13:20:00] Borgo | I saw myself having to firmly push away the guys who stood in front of me, openly claiming they would replace my ex-boyfriend. After I rejected them, those boys would attack me with very vulgar words, and I had no choice but to swallow my anger.\n[1967-01-15T13:25:00] Borgo | I saw myself gritting my teeth and moving forward, I told myself: This will all end!\n[1967-01-15T15:00:00] Stair landing | I saw him come again later, maybe four or five times at most.",

    "text": "[1967-02-01T10:00:00] Borgo | I saw myself working nonstop on my thesis,pesterin gPietro, and reading him aloud the parts I had written.\n[1967-02-01T10:05:00] Borgo | I saw him always being polite, shaking his head and casually quoting Virgil or some other ancient author, saying that it might be useful to me.\n[1967-02-01T10:10:00] Borgo | I saw myself writing down everything he said, then putting it into my paper. I thought about it, but I was frustrated. I wavered between two entirely different emotions.\n[1967-02-01T10:15:00] Borgo | I thought about asking for help, but I felt humiliated. I was grateful to Pietro, yet full of hostility, especially when he did everything possible not to make me feel like a burden.\n[1967-02-10T15:00:00] Café | One afternoon, I was leaving a café on Via San Filippo with two girls when a boy who had once been rejected by me loudly called out to me in front of many students, his face serious. I heard, \"San Gregorio Armeno! Don't forget to bring me the sweater you left in your room.\"\n[1967-02-10T15:05:00] Outside the café | I saw myself going out, without saying anything. I heard a wave of laughter behind me.\n[1967-02-10T15:10:00] Street | I saw it, but I quickly realized a boy was following me.\n[1967-02-10T15:15:00] Street | I had already noticed him during class. He looked strange—neither like Nino, that gloomy young scholar, nor like Franco Mari, that cheerful guy. He wore glasses, was very shy, his body somewhat clumsy, and he walked with a slight duckwalk.\n[1967-02-10T15:20:00] University | I saw him following me all the way to the university, and finally he called out to me. I heard the name \"Greco.\"\n[1967-02-10T15:25:00] University | I saw whoever he was, but he knew my name. Out of courtesy, I stopped, and the boy introduced himself. I heard \"Pietro. Pietro.\"\n[1967-02-10T15:30:00] University | I saw it and then he said something incoherent. I heard that he was ashamed of his companions, that he hadn't defended me, and that he hated his own cowardice.\n[1967-02-10T15:35:00] University | I saw myself speaking with a sarcastic tone. I heard, \"Defend what?\"\n[1967-02-10T15:40:00] University | I saw a guy who looked like him, hunched over with thick glasses, a really funny hairstyle, and a completely serious expression, speaking in that typical student way. I thought, and also felt surprised, that he actually believed he should defend me like those young men from our Mergellina, like the French Knights Templar.\n[1967-02-10T15:45:00] University | \"I heard 'Defend your reputation.' 'I don't have a good reputation.'\"\n[1967-02-10T15:50:00] University | I saw him mutter something and then he left. I thought it was a farewell mixed with an apology.\n[1967-02-11T09:00:00] Classroom | I looked for him the next day, and during class I started sitting beside him. We walked together.\n[1967-02-11T09:05:00] Classroom | I saw him, like me, already starting to prepare for his thesis. Like me, he was writing about ancient Rome literature. But unlike me, he didn't call it my \"thesis,\" but rather my \"research.\" Once or twice, he even accidentally said it was his \"book,\" the one he was finishing, which would be published right after graduation. I was surprised by him.\n[1967-02-11T09:10:00] Classroom | I saw that, despite his being only twenty-two, his tone was solemn, and he quoted extensively. I thought about studying? Books? What was he talking about? Acting as if he already had a position at a normal university, or some other institution.\n[1967-02-11T09:15:00] Classroom | I saw something I found hard to believe, and once I asked him. I heard, \"Are you really going to publish your thesis?\"\n[1967-02-11T09:20:00] Classroom | I saw him looking at me with the same puzzled expression. I heard, \"If it's written well, why not?\"\n[1967-02-11T09:25:00] Classroom | I heard, \"Are all well-written papers published?\" \"Why not?\"\n[1967-02-11T09:30:00] Classroom | I saw myself muttering to myself quietly. I heard, \"Perhaps Dionysus would be more interesting than Queen Dido.\" I know he's studying Dionysian worship, and I'm studying the fourth book of the Aeneid.\n[1967-02-11T09:35:00] Classroom | I heard, \"If you know how to study them, all topics are interesting.\"\n[1967-02-11T09:40:00] Borgo | I know we never talked about everyday things, nor did we discuss the possibility of Americans handing over nuclear weapons to the Federal Republic, and we also never talked about the question of whether Fellini or Antonio was better.\n[1967-02-11T09:45:00] Borgo | I knew we didn't talk about any of the things I used to discuss with Franco Mari; we only talked about ancient Mask Loc 014 literature and Greek literature.\n[1967-02-11T09:50:00] Borgo | I know Pietro has an amazing memory: he can effortlessly pull things from different texts as if they were right in front of his eyes, but he never shows off his knowledge or acts conceited. When we talked together, it felt like two people studying ancient Rome literature casually exchanging ideas. The more I interacted with him, the more I realized how outstanding he was.\n[1967-02-11T09:55:00] Borgo | I thought to myself that I would never be as outstanding as him, because in the areas where I was careful and worried about making a mistake and losing face, he was always calm and composed, thoughtful in his every move, never speaking carelessly or recklessly.\n[1967-02-15T10:00:00] Borgo | I saw myself going out with him two or three times, walking along Via Italia, or from the church to the cemetery. I saw once again that my situation had changed.\n[1967-02-15T15:00:00] Spaccanapoli | The thing that made me feel the worst was when I went to a teaching assistant in his forties and showed him my research results; he also advised Pietro's thesis. I know he is a serious and conscientious person, but also a passionate one.\n[1967-02-15T15:05:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_004 | I saw how he treated Pietro, as if Pietro already had his own position at the university, while I was just an ordinary good student. I thought about how often I had refused to talk to this teacher because of anger, pride, or fear of admitting that I was inferior.\n[1967-02-15T15:10:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_004 | I thought to myself, I must do better than Pietro! Although he knows more than I do, he's dark and unimaginative. His research approach and the way he gives me advice are too cautious.\n[1967-02-16T09:00:00] Borgo | I saw a girl I knew one morning, speaking to me in a tone that mixed resentment and jealousy. \"I heard, 'What did you do to those boys? You actually conquered Pietro's son.'\"\n[1967-02-16T09:05:00] Borgo | I didn't know who Pietro's father was, but whenever all my classmates mentioned his name, they did so with respect. Then I began to be invited to parties or to dine out at restaurants again.\n[1967-02-16T09:10:00] Borgo | I thought that maybe they invited me in order for me to also bring Pietro, because he usually came alone, doing his own things, with no interest in group activities.\n[1967-02-16T09:15:00] Borgo | I found out gradually by asking people around me what kind of authoritative figure my new friend's father was. I know he teaches ancient Greek literature at the University of Genoa and is also a high-ranking member of Socialist Party.\n[1967-02-16T09:20:00] Borgo | I thought about how, after receiving this news, I became less lively in Pietro's presence, because I was afraid I might say the wrong thing, or perhaps I had already said something wrong before.\n[1967-02-16T09:25:00] Borgo | I saw that as he continued talking about his own thesis, I spoke less and less about mine. I thought about how I was worried about embarrassing myself by saying the wrong thing.\n[1967-02-26T09:00:00] Dormitory | I remember a Sunday when he ran to my dormitory, out of breath, looking for me, wanting me to have dinner with his family.\n[1967-02-26T09:05:00] Dormitory | I saw him say that his father, mother, and sister would come to the university to see him.\n[1967-02-26T09:10:00] Dormitory | I felt extremely uneasy right away, and I wanted to make myself as beautiful as possible.\n[1967-02-26T09:15:00] Dormitory | I thought to myself: In front of them, I might use the wrong form of the subjunctive, I might be clumsy, they are all wealthy people who have a big car and a private driver.\n[1967-02-26T09:20:00] Dormitory | What would I say? I would surely be dialogueless.",

He was wearing a wrinkled gray suit, had a broad face, and looked very tired, with big glasses. When he took off his hat, I saw that his head was completely bald.\n[1967-02-26T10:10:00] Borgo | I saw his wife, Adele Airota, was a thin woman, not very beautiful, but elegant and refined, her clothing in no way exaggerated.\n[1967-02-26T10:15:00] Borgo | I realized that the car hadn't been driven all the way from Genoa by the driver, but by Mariarosa—Pietro's sister. I saw their car, which was exactly the same as the \"Fiat 1100\" that the Solara brothers had driven before they bought the sports car.\n[1967-02-26T10:20:00] Borgo | I saw her immediately embrace me and kiss my cheek, as if we had known each other for a long time. I saw that she was very beautiful, and her eyes looked intelligent.\n[1967-02-26T10:25:00] Borgo | \"I heard you say, 'You've been driving all the way from Genoa?'\" I asked her. \"Yes, I like to drive.\"\n[1967-02-26T10:30:00] Borgo | I heard, \"Is the driver's license hard to get?\" \"It's not hard at all.\"\n[1967-02-26T10:35:00] Borgo | I know she is twenty-four years old and already teaches art history at Porto University. She specializes in Piero della Francesca.\n[1967-02-26T10:40:00] Borgo | I know she knows everything about me, that is, everything her brother knows—my research interests, for example, she knows, and Professor Pietro and his wife Adele Airota certainly know too.\n[1967-02-26T12:00:00] Borgo | I saw that I had spent a very pleasant morning with them, and they made me feel very at ease.\n[1967-02-26T12:05:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw that they were different from Pietro. I had very broad conversations with his father, mother, and sister.\n[1967-02-26T12:10:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw us having lunch in the hotel restaurant where they were staying, with Professor Pietro and his daughter joking and debating about some political issues. I had heard about these issues from Pasquale, Nino, and Franco Mari, but I actually knew very little about them, and for some things, I knew nothing at all.\n[1967-02-26T12:15:00] Hotel Restaurant | I heard them say things like, \"You've fallen into the trap of class collaboration; you call it a 'trap,' I call it 'mediation'; this mediation only binds the Christian Democratic Party; the politics of the center-left are complicated, if you find it too complicated, you can go back to working for Socialist Party; the country is in a nuclear crisis and urgently needs reform; you know nothing about anything; what would you do if you were standing in our shoes?\"\n[1967-02-26T12:20:00] Hotel Restaurant | \"I heard 'Revolution, revolution, revolution! Revolution can take Italy out of the Middle Ages. If it weren't for our Socialist Party's rule, students talking about sex at school might have been locked up, and people handing out pacifist leaflets on the street might have been locked up too; think about how you treated the North Atlantic Treaty; we've always been against war, against all forms of imperialism; how can you resist America while fighting with the Christian Democratic Party?\"\n[1967-02-26T12:25:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw them speaking quickly and eagerly, debating with enthusiasm, which was probably a habit they had developed over the years.\n[1967-02-26T12:30:00] Hotel Restaurant | I thought about this father and daughter, and saw in them an experience I had never had, one I would never be able to have.\n[1967-02-26T12:35:00] Hotel Restaurant | What is this experience? I can't immediately define it precisely. It might be a skill acquired through training, the ability to make everything in the world my own private affair.\n[1967-02-26T12:40:00] Hotel Restaurant | I know, and I, who can only show off what I know during exams, always get good grades. I thought that this didn't really count as an important ability. It was the way of thinking that mattered most—not just reducing everything to a personal battle, but also the expression of the self.\n[1967-02-26T12:45:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw Mariarosa was friendly, and her father was the same; both of them spoke very seriously. I didn't have even a bit of that exaggerated quality that Nadia or Nino had.\n[1967-02-26T12:50:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw that, when they talked about political issues, their tone was full of passion. When I think about it, whenever I hear people talking about politics in other situations, I always find those conversations cold and pretentious, with no real connection to me.\n[1967-02-26T12:55:00] Hotel Restaurant | I watched as they took turns speaking, exchanging sharp words, talking randomly about the bombing of northern Vietnam, student movements at this university and that university, and the thousands of anti-imperialist bases in Africa and Latin America.\n[1967-02-26T13:00:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw that my daughter seemed to understand the situation better than her father. Mariarosa knew a lot, and when she spoke, she always seemed to have firsthand information.\n[1967-02-26T13:05:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw later, Pietro cast a reproachful glance at his wife, Adele Airota, and said to her daughter. I heard, \"You're the only one who didn't choose dessert.\"\n[1967-02-26T13:10:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw her immediately stop her long-winded dialogue and make a cute face. I heard, \"I'll have a chocolate cake.\"\n[1967-02-26T13:15:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw myself looking at her with admiration. She could drive, she lived in Mask 005, taught at the university, and argued openly with my father without the slightest shame.\n[1967-02-26T13:20:00] Hotel Restaurant | I thought about myself? I was so afraid I couldn't speak, yet I felt ashamed of my silence.\n[1967-02-26T13:25:00] Hotel Restaurant | I couldn't help but say it out loud later. I heard him say, \"After the events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Americans should be tried as criminals against humanity in a military court.\"\n[1967-02-26T13:30:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw a silence fall, and everyone's eyes were on me. Mariarosa said I had spoken well, then reached over and shook my hand.\n[1967-02-26T13:35:00] Hotel Restaurant | I felt encouraged and continued to talk about some things I had heard secondhand.\n[1967-02-26T13:40:00] Hotel Restaurant | I spoke about the planned economy, Socialist Party, and the ups and downs of Christian Democracy, about revolution, Africa, Asia, kindergartens, Piaget, new capitalism, and the tolerance of judges and police, about the remaining Fascist elements within state institutions.\n[1967-02-26T13:45:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw that I was speaking incoherently, without any sense. I saw my heart beating quickly. I thought about how I had forgotten who I was and where I was.\n[1967-02-26T13:50:00] Hotel Restaurant | I saw and felt that the atmosphere around me was friendly, and everyone agreed with what I said. I thought about how happy I was to express my thoughts, and I felt very honored.\n[1967-02-26T13:55:00] Hotel Restaurant | I thought it was especially pleasant that in this lovely family, no one asked me, as people usually do: where I'm from, what my father does, what my mother does. I am myself, I am me, and the family is the family.\n[1967-02-26T16:00:00] Borgo | I spent the entire afternoon chatting with them, and in the evening, before dinner, we took a walk together. Every few steps, Professor Pietro would meet someone he knew, and they would stop to greet each other warmly. We met two university professors and their wives along the way.\n[1967-02-27T09:00:00] Borgo | I thought about it, but by the next day, I had already started to feel uncomfortable. The time I spent with Pietro's parents further proved that the time I had spent at the Borgo Normal University was all in vain.\n[1967-02-27T09:05:00] Borgo | I thought that just having good grades wasn't enough, I needed other things, and I didn't have them. I hadn't learned them, and it was a great shame!\n[1967-02-27T09:10:00] Borgo | I thought about my own excited, confused words, which had no logic or rhythm at all, nothing like Mariarosa's, Adele Airota's, or Pietro's words, which were rigorous and smoothly structured.\n[1967-02-27T09:15:00] Borgo | I saw myself using that pedantic, word-by-word approach, demonstrating it through an exam or through the paper I was writing. I thought, but in reality, I was too naive, too careless. I didn't have the armor they had, the kind that lets you move forward with ease.\n[1967-02-27T09:20:00] Borgo | I thought of Professor Pietro, who seemed like a god to me. Before the battle, he had given his children magical weapons; Mariarosa was invincible, and Pietro himself was unmatched in scholarship. All I could do was stay by their side, reflecting their light.\n[1967-03-01T10:00:00] Borgo | I saw it like that, so I overturned what I had written before and rewrote it, writing in a way that I myself approved of.\n[1967-03-05T10:00:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_004 | When I went to see my advisor and told him my ideas, yes, he praised me, but in a very casual way. I thought, as if I had given my all, but it was nothing more than this.\n[1967-03-05T10:05:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_004 | I thought to myself that I would soon understand: Pietro had a future at the university, but I did not.\n[1967-03-10T11:00:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_004 | I remember that once, I said something very impolite about it, and this teaching assistant was very kind to me, he said. I heard, \"You're a very smart student. Are you planning to teach after graduation?\"\n[1967-03-10T11:05:00] UNIVERSITY 004 | I thought he was saying he was teaching at the university, so I cheered happily, my cheeks turning hot as I said. \"I heard, 'I like teaching, and I also like doing research. I want to continue studying the fourth book of the Aeneid.'\"\n[1967-03-10T11:10:00] UNIVERSITY 004 | I saw him realize immediately that I had misunderstood, and he felt a bit embarrassed. He made an excuse, saying that lifelong learning is a good thing, and he suggested I take an exam held in the fall, which was for the recruitment of the kindergarten teacher's college. I heard him say, \"We need the best teachers to train the best primary school teachers.\" He emphasized his words, encouraging me.",

    "text": "[1967-03-10T11:15:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_004 | I thought about it like that, and I felt ashamed. My arrogance, along with my growing ambition to be as outstanding as Pietro, never stopped increasing.\n[1967-03-10T20:00:00] Borgo | I saw that I was becoming more and more worried about losing Pietro, so I went to find him and clung to him. I realized I had developed feelings for him, and I had been waiting all along for him to confess his love for me.\n[1967-03-10T20:05:00] Borgo | I saw one night, I kissed him, pressed my lips against his cheek, and he finally kissed my lips back.\n[1967-03-15T21:00:00] Hidden Place | I saw us starting to meet in some more secluded places, going out at night, waiting for it to get a bit darker. I touched him, and he touched me, but he never wanted to enter me.\n[1967-03-15T21:05:00] Mergellina | I thought to myself that I felt as if I had returned to the stage of being with Antonio, even though they were very different. Going out at night with Pietro's son excited me, and I could draw strength from him.\n[1967-03-20T10:00:00] Borgo | I sometimes wanted to find a public phone and call Lina. I wanted to tell her that I now have a new boyfriend, and I'm almost certain our graduation thesis will be published, turned into a book.\n[1967-03-20T10:05:00] Borgo | I thought of telling her that we both could end up teaching at the university, because her sister Mariarosa was already teaching there at twenty-four.\n[1967-03-20T10:10:00] Borgo | I wanted to tell her: Lina, you're right. If you learn something from a young age, you'll be confident in every aspect when you grow up, as if you were born knowing it. But in the end, I gave up.\n[1967-03-20T10:15:00] Borgo | Why did I call her? Just to silently listen to what was happening in her life? If she were to listen to me, what would I tell her?\n[1967-03-20T10:20:00] Borgo | I thought to myself that I clearly knew that whatever had happened to Pietro would never happen to me.\n[1967-03-20T10:25:00] Borgo | I saw the two of us sitting together in the dark alley, on the grass. I thought, especially knowing that he would disappear from my life like Franco Mari. Anyway, it was probably good that it ended this way, because I didn't love him, just so I wouldn't be so scared.\n[1967-03-20T15:00:00] Staircase landing | I saw him for the last time when he met his wife, shouting at her angrily. I heard, \"You're a disgrace to your family. Your mother doesn't even want to see you anymore.\"\n[1967-03-20T15:05:00] Stair landing | I heard, \"That's because they don't understand what kind of life I and you are living.\" \"I treat you like a queen.\" \"I'd rather be a beggar.\"\n[1967-03-20T15:10:00] Stair Landing | \"I heard, 'If you [become pregnant], you must [abort], because officially you're still my wife. I don't want a child born to you who would take my name.'\"\n[1967-03-20T15:15:00] Stair landing | I heard, \"I won't have any other children.\" \"Why? Have you already decided not to bother?\" \"Go to hell.\"\n[1967-03-20T15:20:00] Stair landing | I heard, \"I've already greeted you.\" \"In any case, little Rino isn't your son, but he still takes your name.\"\n[1967-03-20T15:25:00] Stair landing | I heard, \"You bitch, if you keep saying things like that, it's really over. I'll never want to see you again, nor him.\"\n[1967-03-20T15:30:00] Stair landing | I realized that, in truth, he had always been certain that little Rino was his son. But he was pretending, driven by an opportunistic thought—he preferred to live a quiet life, and he wanted to keep himself from the emotional turmoil Lina caused.\n[1967-04-01T20:00:00] Mercato | I saw Lina carefully describe to Enzo her husband's visit, and Enzo would listen very attentively, rarely offering any comments.\n[1967-04-01T20:05:00] Mercato | I know he's a man of few words; he never told Lina anything about his work, what he did in the factory, whether he was happy or not.\n[1967-04-01T20:10:00] Mercato | I watched as she finished dinner, played with the children for a while, and listened to Lina talk. I know he left home at six in the morning and came back at seven in the evening.\n[1967-04-01T20:15:00] Mercato | I saw that whenever Lina said the child needed something, the next day he would find a way to get the money needed.\n[1967-04-01T20:20:00] Mercato | I saw him looking at her, and he never once told her she should go to Stefano for money, to support the child, he never once told her she should get a job. I thought that his only reason for living was to come home at night and sit in the kitchen with her, listening to her talk.\n[1967-04-01T21:00:00] Mercato | I saw him stand up at last and lock himself in the bedroom. I heard the words \"Good night.\"\n[1967-04-10T21:00:00] Hidden Place | I saw our only commonality was our mutual affection in the darkness when it got dark. I thought he would rub against me and pant, but he didn't ask for anything more.\n[1967-04-20T10:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I felt so oppressed that for a while I couldn't continue writing my thesis. I looked at the lines of text on the page, but I couldn't make sense of a single word.\n[1967-04-20T10:10:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw myself lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about what to do. I thought that in the end, I would give in, and after graduation, I would return to my birthplace, back to that Mergellina, and teach at a secondary school.\n[1967-04-20T10:15:00] Dormitory 004 | I wanted to be a middle school teacher, yes, higher in rank than Teacher Oliviero, on par with Teacher Galiani, or perhaps just slightly lower, like Teacher Greco.\n[1967-04-20T10:20:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought that in Mergellina, everyone would see me as an important person, the daughter of a gatekeeper, who was eager to learn from a young age and eventually succeeded in her studies.\n[1967-04-20T10:25:00] Dormitory Borgo | I realized that only after becoming familiar with Borgo, after meeting those important professors, after meeting Pietro, Mariarosa, and their father, did I clearly understand that I couldn't go very far.\n[1967-04-20T10:30:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought about the great effort I had made, the many hopes and beautiful moments I had experienced, and I would always cherish the wonderful time I spent with Franco Mari.\n[1967-04-20T10:35:00] Dormitory Borgo | I think back to those years, to those happy times, and how wonderful it was being with him. At the time, I didn't realize how important he was. Now, I'm becoming more and more depressed.\n[1967-04-20T10:40:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw rain, snow, and cold days, the breath of spring along the Arno Riverbank, the city's flower-filled paths, and the warmth passed on to us. We went together to choose clothes and glasses, and he took great interest in improving me.\n[1967-04-20T10:45:00] Dormitory Borgo | I know we're in Paris, on this exciting trip abroad, in cafés, politics, literature. Although the working class is gradually coming to terms with reality, a revolution is about to come. I thought of him, of his room at night, his body.\n[1967-04-20T10:50:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw that everything had ended, and I lay anxiously on my small bed, unable to fall asleep as I tossed and turned. I thought to myself, maybe I was just deceiving myself—were things really that good?\n[1967-04-20T10:55:00] Dormitory 004 | I thought I clearly knew that at that time, I also felt ashamed, uncomfortable, humiliated, and nauseated. I accepted, endured, and forced myself to do so.\n[1967-04-20T11:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought even the happiest moments couldn't stand up to close scrutiny. Wasn't it possible that everything was just an illusion?!\n[1967-04-20T11:05:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought it was likely that whatever had happened in the darkness of Maronti Beach would soon spread to Franco Mari, even to Pietro, and I didn't want to remember any of it.\n[1967-05-01T10:00:00] Borgo | I noticed that for a while, I saw Pietro less often. I made up an excuse that my thesis was behind schedule and I feared I wouldn't be able to finish on time.\n[1967-05-05T09:00:00] Dormitory 004 | I saw that one morning, I bought a grid notebook and started writing about things that happened to me in Balano in the third person, and also wrote about things that happened in Vomero in the third person.\n[1967-05-05T09:05:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw the end, where I told about San Gregorio Armeno and my life in Mergellina, and I changed the names of people, places, and the background of the story.\n[1967-05-05T09:10:00] Dormitory Borgo | I thought about how the protagonist's life concealed a dark force, an entity that had welded the surrounding world to her body, glowing with the color of a blowtorch's flame, a purplish-blue tip. Every thing she liked would spark and burst forth, but soon fall to the ground, turning into gray clumps that meant nothing.\n[1967-05-15T16:00:00] St. John Street | I saw later that Lina met a man who would have a great impact on her life. One afternoon, she left the child in the care of the female neighbor and went out alone.\n[1967-05-15T16:05:00] St. John Street | I saw her hear the sound of car horns behind her, and someone was waving at her from the car window. I saw that it was a very luxurious car.",

I thought she recognized it as Bruno Socavo's—Nino's friend's wolf-like face.\n[1967-05-15T16:20:00] Saint John Street | I heard him ask, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I live here,\" I said.\n[1967-05-15T16:25:00] Saint John Street | I know that at the time, she didn't talk much about her own life. In those days, these things were hard to explain. She didn't mention Nino, and Bruno didn't either.\n[1967-05-15T16:30:00] St. John Street | I saw her ask if Bruno had graduated from university, and he just said he had decided not to continue his studies.\n[1967-05-15T16:35:00] Saint John Street | I heard, \"Are you married?\" \"No.\"\n[1967-05-15T16:40:00] Saint John Street | I heard, \"Do you have a girlfriend?\" \"Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"\n[1967-05-15T16:45:00] Saint John Street | I heard, \"What are you doing?\" \"Nothing much, someone is working for me.\"\n[1967-05-15T16:50:00] Saint John Street | I saw her almost jokingly ask him. I heard, \"Can you find me a job?\"\n[1967-05-15T16:55:00] St. John Street | \"I heard, 'Getting you a job? Do you really need it?' 'I want to work.'\"\n[1967-05-15T17:00:00] St. John Street | I heard, \"Do you want to be sausage and ham?\" \"Why not?\"\n[1967-05-15T17:05:00] Saint John Street | I heard, \"Where's your husband?\" \"I don't have a husband anymore, but I have a son to raise.\"\n[1967-05-15T17:10:00] St. John Street | I saw Bruno looking at her closely, trying to figure out if she was joking. He was confused and just replied evasively. I heard, \"That's not much of a job.\"\n[1967-05-15T17:15:00] Café | I saw him invite Lina into the café and continue talking about his own things. I know, and then he talked about the many problems that can arise between a couple. His mother had been constantly arguing with his father, and recently he'd become obsessed with a married woman, but she dumped him.\n[1967-05-15T17:45:00] Café | I saw that in the end Lina said she was leaving, and Bruno asked her. I heard, \"You really left your husband? You really have a child?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1967-05-15T17:50:00] Café | I saw him frowning and writing something on a napkin. I heard, \"You go find this man, he'll be there starting at eight in the morning. Have him look at this.\"\n[1967-05-15T17:55:00] Café | I saw Lina smile awkwardly. I heard, \"This napkin?\" \"Yes.\" \"That's enough?\"\n[1967-05-15T18:00:00] Café | I saw and heard the mocking tone in her voice, and he nodded, suddenly becoming shy, muttering something under his breath. I heard, \"That was a very beautiful summer.\"\n[1967-05-15T18:05:00] Café | I heard her say, \"It's the same for me too.\"\n[1967-05-25T10:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I saw that I had spent twenty days writing this story, and during that time I hadn't met anyone, only going out to eat.\n[1967-05-25T10:05:00] Dormitory 004 | I read what I had written again at the end, and I didn't like it at all, so I put it down. I thought I had calmed down a bit, as if that feeling of shame had shifted from me onto the notebook.\n[1967-05-25T10:10:00] Borgo | I saw myself back in my daily life, I quickly finished my paper, and then met with Pietro.\n[1967-06-15T10:00:00] Borgo | I was moved by his friendliness and the encouragement he gave me.\n[1967-06-20T10:00:00] Borgo | When I saw him graduate, everyone came, including many of his parents' friends from Borgo. I thought, to my surprise, that I no longer felt any hostility toward everything Pietro was facing, nor toward his life plan.\n[1967-06-20T10:05:00] Borgo | I saw the opposite, and I was happy he was so lucky. I was very grateful to his family for inviting me to their celebration, especially Mariarosa, who took such good care of me. I thought about how we had passionately discussed the provisional government established by the Greek Fascist.\n[1967-07-05T10:00:00] Borgo | I saw that I was in the second batch of graduation defenses, and I didn't tell my parents. I thought about how I was worried that my mother felt obligated to come celebrate for me.\n[1967-07-05T10:05:00] Borgo | I saw myself wearing the clothes Franco Mari bought for me to attend the defense. I thought that the dress was acceptable, and after a long time, I finally felt satisfied with myself.\n[1967-07-05T10:10:00] Borgo | I know that by the time I was twenty-three, I had already graduated from university with a degree in literature, and I graduated with a perfect score of 110 out of 100.\n[1967-07-05T10:15:00] Borgo | I know my father only went to the fifth grade of elementary school, and my mother only reached the second grade. As far as I know, none of my ancestors ever seriously studied or wrote. I thought to myself that I had really done something remarkable.\n[1967-07-05T13:00:00] Borgo | I saw that Pietro had also come to celebrate with me, besides a few of the girls in our class. I saw that I remembered the day was very hot.\n[1967-07-05T17:00:00] Dormitory Borgo | I had attended the school's ceremony and rituals, and I returned to my room to rest for a while, putting down my thesis.\n[1967-07-05T18:00:00] Dormitory 004 | I saw him waiting for me downstairs; he wanted to take me to dinner.\n[1967-07-05T18:05:00] Dormitory Borgo | I looked at myself in the mirror and felt beautiful. I took the book that contained the story and stuffed it into my bag.\n[1967-07-05T19:00:00] Restaurant | I know that was Pietro's first time taking me to a restaurant. Franco Mari used to take me there often; he taught me where to place the utensils and glasses.\n[1967-07-05T19:05:00] Restaurant | I heard Pietro ask me, \"Are we boyfriend and girlfriend?\"\n[1967-07-05T19:10:00] Restaurant | I saw myself smiling and saying, \"I don't know.\" I heard him take a box from his pocket and hand it to me, whispering, \"For the past year, I've thought of myself as your boyfriend. If you don't feel the same way, just think of it as a graduation gift.\"\n[1967-07-05T19:15:00] Restaurant | I saw myself tearing open the package, revealing a green box inside which was a ring with a small diamond. I heard \"Very beautiful.\" I said.\n[1967-07-05T19:20:00] Restaurant | I tried it on and found that the size fit perfectly. I thought of Stefano's engagement ring for Lina, which was much more luxurious than this one.\n[1967-07-05T19:25:00] Restaurant | I know, but it was the first piece of jewelry I had ever received. Franco Mari had given me many things, but never any jewelry. The only jewelry I owned was my mother's silver bracelet.\n[1967-07-05T19:30:00] Restaurant | I saw what I said to him. I heard, \"We are boyfriend and girlfriend.\"\n[1967-07-05T19:35:00] Restaurant | I saw and then leaned over the table, [intimate gesture] his lips.\n[1967-07-05T19:40:00] Restaurant | I saw him turn red and he spoke in a low voice. \"I heard, 'I have one more gift.'\"\n[1967-07-05T19:45:00] Restaurant | I saw him give me an envelope, which contained a manuscript of his thesis. I thought, how fast he is! I even found it very pleasant to think so.\n[1967-07-05T19:50:00] Restaurant | \"I have a little gift for you,\" I said. \"What?\"\n[1967-07-05T19:55:00] Restaurant | I heard, \"Something insignificant, but I don't know what to give you that truly belongs to me.\"\n[1967-07-05T20:00:00] Restaurant | I saw myself taking the notebook out of my bag and handing it to him.\n[1967-07-05T20:05:00] Restaurant | \"I heard 'it's a novel,' I said, 'the only version, the only attempt, I'll never write again.'\"\n[1967-07-05T20:10:00] Restaurant | I saw myself smiling as I added. I heard, \"There are a few more daring passages inside.\"\n[1967-07-05T20:15:00] Restaurant | I saw that he seemed a bit uneasy and thanked me, then placed the notebook on the table. I thought about how I would soon regret giving him that notebook.\n[1967-07-05T20:20:00] Restaurant | I knew I thought: He was a serious student with a good family background, about to publish a paper on the worship of Dionysus, and this book would launch his career, and it was handwritten, not typed on a typewriter. I realized I was wrong, and I shouldn't have put him in an awkward situation with a story.\n[1967-07-05T20:25:00] Restaurant | I told him I would attend the job interview for the kindergarten teacher position and that I would return to San Gregorio Armeno. I said our relationship would face great challenges, me in a southern city, him in a northern one. I thought, but even in this situation, I didn't feel uncomfortable. He was he, and I was me.\n[1967-07-05T20:30:00] Restaurant | I saw that Pietro was very serious, his mind was made up.\n[1967-07-05T20:35:00] Restaurant | I saw him explain his plans to me: he needed two years to establish himself at a university, and then he would marry me.\n[1967-07-05T20:40:00] Restaurant | I saw that he had even set a date: September 1969.",

    "text": "[1967-07-05T20:45:00] Outside the Restaurant | I reminded him jokingly as we left the restaurant. I heard, \"Where's my gift?\"\n[1967-07-05T20:50:00] Outside the restaurant | I didn't react at first when I saw him, then I ran back to get it.\n[1967-07-05T21:30:00] On the banks of the Arno River | I saw that we had been walking for a long time. We [intimate gesture], by the Arno River, and he embraced me tightly.\n[1967-07-05T21:35:00] On the Arno River | I saw myself asking him if he wanted to sneak into my room, my tone a bit serious and a bit playful.\n[1967-07-05T21:40:00] On the banks of the Arno River | I saw him shaking his head, then he began to passionately embrace me.\n[1967-07-05T21:45:00] On the Arno River | I thought to myself that, even though he and Antonio were separated by the entire library, they were very similar.\n[1967-07-20T10:00:00] Mergellina | I thought about returning to my life at San Gregorio Armeno, that feeling was like someone carrying a broken umbrella in a strong wind, and the umbrella snapped shut above my head.\n[1967-07-20T10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw myself returning to Mergellina in the height of summer. I thought about wanting to find a job right away, but my status as a college graduate made it impossible for me to go out and wander around as I had before, taking on odd jobs.\n[1967-07-20T10:10:00] Mergellina | I thought on the other hand, I didn't have any money, and I was too ashamed to ask my parents for it, they had already made great sacrifices for me.\n[1967-07-20T10:15:00] Mergellina | I found myself becoming anxious very quickly, everything annoyed me—the streets, the main roads, the small parks, and those ugly houses. Even though at first, every blade of grass, every scent moved me.\n[1967-07-20T10:20:00] Mergellina | I thought, what would I do if Pietro had chosen someone else, if I couldn't pass the exam? I couldn't stay here forever, with these people.\n[1967-07-20T10:25:00] Mergellina | I know that my parents and my brothers and sisters are proud of me, and I can feel it. I wondered what they would do with the fact that I had graduated, why I had come back, and how they would act in front of the neighbors, pretending that I was the pride of the whole family.\n[1967-07-20T10:30:00] Mergellina | I thought, if I really think about it, I've only added to their burden. I've made this small house even more crowded, and setting up a bed at night has become a problem. I've caused them trouble in their daily lives.\n[1967-07-20T10:35:00] Mergellina | I spent all day reading, standing, or sitting in a corner, moving from one place to another like a useless statue devoted to study, a very proud and troubled person, someone no one should disturb. I thought about it, but undoubtedly, they were all wondering one thing: what was she planning to do?\n[1967-07-20T10:40:00] The Old Library | I saw my mother could no longer hold back, and she asked me about my boyfriend. Actually, I had never mentioned him, she deduced it from the ring on my hand.\n[1967-07-20T10:45:00] Mergellina | I could see she wanted to know what my boyfriend did for a living, how much he earned, and when he would come to our house to ask for my hand in marriage. I also wondered where we would live after I got married.\n[1967-07-20T10:50:00] Mergellina | I told her, at the beginning, some information: he was a university teacher, but didn't have a salary yet, couldn't earn any money, he was about to publish a book, other teachers thought it was a very important book, we would get married in a couple of years, his parents lived in Genoa, and we might live in that city or in the city where he worked.\n[1967-07-20T10:55:00] Mergellina | I still ask her the same question whenever I see her. I thought, but by the way she looked at me, I felt she hadn't heard a word I said—she had too many preconceived notions.\n[1967-07-20T11:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her become as irritable as usual. She could no longer curse at me the way she used to before. She tried hard to control her irritation, perhaps because she felt she had no more reason to be upset with me. I thought about how I was engaged to a man who had never even proposed to me, a man living far away, who taught but didn't earn much, who would publish a book but wasn't well known.\n[1967-07-20T11:05:00] Mergellina | I realized that, in reality, language itself had become something foreign. I expressed myself in a language too complex for her, even though I tried to speak in the dialect. When I found out she didn't understand, I simplified my words, but those simplified sentences felt unnatural and chaotic.\n[1967-07-20T11:10:00] Mergellina | I saw people on the road, in the stores, in the stairwells of the houses, looking at me with a mixture of respect and disdain. Behind my back, they all called me the \"Borgo woman.\" I thought about how I had tried so hard to erase my San Gregorio Armeno accent, but it hadn't convinced Borgo, yet my accent was something my mother, father, my brothers and sisters, even the whole Mergellina, could sense.\n[1967-07-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that during that time, I wrote some very long letters to Pietro, and his replies to me were even longer.\n[1967-07-25T10:05:00] Mergellina | I thought at first that he would mention the notebook I showed him, but later I even forgot about it myself.\n[1967-07-25T10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw that in our letters we never talked about any specific things, and I still keep those letters to this day: there were no useful details in them to reconstruct daily life at the time, like the price of a loaf of bread, or a movie ticket, or how much the concierge or teacher earned in a month.\n[1967-07-25T10:15:00] Mergellina | As far as I know, we all focused on discussing a book he had read, or an interesting article about our field of study, the things he or I was thinking about, and also on student movements and some new avant-garde issues—I didn't understand these, but he did.\n[1967-07-25T10:20:00] Mergellina | I saw that he wrote to me: \"I would like to write a small book using the words on those discarded sheets of paper—the ones you wrote a paragraph on, then thought unsatisfactory and threw into the waste basket.\"\n[1967-07-25T10:25:00] Mergellina | I saw \"I'm collecting these materials, and I want to print them just as they are, keeping the torn marks, the lines drawn casually on the draft, the places where it was interrupted, and the traces of being folded randomly. Maybe this is the only possible literature we have now.\"\n[1967-07-25T10:30:00] Mergellina | The last sentence really shook me. I doubted it, and I remember thinking at the time that he was trying to tell me in this way that he had read the notebook I had given him, the story I had given him, and that he thought it was an out-of-place work.\n[1967-08-01T14:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that during those weeks, the weather remained consistently hot. I thought of the body that had made me study tirelessly for years, and I felt completely exhausted, with no strength left.\n[1967-08-01T15:00:00] Mergellina | I searched everywhere for news about Professor Oliviero, hoping she was still alive so I could see her. I thought about how I could make her satisfied through my academic achievements, in order to gain a little bit of energy.\n[1967-08-01T15:05:00] Mergellina | I learned from my sister that the teacher's sister came to take her to live in Potenza.\n[1967-08-01T15:10:00] Mergellina | I thought about how lonely I felt, and I began to miss Lina. I thought about how completely different our lives were, and I wanted to go find her, to see just how far apart we really were.\n[1967-08-01T15:15:00] Mergellina | I saw her, but I didn't do anything. I just casually mentioned her to the people at Mergellina, wanting to know what people thought of her, what gossip they spread.\n[1967-08-05T10:00:00] Mergellina | I went to find Antonio first, but he wasn't in Mergellina. They said he might have stayed in Germany. I know some people say he married a very beautiful German woman, a tall, voluptuous, genuine blonde with blue eyes, and they had twins.",

    "text": "[1967-08-05T11:00:00] Martiri Square | I went to chat with Alfonso Carracci, and I often went to his store in Piazza Martiri.\n[1967-08-05T11:05:00] Shoe Store | I saw him becoming increasingly handsome, handsome like a Spanish nobleman. He spoke very refined Italian, interwoven with some pleasant regional dialect words.\n[1967-08-05T11:10:00] Shoe Store | I knew that the Soleara shoe store was doing well under his care, his salary satisfied him, and he had rented an apartment in the Tappa district. He didn't miss our Mergellina, his brothers and sisters, or the oily smell in Capodimonte at all.\n[1967-08-05T11:15:00] Shoe Store | I saw, \"Next year I'll be married.\" When he told me, he wasn't full of passion.\n[1967-08-05T11:20:00] Shoe Store | I knew his relationship with Pinocchia had always been stable, and now he needed to take the final step.\n[1967-08-05T11:25:00] Shoe Store | I sometimes go out with them, and they fit well together. I know she's not as talkative as she used to be. Now she speaks carefully, especially avoiding anything that might offend Alfonso Carracci.\n[1967-08-05T11:30:00] Shoe Store | I had never asked her about her father, mother, or brothers and sisters, and I had never asked about Nino either. She never mentioned him either, as if Nino had completely disappeared from her life.\n[1967-08-06T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself meeting Pasquale and his sister Pinocchia as well. I know that Pasquale is still working as a bricklayer, sometimes at San Gregorio Armeno, sometimes in the suburbs. Pinocchia is still working in the new Capodimonte.\n[1967-08-06T10:05:00] Mergellina | I learned quickly that they all had new relationships. I knew that Pasquale was secretly dating the older daughter of the department store owner, a girl who was still very young; Pinochia was seeing a clerk at the gas station on the main road, a man in his forties who was very kind and deeply loved her.\n[1967-08-07T10:00:00] Pinocchio's House | I saw myself going to Pinocchio. I thought I was already beginning to forget her.\n[1967-08-07T10:05:00] Elena's House | I saw her dressed poorly, thin and irritable, already resigned to her fate, carrying the scars Rino had left on her body. I knew that Rino had been beating her all along to take revenge on Stefano.\n[1967-08-07T10:10:00] Pinocchio's House | What struck me most was the sense of unrelieved misery she carried, which showed clearly in the deep lines around her eyes and mouth.\n[1967-08-08T10:00:00] Lina's Old Residence | I finally worked up the courage to meet Pinocchio as well. I thought about how her situation must be just as bad as I imagined for Pinocchio, because she had no official status.\n[1967-08-08T10:05:00] Lina's Old Residence | I saw her, and she looked very beautiful and happy. I know she now lives in the house where Lina used to live, and she had a daughter named Maria.\n[1967-08-08T10:10:00] Lina's Old Residence | I saw that even during her pregnancy she didn't stop working, and she proudly told me— I also saw it myself—that she was the true owner of two Capodimontes. She ran from one store to another, meddling in everything.\n[1967-08-08T10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw all my childhood friends, and each of them told me something about Lina. Pinocchio seemed to know the most.\n[1967-08-08T10:20:00] Lina's Former Residence | I saw that especially when talking about Lina, she showed the greatest sympathy and affection. I thought she was happy, satisfied with her daughter, her wealthy life, her work, and Stefano. I felt that she truly appreciated Lina for giving her such a happy life.\n[1967-08-08T10:25:00] Lina's Old Residence | I saw her exclaim in an appreciative tone. \"I heard, 'I did something really crazy, I admit it, but Lina and Enzo were even crazier. They didn't care about anything, not even themselves. Their behavior scared me, Stefano, even that bastard Michele.\"\n[1967-08-08T10:30:00] Lina's Old Residence | \"I heard her say, 'She didn't take anything with her! Do you know? She left me all her jewelry! Do you know? She wrote down where she was going on a piece of paper, a very detailed address, including the house number, as if saying: come find us, do whatever you want, who the hell cares!'\"\n[1967-08-08T10:35:00] Lina's Old Residence | I saw her give me the address and I copied it down.\n[1967-08-08T10:40:00] Lina's Old Residence | I saw her when I was writing the address. I heard, \"If you see her, tell her it wasn't me holding Stefano back from seeing the child. He's just too busy, and he's really sorry he can't go. Tell her the Solara brothers haven't forgotten this, especially Michele. Tell her not to trust anyone.\"\n[1967-10-01 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought about how I knew Lina would understand: in the factory, overwork made people not want to make love to their wives or husbands at home, because when they got back, they were completely exhausted and had no desire. But in the factory, at work, they would sometimes feel like making love in the morning or afternoon.\n[1967-10-01 08:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I've seen men take every opportunity to take advantage of you, reaching out to touch you. They use the chance of passing by your side to seduce you.\n[1967-10-01 08:01:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw those women, especially the older ones, laughing as they pressed their full breasts against the men, and they would fall in love. I thought that sex would be a relief from fatigue and boredom, giving a sense of real life.\n[1967-10-05 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | From the first few days of work, those men started to get close to Lina, they stayed very near to her, as if trying to catch her scent.\n[1967-10-05 08:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw Lina push them away, and the men would laugh, singing lewd little songs as they left.\n[1967-10-15 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | One morning, I saw her determined to make her point, and she almost tore a man's ear off because he had said something extremely rude as he passed by her and then forcefully kissed her neck. I knew he was a man in his forties, strong-looking, named Edo, who loved telling dirty jokes and was always clingy with every woman.\n[1967-10-15 08:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw Lina grab his ear with her hand and pull it down with all her strength, her nails digging into his flesh. Although the man was shouting and trying to dodge her punches and kicks, she didn't let go.\n[1967-10-15 08:10:00] Bruno's Office | After seeing what happened, she was furious and rushed to protest at Bruno Socavo's face.\n[1967-10-15 08:10:30] Bruno's Office | I know that since Bruno hired Lina, Lina rarely saw him, and each time was always in a hurry, paying little attention to him.\n[1967-10-15 08:11:00] Bruno's Office | I saw it that time, when she had the chance to look at him carefully. Bruno was standing behind the desk, and he even stood up deliberately, just like a gentleman would when a lady entered the room.\n[1967-10-15 08:11:30] Bruno's Office | I saw the face of Bruno Socavo, swollen and dull-eyed, his chest also broad and fleshy. I was very surprised by Lina's reaction.\n[1967-10-15 08:12:00] Bruno's Office | I saw, especially his face, a bright red like magma, which stood out sharply against his black hair and wolf-like white teeth.\n[1967-10-15 08:12:30] Bruno's Office | I thought to myself: What did this person have in common with Nino's law school classmate?\n[1967-10-15 08:13:00] Bruno's Office | I thought there was no continuity between the time in Ischia and the sausage factory: Bruno jumped from one space to another, and between them lay an empty expanse.\n[1967-10-15 08:13:30] Bruno's Office | I knew it was probably because his father had recently fallen ill, and suddenly the entire burden of the company (some said it was debt) fell upon his shoulders. I thought she felt he was now ruined.\n[1967-10-15 08:14:00] Bruno's Office | I saw her tell Bruno about the problem she had encountered, and Bruno laughed.\n[1967-10-15 08:14:30] Bruno's Office | \"I heard 'Lina,' he said, 'I did you a favor, please don't get me into trouble. Everyone here is working hard, don't always come at them full of anger, all sharp edges. People need to have some fun sometimes, or else problems will start.\"\n[1967-10-15 08:15:00] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"Have your fun with each other, don't bother me.\"\n[1967-10-15 08:15:30] Bruno's Office | I saw him look at Lina with interest. I heard, \"I thought you liked to joke around before.\"\n[1967-10-15 08:16:00] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"That's when I wanted to make a joke.\"\n[1967-10-15 08:16:30] Bruno's Office | I saw that Lina's blunt words changed Bruno's tone. He became very serious, and his eyes didn't meet Lina's. I heard him say, \"You're still the same. On Ischia, you were so beautiful.\"\n[1967-10-15 08:17:00] Bruno's Office | I saw and then he pointed at the door. I heard, \"You go to work, go on.\"",

    "text": "[1967-10-20 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | From that moment on, every time Bruno met her at the factory, he would speak well of her in front of everyone. I knew it meant: under the favor of the young boss, you'd better not provoke her.\n[1967-11-10 13:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that one afternoon, this incident seemed to be confirmed, just after lunch, when a big fat woman named Theresa blocked her and spoke to her in a sneering way. I heard, \"Please go to the drying room.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:05:00] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw Lina come into the large room filled with dried sausages. I saw it was a square room, its ceiling hung with sausages under the yellow light.\n[1967-11-10 13:05:30] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw her seeing Bruno. I thought that on the surface, he was checking the sausages, but actually he wanted to chat.\n[1967-11-10 13:06:00] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw him pacing back and forth in the room, touching here and sniffing there, looking very knowledgeable.\n[1967-11-10 13:06:30] Meat Factory Drying Room | I saw him asking about the news of her sister-in-law, Pinocchia. I thought this would annoy Lina.\n[1967-11-10 13:07:00] Meat Factory Drying Room | I saw him not even glance at her, he kept checking the sausages. I heard him say, \"She was never satisfied with your brother. That summer, she fell in love with me, just like you fell in love with Nino.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:07:30] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw him take a step forward, his back to her, and continue speaking. I heard, \"She made me realize that women in a reproductive state really like sex.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:08:00] Meat Factory Drying Room | I saw him speak, and without giving her a chance to respond, mock, or get angry, he stopped in the center of the room and said. I had heard that everything in the factory disgusted him, but in the drying room, he always felt good, satisfied. The products became perfect here, exuding an enticing aroma and were ready to be sold.\n[1967-11-10 13:08:30] Meat Plant Drying Room | I heard him say, \"Look, feel. These sausages are firm and hard. Smell this scent, it's a bit like the smell of a man and a woman embracing, touching each other. Do you like it? You don't know, how many women I've brought here since childhood.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:09:00] Meat Factory Drying Room | I saw him suddenly wrap his arms around Lina's waist, his lips sliding down her neck while he caressed her buttocks.\n[1967-11-10 13:09:30] Meat Factory Drying Room | I saw the movements extremely quick and tense, as if a hundred hands were moving up and down on her apron. I thought it was a meaningless exploration, a pure invasion.\n[1967-11-10 13:10:00] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I smelled the taste of sausages. I thought that for Lina, everything here reminded her of Stefano's brutality.\n[1967-11-10 13:10:30] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I thought for a few seconds, and she felt dazed, afraid of being killed.\n[1967-11-10 13:11:00] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw it, but she quickly came to her senses. She attacked his face and the area between his legs, shouting angrily. I heard, \"You piece of dog shit! You don't have anything down there! Come here, pull it out and see if I dare rip it off, you bastard!\"\n[1967-11-10 13:11:30] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw Bruno let her go and take a few steps back. He touched his bleeding lip, gave an awkward smile, and muttered something. I heard, \"I'm sorry, I thought you might have a little bit of gratitude for me.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:12:00] Meat Factory Drying Room | I saw Lina shouting at him. \"I heard you say, 'You mean I should show some appreciation, or else you'll fire me, right?'\"\n[1967-11-10 13:12:30] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw him smile again, then shook his head and said. I heard, \"No, if you don't want to, then it's okay. I've already apologized to you. What else do I have to do?\"\n[1967-11-10 13:13:00] Meat Plant Drying Room | I thought about it, but at that moment she was furious. Only then did she feel the touch of his hands on her body. She knew that this disgusting feeling was hard to get rid of, not something that could be washed away with soap.\n[1967-11-10 13:13:30] Meat Processing Plant Drying Room | I saw her walk to the door and say something to him. I heard, \"This time you're lucky, but whether you fire me or not, you touched me, and I'll remember this.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:14:00] Meat Factory Drying Room | I heard Bruno mutter as I saw her leave. I heard, \"What did I do to you? I didn't do anything. Come here, if this is the problem, let's talk about it properly.\"\n[1967-11-10 13:15:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw her immediately return to her own workstation. I know that back then, she worked in the steam of the hot pool, a supporting job that required keeping the floor dry, but she often toiled without success.\n[1967-11-10 13:15:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw Edo, the worker whose ear had almost been torn off, looking at her with a curious expression.\n[1967-11-10 13:16:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | When I saw her come back from the storage room, all the male and female workers turned their eyes toward her.\n[1967-11-10 13:16:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I didn't look at anyone's face, not even Lina's. She grabbed a rag, threw it onto the tile floor, and started mopping. I saw water all over the floor.\n[1967-11-10 13:17:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw her speaking loudly, word by word, and her fellow workers were all bent over their work. I heard, \"Let's see, which other fucking bitch still wants to try.\"\n[1967-11-15 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought about how she had been waiting for days, expecting to be fired, but no one had told her yet.\n[1967-11-20 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that sometimes she met Bruno, who would offer a polite smile, and she would just give a cold nod.\n[1967-11-20 08:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought, so besides the nausea caused by those small short hands touching her, there was a wave of hatred, with no other consequences.\n[1967-11-20T10:00:00] Home | I found out all of this later. I immediately set off to Saint John with the address Pinocchia had given me to find Lina. I was thinking about it, but at that moment, something important happened to me.\n[1967-11-20T10:05:00] Home | I saw one morning, I was absentmindedly looking at a long letter Pietro had written me.\n[1967-11-20T10:10:00] Home | I saw at the bottom of the letter, he had written a few short sentences telling me that he had shown my \"text\" (he used that exact word) to his mother.\n[1967-11-20T10:15:00] Home | I thought Adele Airota did a great job with the novel; she had it typed on a typewriter and sent it to a Porto publisher. I know that for many years, she has been working as a literary translator at this publishing house.\n[1967-11-20T10:20:00] Home | I saw that the publisher really liked the novel, and they were planning to publish it.\n[1967-11-20T11:50:00] Home | I saw it was a late autumn morning, almost noon by then, and I remember the sky had a gray, hazy light.\n[1967-11-20T11:55:00] Home | I saw myself sitting in front of the kitchen table, and my mother was ironing clothes on that very table. I saw her old iron pressing firmly over the fabric, and the wooden table trembled under my elbow.\n[1967-11-20T12:00:00] Home | I saw myself looking at those lines for a long time.\n[1967-11-20T12:05:00] Home | I heard myself speaking in Italian, softly, just to convince myself that this was really happening. I heard, \"Mom, the letter says they're going to publish a novel I wrote.\"\n[1967-11-20T12:10:00] Home | I saw my mother stop, take the iron off the clothes, and stand it upright.\n[1967-11-20T12:15:00] Home | I heard her ask, \"You wrote a novel?\" in her dialect. \"I think so.\"\n[1967-11-20T12:20:00] Home | I heard, \"Did you write it after all?\" \"I did.\"\n[1967-11-20T12:25:00] Home | I heard, \"They gave you money?\" \"I don't know.\"",

    "text": "[1967-11-20T12:30:00] Capodimonte | I saw myself going out, I ran to Solara's bar. I knew that there I could make long-distance calls, which was more convenient.\n[1967-11-20T12:35:00] Capodimonte | I saw Geyao la shouting at me from the counter. I heard, \"Come on, hit me.\"\n[1967-11-20T12:40:00] Capodimonte | I saw that after trying several times, it was Pietro who answered the phone, but he had something to do and had to leave right away.\n[1967-11-20T12:45:00] Capodimonte | I saw him talk about the novel, he told me everything in the letter, he only knew that much.\n[1967-11-20T12:50:00] Capodimonte | I saw him and I was very excited, so I asked him. I heard, \"Did you read it?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1967-11-20T12:55:00] Capodimonte | I saw him mutter something, saying he had little time, that he needed to study, and that there were many things to do. I heard, \"But you didn't say anything.\"\n[1967-11-20T13:00:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"What do you think?\" \"It's good.\"\n[1967-11-20T13:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw him give me a phone number from his parents' house. \"I heard 'Is there nothing else?' 'It's very good. Talk to my mother! I'm into documents, not literature.'\"\n[1967-11-20T13:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw that he was a bit impatient; he was usually very polite, he said. I heard, \"I can't call him, I feel so embarrassed.\" \"You wrote a novel, now you have to take responsibility.\"\n[1967-11-20T13:15:00] Capodimonte | I know I don't know much about Adele Airota-Pietro; I've met her only four times, and we've only exchanged a few polite words. I thought she had always been a wealthy, cultured, and well-born mother.\n[1967-11-20T13:20:00] Capodimonte | I know the people from Pietro's family never talk about themselves; they act as if their activities in the world don't matter, yet they also seem to think it should be well known.\n[1967-11-20T13:25:00] Capodimonte | I realized then that she had a job, that she was an influential person.\n[1967-11-20T13:30:00] Capodimonte | I called her, feeling very uneasy, and it was the housekeeper from their family who answered. Later, Adele Airota picked up the phone.\n[1967-11-20T13:35:00] Capodimonte | I saw us greeting each other politely, she addressed me with \"you,\" and I also addressed her with \"you.\"\n[1967-11-20T13:40:00] Capodimonte | I saw her say that the people at the publishing house were all sure it was a good book, and as far as she knew, they had already started drafting a contract.\n[1967-11-20T13:45:00] Capodimonte | I heard \"contract?\" \"Of course, have you already been in talks with other publishers?\"\n[1967-11-20T13:50:00] Capodimonte | I saw her ask me in a joking tone. I heard, \"No. I haven't read it again yet.\" \"Did you write it all in one go?\"\n[1967-11-20T13:55:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"Yes.\" \"I assure you, this book is ready for publication like this.\"\n[1967-11-20T14:00:00] Capodimonte | \"I still need to make some changes.\" \"You have to believe me. Don't change a single comma. The text has an honesty and naturalness that only real books have.\"\n[1967-11-20T14:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw her praise me again. I thought, despite the mocking tone.\n[1967-11-20T14:10:00] Capodimonte | I asked her if there was anything else in the drawer, and I confessed to her that this was my first time writing. She was surprised. I know she said, as far as she knew, the Aeneid hadn't been revised either, and she thought I'd been practicing writing for a long time.\n[1967-11-20T14:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw her sigh and say to me that recently the publishing industry had suddenly faced a void, and my novel wasn't just being favored—it was perfectly timed. They wanted to release the book in spring. I heard, \"Talent plus luck!\"\n[1967-11-20T14:20:00] Capodimonte | I saw and immediately said no. \"I heard 'So early?' 'You don't want to?'”\n[1967-11-20T14:25:00] Capodimonte | I saw Geyola standing behind the counter at that moment. She had heard my conversation and finally asked me curiously. I heard \"What happened?\"\n[1967-11-20T14:30:00] Capodimonte | I saw her and said my reply, then left hurriedly. I heard \"I don't know either.\"\n[1967-11-20T14:40:00] Mergellina | I saw myself wandering around in Mergellina, feeling an incredible happiness, my temples pulsing.\n[1967-11-20T14:45:00] Mergellina | I thought about my answer to Geyola. It wasn't that I didn't want to pay attention to her or just brush her off. I really didn't know what had happened. What was the meaning of this unexpected notice?\n[1967-11-20T14:50:00] Mergellina | I thought of the few words Pietro had written to me, the long-distance call I made. Was all of this not real? What exactly was the contract? Would it talk about money, as well as rights and obligations? Would I get into trouble and danger?\n[1967-11-20T14:55:00] Mergellina | I thought to myself that maybe a few days later, they might change their minds and the book wouldn't be published.\n[1967-11-20T15:00:00] Mergellina | I thought about how they would reread my novel. Those who had previously thought it well-written might later find the story hollow. People who had never read it before might feel angry, surprised that someone even thought of publishing it.\n[1967-11-20T15:05:00] Mergellina | I thought that perhaps everyone would criticize Adele Airota, she herself might change her mind, feel humiliated, blame me for her embarrassment, and convince her son to leave me.\n[1967-11-20T15:10:00] Library | I saw myself exactly passing by the old library known as Mergellina, and I went inside. I thought to myself, how long has it been since I last went in?\n[1967-11-20T15:15:00] Library | I saw that it was empty, filled with the smell of dust and boredom.\n[1967-11-20T15:20:00] Library | I saw myself walking carelessly among the bookshelves, running my hands over the worn books. I didn't look at the titles or the authors, just let my fingers glide over them.\n[1967-11-20T15:25:00] Library | I saw the old books flickering past. I saw tangled threads of cotton, letters, ink, books, and chaotic words.\n[1967-11-20T15:30:00] Library | I was looking for \"Little Women,\" and then I found it.\n[1967-11-20T15:35:00] Library | What if everything I've ever imagined turning true? Could it be that I, really me, was destined to carry out the things Lina and I planned as children?\n[1967-11-20T15:40:00] Library | I thought that in a few months, a book would be published, printed entirely with my words, a traditional bound book, the spine glued together, and the cover bearing my name: Elena Greco.\n[1967-11-20T15:45:00] Library | I thought about how I had broken our family's long tradition of illiteracy and semi-literacy, how an unknown surname was now filled with glory.\n[1967-11-20T15:50:00] Library | I thought that in a few years, maybe three, five, ten, or twenty years, this book would also be placed on those shelves, appear in the library of Mergellina where I was born, be cataloged, and people would come here to borrow it, wanting to know what exactly the daughter of the building manager had written.\n[1967-11-20T15:55:00] Library | I heard the sound of water in the bathroom and I waited for Professor Ferraro to appear.\n[1967-11-20T16:00:00] Library | I know that when I was still a diligent little girl, he was the librarian here, with a thin, wrinkled face, his hair as white as snow, each strand standing straight up on his forehead, his hairline low.\n[1967-11-20T16:05:00] Library | I thought he would appreciate what had happened to me, that he would understand the storm in my mind, the pulsing in my temples.\n[1967-11-20T16:10:00] Library | I saw someone come out of the bathroom—a fat man in his forties.\n[1967-11-20T16:15:00] Library | I saw him asking me. I heard, \"Are you here to borrow a book? Hurry up, I'm about to close.\"\n[1967-11-20T16:20:00] Library | I heard, \"I'm looking for Professor Ferraro.\" \"Ferraro has retired. Hurry, he's about to close up.\"\n[1967-11-20T16:25:00] Library | I saw myself walking. I thought to myself that I was now becoming a writer, but in the entire Mergellina, no one could say those words to me: You did it! That's amazing, really great!\n[1967-12-01 08:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that the foremen still looked at Lina with the same arrogance, ignoring everyone else's expressions. Suddenly, their attitude changed completely, and they began to torment her.\n[1967-12-01 08:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw them constantly changing her job, working her to exhaustion, and often speaking to her harshly. I thought that meant they had obtained the boss's tacit approval.",

I heard, \"Why don't you tell me about the situation at the place where you work?\"\n[1967-12-01 20:30:00] At Lina's house | I saw Lina tease him, and then they would do the exercises together for their correspondence courses.\n[1967-12-01 21:00:00] At Lina's house | I thought they were all avoiding the issue, and there were several reasons for this, the main one being to avoid thinking about the future, about these questions: what was their real relationship?\n[1967-12-01 21:00:30] At Lina's home | I thought about why he took care of her, and also Gennaro? Why did she allow him to do that? Why had they lived under the same roof for so long, yet Enzo still waited every night in vain for her to come to him?\n[1967-12-01 23:00:00] Lina's house | I saw him tossing and turning in bed. I made an excuse to go to the kitchen for a glass of water, just to take a look at her door's glass, to see if her light was off, to catch a glimpse of her figure.\n[1967-12-01 23:00:30] At Lina's house | I thought about how they remained silent, all of them testing each other—if he knocked on the door, I would let him in—his hesitation, her uncertainty.\n[1967-12-01 23:30:00] Lina's house | I thought, in the end, they all preferred to use their minds on those patterns and workbooks, as if it were a kind of physical exercise.\n[1967-12-01T10:00:00] Home | When I received the draft contract, I found out that the publisher was going to pay me twenty million lire in advance, ten million upon signing, and another ten million when I delivered the manuscript. Of course, this wouldn't have been possible without Adele Airota's support. I thought I would never make money.\n[1967-12-01T10:05:00] At home | I saw my mother stunned when she found out. I thought she could never believe it was real.\n[1967-12-01T10:10:00] Home | I saw the two of them start showing off in Mergellina. I heard my father say, \"It will take me several months to earn that much money.\"\n[1967-12-01T10:15:00] Home | I heard, \"Our daughter is now a writer, she's rich, and she'll soon marry a university professor.\"\n[1967-12-01T10:20:00] Home | I saw my whole self glowing with vitality, no longer preparing for the position of a kindergarten teacher.\n[1967-12-05 21:00:00] At Lina's house | I heard \"Let's make a door-opening pattern,\" Lina said. \"Let's make a necktie pattern,\" Enzo said.\n[1967-12-05 21:00:30] At Lina's house | I heard \"Let's do a pattern where I tie Gennaro's shoes.\" Lina said. \"Let's do a pattern where we make coffee with the coffee pot.\" Enzo said.\n[1967-12-05 21:01:00] At Lina's house | I know that from simple to complex tasks, even though the Zurich tests don't cover these issues, they have been struggling to figure out the patterns of daily life.\n[1967-12-05 21:01:30] At Lina's house | I thought it wasn't because Enzo wanted to do these things, but rather, as usual, Lina started making bold attempts, becoming more active every night than before.\n[1967-12-05 21:02:00] At Lina's house | I saw that even though it was cold at home at night, she was full of passion. I thought these exercises reduced the tragic world around her to just zeros and ones.\n[1967-12-05 21:02:30] Lina's house | I thought she was seeking an abstract simplicity—the most abstract of all abstractions—and she hoped to find a reassuring, definitive answer.\n[1967-12-05T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself buying a dress and some cosmetics as soon as I got the money, and for the first time in my life, I went to a hairdresser.\n[1967-12-10 21:00:00] At Lina's house | I heard her say one evening, \"We need to standardize the factory process.\" \"Every step of the factory's process?\" he asked uneasily. \"Yes.\"\n[1967-12-10 21:00:30] Lina's house | I saw him looking at Lina and saying. I heard, \"We'll start with your factory.\"\n[1967-12-10 21:01:00] At Lina's house | I saw her make an annoyed face, muttering goodnight, then went back to her room.\n[1967-12-10T09:00:00] Porto | I saw myself heading to Porto. I thought of a city that was completely unfamiliar to me.\n[1967-12-10T10:00:00] Mask Location 005 | I couldn't figure out the direction at the train station and finally took the subway, feeling uneasy, until I arrived at the publishing house's entrance.\n[1967-12-10T10:15:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw myself explaining to the doorman for a long time, even though he didn't ask me anything; he kept reading the newspaper while I was talking.\n[1967-12-10T10:20:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw myself taking the elevator up, knocking on the door, and then entering the publishing house's office. I was dazzled by the cleanliness and order before me.\n[1967-12-10T10:25:00] Via Caracciolo | I felt overwhelmed, all the things I had learned surged within me.\n[1967-12-10T10:30:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought about what I wanted to show: even though I was a girl, even though I came from a poor background, I still retained my old habits, but by the time I was twenty-three, I had managed to secure the right to publish a book, and everything about me was beyond reproach.\n[1967-12-10T10:35:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw that I was being warmly received, passing one office after another.\n[1967-12-10T11:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw myself talking briefly with the editor who was handling my manuscript. I saw that it was an old man, bald on top, but his face was very finely shaped.\n[1967-12-10T13:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw that we had discussed for about two hours, and he praised me highly, often mentioning Adele Airota-Pietro with respect.\n[1967-12-10T13:05:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw him showing me the areas that needed improvement, and he gave me a manuscript with his annotations on it.\n[1967-12-10T13:10:00] Via Caracciolo | When I was leaving, he spoke to me in a serious tone. I heard, \"This story is excellent, written with great detail and moving language, but that's not the point.\"\n[1967-12-10T13:15:00] Via Caracciolo | \"I heard, 'This is the third time I've read your book, and every page echoes with a powerful thing I don't understand where it comes from.'\"\n[1967-12-10T13:20:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw my face turn red as I thanked him. I thought of it! How much have I accomplished! Everything happened so fast, and everyone loves me so much!\n[1967-12-10T13:25:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought about how good I was at talking about my studies, where I had studied, and my thesis on the fourth book of the Aeneid.\n[1967-12-10T13:30:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw myself responding to a polite question with a very proper tone. I thought of Teacher Galiani, her children, and Mariarosa's way of speaking and her art of conversation.\n[1967-12-10T13:35:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw a young and beautiful female employee named Gina, who asked if I needed a hotel room. I said I did, and she booked one for me on Garibaldi Street.\n[1967-12-10T13:40:00] Via Caracciolo | I knew all the expenses would be reimbursed by the publisher—money I spent on meals, as well as the train tickets back and forth. I thought what surprised me was.\n[1967-12-10T13:45:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw Gina write down my expenses, telling me I would get the money later, and she told me to say hello to Adele Airota. \"I heard her say, 'She called me, she's very concerned about the book.'\"\n[1967-12-11T09:00:00] On the train | I saw that the next day I set out for Borgo, and I wanted to embrace Pietro. On the train, I looked one by one at the editor's notes in the manuscript, feeling satisfied. I saw my book being read by someone who appreciated it, and it had been revised to even greater perfection.",

I thought about being happy for myself.\n[1967-12-11T14:00:00] Borgo | I saw my boyfriend had me staying in the home of a Greek literature assistant. I knew that it was someone I also knew.\n[1967-12-11T20:00:00] Restaurant Borgo | That night, Pietro took me to dinner, and he showed me a copy of my manuscript. It turned out he had his own copy, and he'd even made notes in the margins. I thought what surprised me was.\n[1967-12-11T20:05:00] Restaurant Borgo | I saw us looking through the annotations together, one by one. I thought the footnotes reflected his usual strictness, especially his attention to words.\n[1967-12-11T20:10:00] Restaurant Borgo | I saw myself thanking him. I heard, \"I'll think it over.\"\n[1967-12-11T21:00:00] Field | After dinner, we came to a quiet lawn.\n[1967-12-11T21:05:00] Field | After the disappointing, cold affection we had gone through, he asked me to carefully revise the pages where the heroine lost her virginity on the beach. I saw that we were both wearing thick sweaters.\n[1967-12-11T21:10:00] Lawn | I saw that I said uneasily. I heard, \"That was an important moment.\"\n[1967-12-11T21:15:00] Field | \"I heard, 'You yourself said, these pages are a bit too much.' 'The publisher didn't raise any objections either.'\"\n[1967-12-11T21:20:00] Lawn | I saw that I told him I would think about his suggestion. I heard, \"They'll bring it up later.\" I thought I felt very anxious.\n[1967-12-12T09:00:00] On the train | I felt terrible when I left for San Gregorio Armeno the next day. I thought about how, as someone who had read a lot of books and even written a treatise on the worship of Dionysus, Pietro was still uncomfortable with those pages. What would my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and the entire Mergellina say when they read them?\n[1967-12-12T10:00:00] On the train | I saw on the train, I kept looking at those words, thinking about the editor's words and Pietro's words, and I deleted everything I could. I thought that I hoped this book would be a good one, a book that would harm no one.\n[1967-12-12T10:05:00] On the train | I thought to myself that I would never write another book.\n[1967-12-15T10:00:00] Home | I saw that as soon as I got back home, I received some bad news.\n[1967-12-15T10:05:00] Home | I saw my mother receive a package that had come from Potenza. I thought she felt she had the right to check my emails when I wasn't around.\n[1967-12-15T10:10:00] Home | I saw that the package contained a few notebooks I'd used in elementary school, along with a note written by Professor Oliviero's sister.\n[1967-12-15T10:15:00] Home | I know the note said that my teacher passed away quietly more than twenty days ago.\n[1967-12-15T10:20:00] Home | I know she said that in the last period of his life, Teacher Oliviero often mentioned me and instructed her to return the notebooks I'd used as a child, which she had kept as mementos.\n[1967-12-15T10:25:00] Home | I was moved, and my sister Elena was too; she cried for several hours straight.\n[1967-12-15T10:30:00] Home | I saw that this upset my mother, so she shouted angrily at the younger daughter and then made her older daughter—the one who was me—hear it.\n[1967-12-15T10:35:00] Home | I saw her loudly commenting. I heard, \"That fool always thinks he's more like a mother than I am.\"\n[1967-12-15T12:00:00] Home | I thought about Oliviero teacher all day. I imagined how proud she would be if she knew I had graduated with top marks and was about to publish my own book.\n[1967-12-15T22:00:00] Home | I saw everyone [intimate act] asleep, so I locked myself in the silent kitchen, flipping through the notes page by page. I thought how well she taught! My teacher.\n[1967-12-15T22:05:00] Home | I thought about the calligraphy she taught me, which was truly beautiful. Unfortunately, after growing up, my handwriting became smaller, and I simplified the letters to write faster.\n[1967-12-15T22:10:00] At home | I saw myself watching the teacher mark the places with spelling errors using an angry pen, as well as the comments \"excellent\" and \"good.\"\n[1967-12-15T22:15:00] Home | Sometimes when I wrote a good sentence or solved a difficult problem, the notes she made in the margins of my homework and the high grades she gave me would make me smile knowingly.\n[1967-12-15T22:20:00] At home | I have wondered for a long time whether she is actually more like a mother to me than my own mother.\n[1967-12-15T22:25:00] Home | I knew she had planned a path for me, and she forced me to follow it—a path my mother could never have imagined. I think about this, and I feel very grateful toward her.\n[1967-12-15T22:30:00] Home | I was about to put the package away and go to bed when I noticed that among these notebooks there were a dozen pages, folded in half and held together by a paper clip.\n[1967-12-15T22:35:00] Home | I saw it and my heart gave a jolt; I recognized it, it was The Blue Fairy written by Lina many years ago. I thought back to how many years ago? Thirteen or fourteen years, maybe.\n[1967-12-15T22:40:00] At home | I thought about how much I loved the crayon colors on the cover and the beautiful font of the title. At that time, I felt this was a real book, and I was jealous.\n[1967-12-15T22:45:00] Home | I saw myself opening those pages from the middle. I saw that the paperclip had already rusted, leaving a yellow stain on the paper.\n[1967-12-15T22:50:00] Home | I saw, to my surprise, that the teacher had written beside it: \"Brilliant!\" I thought, so she read this story? So she really liked this story?\n[1967-12-15T22:55:00] Home | I saw myself flipping through the pages, each one filled with words like \"good,\" \"excellent,\" and \"wonderful.\" I thought about how angry I was.\n[1967-12-15T23:00:00] Home | I thought to myself, the old witch, why didn't you tell us that you liked this story so much? Why didn't you give Lina some praise?\n[1967-12-15T23:05:00] At home | I thought about what made you fight for my education instead of hers. The cobbler didn't let his daughter take the entrance exam—can you explain your attitude? How much resentment was there in your mind, that you vented it all on her?\n[1967-12-15T23:10:00] At home | I saw myself watching the The Blue Fairy from start to finish. I saw that the ink had turned white, and her handwriting was very similar to mine.\n[1967-12-15T23:15:00] At home | I felt a stomach ache as soon as I saw the first page, and soon I was drenched in cold sweat. I thought about it, but in the end, I had to admit that I understood the few lines I read — the passages Lina wrote back then were the secret core of my book.\n[1967-12-15T23:20:00] Home | I thought that to find out what gave my book its heat, there must be a strong but invisible clue running through everything, and that I should analyze the girl's story: a dozen pages in a notebook, a rusted paperclip, a colorful cover that was bright, a story with a title but no author's name.\n[1967-12-16T06:00:00] Home | I didn't sleep all night, waiting for dawn. I realized that my long-standing hostility toward Lina had vanished, and suddenly I felt that what I had taken from her was far less than what she had taken from me.\n[1967-12-16T07:00:00] Home | I decided to go straight to Stazione Centrale, I planned to find her.\n[1967-12-16T07:05:00] Home | I thought about returning The Blue Fairy to her, showing her my notebook, and going through the things the teacher had kept together with her, reading the teacher's comments together.\n[1967-12-16T07:10:00] Home | I thought, but I felt that what I needed most was to sit beside her and say: \"Look, how closely we were connected back then, the two of us were one, each of us represented the other.\"",

I would show her how a book she had read as a child had taken such deep root in my mind that over the years it had become a book in its own right.\n[1967-12-16T07:20:00] At home | I thought that although the story was different, mine was a mature work, but its root lay in her book, the source being the imagination we developed while playing together in the courtyard.\n[1967-12-16T07:25:00] Home | I thought about how we kept making shapes together, then changing them, and starting all over again.\n[1967-12-16T07:30:00] Home | I thought about how much I wanted to embrace her, to kiss her, to tell her: Lina, from now on, no matter what happens, we must never lose each other.\n[1967-12-16T08:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought of it, but that was a very unbearable morning; I felt the whole city was against me, and against her.\n[1967-12-16T08:15:00] On the bus | I saw myself first boarding a very crowded bus heading toward the Marina coast. I saw and felt that all around me were the bodies of poor people, constantly squeezing me in an unbearable way.\n[1967-12-16T09:00:00] On the bus | I saw later, I got on another bus, even more crowded, and I was going the wrong way.\n[1967-12-16T09:15:00] Station | I saw myself getting down from that car, my hair a mess, and after waiting a long time, I angrily got on another bus to make up for my mistake.\n[1967-12-16T09:30:00] On the bus | I thought about how the journey through San Gregorio Armeno had already driven me to the edge, and what was the point of attending middle school, then high school, and finally the Normal University in this city?\n[1967-12-16T09:45:00] On the bus | I thought about how, in order to reach Saint John, I would naturally have to lower myself, just like Lina wasn't moving into a street or a square, but into a crack in the past, the time before we started school, a dark period without rules or respect.\n[1967-12-16T10:00:00] On the bus | I saw myself using the worst words I had in Mergellina to curse others, being cursed in return, threatening others, being threatened back, and then retorting with sharp words. I thought that this was the evil art of language I had been trained to master.\n[1967-12-16T10:15:00] On the bus | I thought about what San Gregorio Armeno had taught me, which could be useful in Borgo, but the things I learned in Borgo were of no use in San Gregorio Armeno, and those things had become an obstacle for me.\n[1967-12-16T10:30:00] On the bus | I thought about those polite expressions, the refined voices and appearances, the language I had learned from books, and the etiquette I showed in crowded places—all of them tied me down, things I couldn't escape.\n[1967-12-16T10:45:00] On the bus | I thought about the bus ride to Saint John, where I temporarily set aside the pride and elegance that came with my new identity—I had graduated with top marks, dined with Professor Pietro, whose son was my boyfriend, had some money in the post office, and had been received by important people at Porto. How could these scumbags treat me like this?\n[1967-12-16T11:00:00] On the bus | I thought about how I had regained my old skills, and I felt full of strength, completely unable to pretend to be indifferent. This was usually my way of surviving both inside and outside of Mergellina.\n[1967-12-16T11:15:00] On the bus | I was in the crowded crowd, and several times I felt a man's hand touching me. I immediately shouted angrily, spewing out the kind of filthy language that my mother, especially Lina, was most skilled at.\n[1967-12-16T11:20:00] On the bus | I saw how exaggerated my words were, and when I got out of the car, I was certain someone would jump out and kill me.\n[1967-12-16T11:30:00] Porto | I saw nothing happening, but I still walked away with anger and fear. I thought I had left home neat and clean, but now I feel as if I've been ruined and messed up inside and out.\n[1967-12-16T11:35:00] Porto | I saw myself trying to calm down, and I said to myself, \"Relax, you're almost there.\"\n[1967-12-16T11:40:00] Porto | I saw myself asking a passerby for directions.\n[1967-12-16T11:45:00] Porto | I saw myself walking along Stazione Centrale. I felt the cold wind whipping my face, and I had the sensation of sailing on a filthy river, with broken walls and ruins on either side, along with trash and dark, gaping doors.\n[1967-12-16T11:50:00] Porto | I saw myself wandering around the street, completely confused. The information people provided was detailed, and they were very polite, but it was of no use to me at all.\n[1967-12-16T12:00:00] Building 012 | I saw it in the end, and finally found that path, and that gate.\n[1967-12-16T12:05:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I saw myself climbing up the dirty steps. I saw and smelled that the hallway was filled with a strong garlic odor, and children's voices were coming from somewhere.\n[1967-12-16T12:10:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I saw a very fat woman in a green sweater stick her head out of the door, and when she saw me, she called out. I heard, \"Who are you looking for?\"\n[1967-12-16T12:15:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I said, \"Karakas,\" but when I saw her look confused, I immediately corrected myself and said, \"Skanio.\" I knew that was Enzo's surname.\n[1967-12-16T12:20:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I still felt confused seeing her, and I continued, \"Lina.\" I heard the woman repeat \"Lina\" again, then she raised a thick arm and said, \"On the upper floor.\"\n[1967-12-16T12:25:00] Building 012 | I saw myself thanking her, then I went up. At that moment, she leaned over the railing of the stairs and shouted something from above. I heard, \"Dedina, someone is looking for Lina; she's coming up.\"\n[1967-12-16T12:30:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I thought of Lina's name being spoken by these strangers, in this place, only at this moment did I remember the last time I saw Lina.\n[1967-12-16T12:35:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I thought of that time in the new Mergellina house, where she was still in that state: furniture, refrigerator, television, the very refined child—these had all become her normal surroundings and background, along with her own appearance, which no matter what, always made her look like a young, well-to-do wife.\n[1967-12-16T12:40:00] Building 012 | I thought about this, and I realized I knew nothing about how she was living or what she was doing.\n[1967-12-16T12:45:00] Building 012 | I know the rumors about her—just that she left her husband, left that beautiful house and the life of wealth, which is hard to believe, and she went off with Enzo Scanno. I thought about the fact that I didn't know about her meeting with Soccavo.\n[1967-12-16T12:50:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I thought that when I left Mergellina, I was certain I would see her in a new house, reading a book, playing a puzzle game with the children, or shopping outside.\n[1967-12-16T12:55:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I thought of it as a matter of laziness, or perhaps to avoid discomfort, and mechanically placed these images in the place called Stazione Centrale.\n[1967-12-16T13:00:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I saw myself going upstairs, still carrying that sense of anticipation. I thought to myself: I have finally arrived, I have reached my destination.\n[1967-12-16T13:05:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I saw myself appear before Didiña. I saw her: a very young woman holding a girl in her arms. The child was quietly sobbing, weeping silently. Her snot was dripping from her upper lip, her nostrils were red from the cold, and two other children were tugging at her skirt, one on each side.\n[1967-12-16T13:10:00] Building 012 | I saw Diddina looking at the door across from her. I saw the door was closed.\n[1967-12-16T13:15:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I saw her speak rudely. I heard, \"Lina isn't here.\"\n[1967-12-16T13:20:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I heard, \"Is Enzo not here either?\" \"No.\"\n[1967-12-16T13:25:00] Building Stazione Centrale | I heard, \"Did she take the child out?\" \"Who is this?\"\n[1967-12-16T13:30:00] Building 012 | I heard, \"My name is Elena Greco, a friend of hers.\"\n[1967-12-16T13:35:00] Building 012 | I saw her pat the head of one of the children beside her. I heard, \"You didn't recognize Rino? Rino, have you never met this lady before?\"",

I heard, \"Hello, Aunt Elena. Mom won't be back until eight o'clock tonight.\"\n[1967-12-16T13:50:00] Building 012 | I saw myself pulling him over and hugging him. I praised him for being good-looking and for speaking well.\n[1967-12-16T13:55:00] Building 012 | I heard \"He's great.\" Dida also admitted, \"He's naturally suited to be a professor.\"\n[1967-12-16T14:00:00] Elena's house | At that moment, I saw that she no longer had any hostility toward me; she wanted me to come inside her house.\n[1967-12-16T14:05:00] Elena's house | I saw something in the dark hallway, and I must have bumped into a child's thing. I saw that the kitchen was in a mess, and every object emitted a yellow light.\n[1967-12-16T14:10:00] Elena's house | I saw that there was still a piece of fabric under the needle at the sewing machine, and the floor was covered with pieces of fabric in all colors.\n[1967-12-16T14:15:00] Elena's house | I felt a bit embarrassed when I saw Diddina, and quickly started to tidy up. Later, she stopped and went to make me a cup of coffee. I thought about how she had held her daughter all along the way.\n[1967-12-16T14:20:00] Elena's house | I saw myself placing little Rino on my knee and asking him some very innocent questions, which he answered cleverly.\n[1967-12-16T14:25:00] Elena's house | At that moment, the woman told me about Lina and Enzo.\n[1967-12-16T14:30:00] Elena's house | I saw the woman say. I heard, \"She's making sausages in Soccavo now.\"\n[1967-12-16T14:35:00] Elena's house | I thought to myself, I felt amazed, only at this moment did I remember Bruno.\n[1967-12-16T14:40:00] Elena's house | \"I heard 'Socavo, the one who makes sausage casings?' \" \"Yes.\"\n[1967-12-16T14:45:00] Elena's house | I heard, \"I know him.\" \"Not a good person at all.\"\n[1967-12-16T14:50:00] Elena's house | I heard, \"I know their son.\" \"Grandfather, father, and son— all rotten people. When they got money, they forgot the time when their pants had patches.\"\n[1967-12-16T14:55:00] Dinna's house | I asked about Enzo, and she said he works at the electric locomotive factory. I knew she had mentioned \"Mr. Lina\" with respect and affection. I thought about the way she spoke, and I quickly realized that she believed Enzo and Lina were married.\n[1967-12-16T15:00:00] Elena's house | I heard, \"When is Lina coming back?\" \"Tonight.\"\n[1967-12-16T15:05:00] Dinna's house | I heard, \"Where's the child?\" \"I'm watching him, he's eating here, playing here.\"\n[1967-12-16T15:10:00] Elena's house | I thought that therefore my journey was not yet over: I was approaching Lina, while she was moving away from me.\n[1967-12-16T15:15:00] Elena's house | I heard myself ask, \"How long does it take to get to the factory from here?\" \"Twenty minutes.\"\n[1967-12-16T15:20:00] Elena's house | I saw Diddina drawing a route on a piece of paper when little Rino politely asked me. I heard, \"Auntie, can I go play now?\"\n[1967-12-16T15:25:00] Elena's house | I saw him waiting for me to say \"okay,\" so I ran into the hallway and started playing with another child. I saw that I was about to hear him shout some ugly curses in his dialect.\n[1967-12-16T15:30:00] Elena's house | I saw the woman give me an awkward look and shout at me from the kitchen in Italian. I heard, \"Rino, don't speak that way! Just wait until I come over and spank your hand.\"\n[1967-12-16T15:35:00] Elena's house | I saw myself smiling at her, and I remembered the scene when I took the bus here. I thought, she's going to hit my hand too, and my situation with little Rino is the same.\n[1967-12-16T15:40:00] Elena's house | I saw that the shouting in the hallway hadn't stopped yet, so we had to run over to check. I saw two kids throwing things at each other, screaming and cursing loudly.\n[1967-12-16T15:45:00] Corner of the factory | I saw that my attention was drawn to her swollen hands and the wounds on them. I saw both old and new wounds, one of which was a new injury on my left thumb, with some infection around the wound. I didn't pay much attention to her movements or her feelings at the time. I imagined that beneath the bandage on her right hand, there was a more serious wound.\n[1967-12-16T15:50:00] Corner of the factory | I saw her immediately pull her hand back and put it into her pocket. I heard, \"What did you do?\" \"Nothing. Removing meat from the bone can cut your fingers.\"\n[1967-12-16T15:55:00] Corner of the factory | I heard, \"You want me to cut the meat?\" \"Whatever they want me to do, I have to do it.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:00:00] Corner of the factory | I heard, \"You talk to Bruno.\" \"Bruno is the most beastly of them all. He's here just to see who he can take advantage of in the warehouse?\"\n[1967-12-16T16:05:00] Corner of the factory | I heard \"Lina!\" \"That's the truth.\" \"Are you okay?\"\n[1967-12-16T16:10:00] Corner of the factory | \"I heard, 'I'm fine. Here in the freezer, they give me an extra ten lire as a freezing allowance.'\"\n[1967-12-16T16:15:00] Corner of the factory | I saw the man shouting. I heard, \"Ciro! Two minutes have already passed.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:20:00] Corner of the factory | I saw and whispered. \"I'm coming right away,\" she said. \"Teacher Oliviero is dead.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:25:00] Corner of the factory | I saw her shrug her shoulders and then say. I heard, \"She's very sick, it was bound to happen sooner or later.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:30:00] Corner of the factory | I saw the man pushing the cart starting to get impatient, so I immediately said. I heard, \"She had The Blue Fairy sent to me.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:35:00] Corner of the factory | I looked at her, trying to figure out if she really didn't remember, and I felt she was sincere. I heard, \"What is The Blue Fairy?\"\n[1967-12-16T16:40:00] Corner of the factory | I heard, \"It's a book you wrote when you were ten.\" \"A book?\" \"That's what we called it back then.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:45:00] Corner of the factory | I saw Lina press her lips together, she shook her head. She was very nervous, worried that something would go wrong with the job. I thought my arrival was really inopportune, I decided I should leave.\n[1967-12-16T16:50:00] Corner of the factory | I saw her tremble. I heard, \"A long time has already passed.\"\n[1967-12-16T16:55:00] Corner of the factory | I heard, \"Are you feverish?\" \"No.\"\n[1967-12-16T17:00:00] Corner of the factory | I saw myself taking those pages out of my bag and handing them to her, and she took them. I thought she recognized it as her own writing, but she didn't show any excitement.\n[1967-12-16T17:05:00] Corner of the factory | I saw her mutter something. I heard, \"I was once a proud child.\"\n[1967-12-16T17:10:00] Corner of the factory | I immediately denied what she said, and I told her. \"I heard, 'This story still looks great. I reread it and I found that I've always remembered it, even though I wasn't aware of it. My book came from here.'\"\n[1967-12-16T17:15:00] Corner of the factory | I saw her laughing loudly, but also uneasily. I heard, \"From such foolish talk? The person who chose to print this book must be crazy.\"\n[1967-12-16T17:20:00] Corner of the factory | I saw the man shouting. I heard, \"I've been waiting for you, Ciro!\"\n[1967-12-16T17:25:00] Corner of the factory | I saw her answer. I heard, \"You really piss me off!\"\n[1967-12-16T17:30:00] At the factory gate | I saw her put the pages of paper into her pocket, then she took my arm and we walked toward the door.\n[1967-12-16T17:35:00] At the factory gate | I thought, for her, how carefully I had dressed, how much effort it had taken to get here. I had imagined we would cry, talk intimately, argue, and spend a very beautiful morning together, confessing and making up with each other.\n[1967-12-16T17:40:00] At the factory gate | I saw it, and that was the result: we walked arm in arm, she dressed clumsily, dirty, and utterly exhausted, while I looked like a girl from a wealthy family.\n[1967-12-16T17:45:00] At the factory gate | I told her that little Rino was very handsome and smart. I spoke well of her neighbor, and I asked her about Enzo.\n[1967-12-16T17:50:00] At the factory gate | I was glad she was happy that I praised her child, and she also spoke well of the female neighbor. But when she mentioned Enzo, she became radiant and talkative.\n[1967-12-16T17:55:00] At the factory gate | I saw her say it. I heard, \"He's very nice, has a good temper, is fearless, very smart, and studies hard in the evening. He knows a lot.\"\n[1967-12-16T18:00:00] At the factory gate | I had never heard her speak like that about anyone, I asked. I heard, \"What is he learning?\"\n[1967-12-16T18:05:00] At the factory gate | I heard \"math.\" \"Enzo?\"\n[1967-12-16T18:10:00] At the factory gate | \"I heard, 'Yes. He read an article about IBM System, or maybe he saw an advertisement—I don't remember—which made him obsessed with IBM System.'\"\n[1967-12-16T18:15:00] At the factory gate | \"I heard him say that IBM System wasn't like the ones we see in movies, it had a lot of colored lights and made a beeping sound when turned on. He said IBM System was a language.\" \"A language?\"\n[1967-12-16T18:20:00] At the factory gate | I saw the look in her eyes, which seemed very sharp, as if she understood this language very well.\n[1967-12-16T18:25:00] At the factory gate | I saw her say. I heard, \"It's not the language we write novels in.\"\n[1967-12-16T18:30:00] At the factory gate | I heard her laugh after she said those words. The thing that troubled me was the way she dismissed the language of novels, and even more troubling was that.\n[1967-12-16T18:35:00] At the factory gate | I heard her say, \"They're all programming languages. After the kids go to sleep, Enzo will start studying them.\"\n[1967-12-16T18:40:00] At the factory gate | I saw her lips were dry, cracked from the cold, and her face was full of exhaustion and weariness.\n[1967-12-16T18:45:00] At the factory gate | I saw that, despite everything, she still said it with pride. I heard, \"He has started studying.\"\n[1967-12-16T18:50:00] At the factory gate | I thought to myself that I understood, even though she used the third person singular, I knew it wasn't just Enzo who had taken an interest in that thing.\n[1967-12-16T18:55:00] At the factory gate | I heard, \"He studies, but what do you do?\" \"I keep him company while he studies. He gets tired easily; if he studies alone, he falls asleep right away.\"\n[1967-12-16T19:00:00] At the factory gate | I heard, \"We'll have a lot of fun studying together. One of us asks a question, the other answers. Do you know what a chart is?\"\n[1967-12-16T19:05:00] At the factory gate | I saw myself shaking my head, and her eyes narrowed into a slit. She let go of my arm and tried to pull me into the world she was now obsessed with.",

    "text": "[1967-12-16T19:10:00] Factory courtyard | I smelled the fire in the courtyard, mixed with the odors of animal fat, meat, and tendons, and also the smell of Lina's thick coat and blue overall. Her hands were cracked, her hair was messy, and there wasn't a trace of makeup on her pale face.\n[1967-12-16T19:15:00] Factory courtyard | I saw her regain her vitality, full of energy.\n[1967-12-16T19:20:00] Factory Yard | I saw her reduce everything to an alternating sequence of true and false. She mentioned Boolean algebra and other things, all of which were completely unknown to me. I thought that, despite everything, her language still fascinated me.\n[1967-12-16T19:25:00] Factory courtyard | I thought of the time when she spoke, and I seemed to see her, on a night in that dilapidated house, with the child sleeping in another room.\n[1967-12-16T19:30:00] Factory Yard | I saw Enzo sitting on the bed, his face full of exhaustion after a long day at the electric locomotive factory.\n[1967-12-16T19:35:00] Factory courtyard | I saw her, either picking meat all day around the pot, or after working all day in the freezing cold of minus twenty degrees, sitting on the quilt with him.\n[1967-12-16T19:40:00] Factory courtyard | I saw the two of them in a blinding light, both of them sacrificing their sleep. I heard their voices, as they did chart exercises, trained themselves, eliminated everything unnecessary in the world, simplified their daily actions, and represented everything through just two real values—0 and 1.\n[1967-12-16T19:45:00] Factory courtyard | I thought of that humble room, where they spoke in profound words, whispering softly so as not to wake little Rino.\n[1967-12-16T19:50:00] Factory courtyard | I thought about how I had arrived there full of pride, confident and full of emotion, mainly wanting to show her what she had lost and what I had gained.\n[1967-12-16T19:55:00] Factory courtyard | I thought that when I appeared, she had already realized it. Now, she was risking a conflict with her coworkers and possible punishment. Her approach was to explain to me that I hadn't won anything, that there was nothing to win in this world.\n[1967-12-16T20:00:00] Factory courtyard | I thought about how her life was filled with all sorts of things, good or bad, heart-stopping events that were no less intense than everything I had experienced. Time just passed meaninglessly, and the occasional meeting was beautiful, just to hear another person's crazy thoughts and the echo of those thoughts in someone else's mind.\n[1967-12-16T20:05:00] Factory Yard | I asked, \"Do you like living with him?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1967-12-16T20:10:00] Factory courtyard | I saw her make a face, pretending to be happy. I heard, \"Will you [be pregnant]?\"\n[1967-12-16T20:15:00] Factory Yard | \"I heard, 'We're not together.' 'Not together?\"\n[1967-12-16T20:20:00] Factory Yard | \"I don't have any ideas,\" I said. \"What about him?\"\n[1967-12-16T20:25:00] Factory courtyard | \"I heard, 'He's waiting for me.' 'Maybe you think he's like an older brother.'\"\n[1967-12-16T20:30:00] Factory Yard | I heard, \"No, I like him.\" \"Then what's going on?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1967-12-16T20:35:00] Factory courtyard | I saw us stop in front of the bonfire, and she pointed at the guard. I heard, \"You should be careful with that person.\"\n[1967-12-16T20:40:00] Factory courtyard | I heard, \"When you go out, he'll say you stole the sausage, make an excuse to search you, just to feel you up.\"\n[1967-12-16T20:45:00] Factory courtyard | I saw us embrace for a moment, then she kissed my cheek.\n[1967-12-16T20:50:00] Factory courtyard | I told her I would look for her again, I didn't want to lose her, and I said it sincerely. I heard her smile slightly and whisper, \"Yes, I don't want to lose you either.\"\n[1967-12-16T20:55:00] Factory courtyard | I saw that her voice was also sincere.\n[1967-12-16T21:00:00] At the factory gate | I saw her and left very excitedly, but inside I felt it was hard to leave her.\n[1967-12-16T21:05:00] At the factory gate | I thought again that, just like before, I felt that without her, nothing truly important could happen in my life. Yet I still felt I had to escape from here as soon as possible, just to avoid smelling that greasy scent of hers again.\n[1967-12-16T21:10:00] At the factory gate | After taking a few quick steps, I still couldn't help but turn back and wave to her.\n[1967-12-16T21:15:00] Factory courtyard | I saw her stop in front of the pile of firewood. She flipped through The Blue Fairy, and suddenly threw it into the fire. I saw her in that outfit, and couldn't tell she was a woman.\n[1967-12-20T10:00:00] Home | I knew I never told her what was in my book, nor when it would be published.\n[1967-12-20T10:05:00] Home | I knew I hadn't even told her about my fiancé Pietro, or our plan to get married in two years.\n[1967-12-20T10:10:00] Home | I thought about how her life had deeply affected me, and it took me several days to recover. I clearly felt my own reality, and she completely brought me back to myself — which self was really mine?\n[1967-12-20T10:15:00] Home | I saw that the manuscript had one hundred and thirty-nine pages, printed on thick paper, and the words I had written in my notebook were now set in type. I thought about it, and it made me feel strange and unfamiliar.\n[1967-12-20T10:20:00] Home | I saw that I had spent several hours re-reading and revising this book.\n[1967-12-20T10:25:00] Home | I saw that the weather outside was very cold, and the wind was coming in through the cracks in the door and the windows.\n[1967-12-20T10:30:00] Home | I saw myself sitting at the kitchen table, and Gianni and Elisa were also studying at that same table.\n[1967-12-20T10:35:00] Home | I saw my mother moving about us with careful, delicate movements, afraid of disturbing us. I thought to myself that it was something that surprised me.\n[1968-01-01T10:00:00] Years later | I saw my heart soften, and I touched his cheek, comforting him, showing understanding for his strong reaction. I thought, as for me, I must admit that many years later, when he told me about this incident, I felt I understood Antonio's thoughts.\n[1968-01-01T10:05:00] Years later | I saw him turn red and he spoke incoherently, saying he didn't want me to think he was an animal. \"I heard 'Later, I pulled him up, he was dazed, I accompanied him to a pharmacy, I left him at the entrance of the pharmacy, then I returned to Mergellina, and I told Pasquale and Enzo about it.'\"\n[1968-01-15 18:00:00] Street of Stazione Centrale | I knew the relationship between Lina and Enzo had already been unstable, and after Pasquale appeared, their relationship changed again.\n[1968-01-15 18:00:30] Street of Stazione Centrale | I know that Pasquale is working at a construction site nearby, and he came to Stazione Centrale to attend a meeting of the Italian Communist Party.\n[1968-01-15 18:01:00] Street of Stazione Centrale | I saw a very accidental opportunity: he met Enzo on the road, and they immediately resumed their previous relationship. They talked about politics and both showed their dissatisfaction.\n[1968-01-15 18:01:30] Street of Stazione Centrale | I saw that at first, Enzo spoke very carefully. I thought, but what was astonishing was that, despite Pasquale holding an important position in Mergellina, he freely criticized his own party, talking about revisionism and the unions.\n[1968-01-15 20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw the two of them becoming friends again. When Lina came home for dinner and saw Pasquale there, she had to make something to eat for him too.\n[1968-01-15 20:30:00] Lina's house | I thought back to that evening, which had already not gone well from the start. She felt as if Pasquale was scrutinizing her, and she had to make a great effort not to get angry.\n[1968-01-15 20:30:30] At Lina's house | I thought about what Pasquale wanted to do—spy on her? Then tell the people at Mergellina about her life. Who did he think he was to judge her?\n[1968-01-15 20:31:00] At Lina's house | I saw him without saying a single friendly word, without telling her about the family, the countryside, her brother Rino, and Fernando.\n[1968-01-15 20:31:30] Lina's house | I saw his gaze, which was a bit like the looks of the men in the factory—measuring and weighing, and if she noticed, he would turn his eyes away.\n[1968-01-15 20:32:00] At Lina's house | I thought Pasquale must have found her ugly now, and he was surely thinking: What was I thinking, how could I have fallen in love with this woman when I was a child? I really am an idiot.",

I heard, \"You clean up the table, I'm going to bed.\"\n[1968-01-15 20:33:30] At Lina's house | I heard that, but at this moment, Pasquale spoke in a tone he only used on important occasions, somewhat excitedly: \"Lina, before you go to sleep, there's something I want to tell you. There's no woman in the world like you. Your life is full of strength. If everyone in the world had this kind of strength, our world would have already changed.\" I thought it was astonishing.\n[1968-01-15 20:34:00] At Lina's house | I saw him break the deadlock in this way, he told Lina that Fernando had started mending shoes again, and Rino had become a complete burden for Stefano, constantly asking him for money; people rarely saw the Nongia, because she seldom went out.\n[1968-01-15 20:34:30] At Lina's house | I heard him emphasize at the end: \"But you did the right thing, with the whole Mergellina, no one could have done it like you, humiliating Karrachi and the Solara family, I'm on your side.\"\n[1968-02-01 20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw Pasquale bringing four hot pizzas home for dinner. I knew that after that evening, they met often, which had a big impact on Lina and Enzo's correspondence courses.\n[1968-02-01 20:30:00] At Lina's house | I know he usually plays such a role: as if he clearly understands how the capitalist world and the anti-capitalist world work. Their friendship deepens further.\n[1968-02-01 20:30:30] At Lina's house | I thought it was obvious that he had no emotional life; his sister Pinocchia had just found a boyfriend and didn't have time to take care of him. He combated his loneliness with a fiercely active attitude, which was the kind of attitude Lina liked, and it also made her curious.\n[1968-02-01 21:00:00] Construction Site/Street | After a day of work on the construction site, even though he was completely exhausted, he still took care of union matters. He would go to the American embassy and throw blood-red paint on its gate. He would stand at the front, fighting with those Fascist members. He would attend meetings between workers and students, arguing passionately with the students.\n[1968-02-01 21:00:30] At Lina's house | I know, there's no need to mention the work of the Italian Communist Party: from his own perspective, he made many criticisms, which could get him removed from his position as branch secretary at any time.\n[1968-02-01T10:00:00] Porto | I saw it quickly, and I went to Porto again. This time, going to Porto was my first time taking a taxi in my life.\n[1968-02-01T18:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw the bald editor, who had been busy all day making final revisions, and he said to me at last. I heard, \"I'll call a taxi for you.\"\n[1968-02-01T18:05:00] Porto | I saw that I couldn't refuse.\n[1968-02-02T10:00:00] Train Station Borgo | I saw myself taking a train from Porto to Borgo, and at th eBorgo train station, I looked around, thinking. I thought, \"Why not? I'll be a rich lady for a while.\"\n[1968-02-02T16:00:00] Garibaldi Square | I saw myself returning to San Gregorio Armeno, and when I reached Garibaldi Square, I had that thought again.\n[1968-02-02T16:05:00] Place: Garibaldi Square | I thought about taking a taxi, comfortably sitting in the backseat, arriving at our Mergellina, arriving at my front door, with a dedicated driver who would get out to open the door for me—that would be really impressive.\n[1968-02-02T16:10:00] Piazza Garibaldi | I saw it, but I still took the bus back. I thought to myself that I felt I couldn't do it.\n[1968-02-02T16:30:00] Mergellina | I thought, but there must be something about me that makes me different.\n[1968-02-02T16:35:00] Mergellina | I saw myself greeting Pinocchia, who was pushing her daughter in a stroller outside.\n[1968-02-02T16:40:00] Mergellina | I saw her glance at me carelessly, then walk past me, but later she stopped, took a few steps back, and said to me.\n[1968-02-02T16:45:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"You look really healthy, I didn't even recognize you. You've become a different person.\"\n[1968-02-02T16:50:00] Mergellina | I thought I was happy at that moment, but I soon felt sad. What was the point of becoming someone else?\n[1968-02-02T16:55:00] Mergellina | I thought about being the person I used to be, bound by Lina, the courtyard, the lost doll, Don Achille, and everything else--that was the only way I could truly feel what was happening.\n[1968-02-02T17:00:00] Mergellina | I thought that from another perspective, I found it hard to resist such changes, and during that period, my changes were even greater than those I experienced during the years I spent at Borgo.\n[1968-02-05 20:00:00] At Lina's house | I saw how he could talk freely with Enzo and Lina, mixing personal feelings with politics.\n[1968-02-05 20:05:00] Lina's house | I heard him complain, \"You know, who is the new leader of the Fascist party now? It's Gino, the pharmacist's son—the fool servant of Michele. Do I have to watch the Fascist faction rise again in my Mergellina?\"\n[1968-02-05 20:10:00] Lina's house | I saw him speaking very excitedly. I heard, \"My father gave everything to the organization, for what? For this diluted anti-Fascist ideology? For the shit situation we're in today?\"\n[1968-02-05 20:15:00] At Lina's house | I heard Pasquale angrily say that the poor man had been wrongfully imprisoned, he was innocent, Don Achille wasn't killed by him, it was the party that had abandoned him.\n[1968-02-05 20:15:30] At Lina's house | I know he was an outstanding party member. He took part in the struggle of \"San Gregorio Armeno Four Days,\" and fought on the Bridge of the Saints. After the war, in Mergellina, he was more noticeable and fearless than anyone else.\n[1968-02-05 20:16:00] At Lina's house | When Pasquale mentioned my mother, he placed Gennaro on his knee and asked. I heard, \"Giusy—his mother, was she ever supported? Was she ever helped? Look how beautiful your mother is, do you love her?\"\n[1968-02-05 20:20:00] Lina's house | I thought about Lina listening to all this, and sometimes she felt that she should have accepted the young man, the first one who discovered her.\n[1968-02-05 20:20:30] Lina's house | I thought she shouldn't have set her sights on Stefano, and his money, nor should she have put herself in such a difficult position for Nino. She should have stayed in her own place, kept her head clear, and not let vanity cloud her judgment.\n[1968-02-05 20:21:00] Lina's house | I thought of Pasquale's attacks, which made her feel as if she had once again returned to her childhood, surrounded by the cruelty of Mergellina, Don Achille, and the fact of his murder, something she had often told about since childhood, filled with all sorts of details, and now she felt as though she were actually there.\n[1968-02-05 20:21:30] At Lina's house | At that moment, I remembered the scene when Pasquale's father was arrested—the carpenter's cries, and his wife and daughter Pinocchia.\n[1968-02-05 20:22:00] At Lina's house | I thought she didn't like the situation at all, the real memories mixed with false ones, and she saw violence and blood.\n[1968-02-05 20:22:30] At Lina's home | I saw her pull away from Pasquale's resentment, and to calm herself down, she shifted the conversation to his family celebrating Christmas and Carnival together, and to his mother Giuseppina's excellent cooking. I thought about it, which made her feel uncomfortable; she had come to her senses.\n[1968-02-05 20:23:00] At Lina's house | I thought about this, and he quickly realized that Lina, like him, had also lacked the care of family.",

    "text": "[1968-02-15 20:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that later, once he appeared without warning, full of joy as he spoke to her. I heard, \"Look, who I've brought you.\" I thought about him bringing the Grecia with him.\n[1968-02-15 20:05:00] At Lina's house | I saw my mother and daughter embracing, and Monica cried for a long time. She had brought Gennaro a little wooden Pinocchio made of cloth.\n[1968-02-15 20:10:00] Lina's house | I saw that Lina initially was happy about her mother's arrival, but when Nunzia started criticizing the choices her daughter had made, Lina spoke to her. I heard, \"Mom, either we pretend nothing happened, or you go back.\"\n[1968-02-15 20:15:00] At Lina's house | I saw Nungi getting angry, so I went to play with the children, as if really talking to them, and she said that several times. I heard, \"Your mother has to go work, risking her life in the factory. Poor child, who's going to look after you?\"\n[1968-02-15 20:20:00] At Lina's house | At that moment, I saw, and Pasquale realized he had done a foolish thing. I heard him say that it was late and he had to go.\n[1968-02-15 20:20:30] Lina's house | I saw Nonna stand up, complaining to her daughter in a voice that was both threatening and pleading. I heard, \"You once made us live like wealthy people, now you've ruined us.\"\n[1968-02-15 20:21:00] At Lina's house | I heard, \"You're brother feels abandoned. He doesn't want to see you anymore. Your father pretends he never had a daughter. Lina, please, I'm not saying you should get back together with your husband, that's already impossible, but at least you need to clear things up with the Solara family, because of you, the brothers have taken everything back. Now your father, Rino, and our whole Lina family are nothing.\"\n[1968-02-15 20:22:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina there, listening to her, and in the end, she almost pushed my mother out of the house. She said. I heard her say, \"Mom, you'd better not come back.\" She said the same thing to Pasquale.\n[1968-03-01 08:00:00] Lina's house | I know Lina has too many issues to deal with: guilt toward Gennaro, guilt toward Enzo, the hardship of work, overtime, Bruno's harassment, and pressure from her own family again.\n[1968-03-01 08:00:30] At Lina's house | I saw Pasquale's appearance didn't really help, but it was annoying. Lina was cold towards him, but he never got angry. He always came over in a good mood.\n[1968-03-01 08:01:00] At Lina's house | I know, but his main purpose was to bring Lina into his organization.\n[1968-03-01 08:01:30] Lina's house | I saw him persuade Lina to join the union, even though she didn't want to. She finally did, just to make Bruno Socavo uncomfortable.\n[1968-03-01 08:02:00] At Lina's house | I saw him bringing Lina all sorts of brochures, which were clear and concise, covering issues such as salaries, negotiations between workers and bosses, the composition of wages, and so on.\n[1968-03-10 14:00:00] Kiyaya Coast | I saw him taking Lina, Enzo, and the child to the Chiara Coast, where there was a protest against the Vietnam War. The protest eventually turned into a brawl: Fascist members were provoking, colliding with the police, stones were flying everywhere, Pasquale started hitting people, Lina was cursing, and Enzo began regretting that they had brought the child to such a mess.\n[1968-03-15 20:00:00] The location: The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | I know that two things happened during that phase, which were especially important for Lina.\n[1968-03-15 20:00:30] The location: The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | I remember once when Pasquale insisted that she come to hear a report by an important figure from the Italian Communist Party.\n[1968-03-15 20:30:00] The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | I saw her, but she wasn't really listening to the man's report—basically about the Party and the working class—because this female party member was late. When she finally arrived, the meeting had already started, and Gennaro was making a lot of noise. She had to calm him down, taking him out onto the street to play and then bringing him back in again, going in and out several times.\n[1968-03-15 21:00:00] The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | I thought about the few words she had overheard by chance, which were enough for her to realize how different this woman was from her audience—those workers and petite bourgeoisie.\n[1968-03-15 21:00:30] The scene of the Italian Communist meeting | I thought, so when she realized that Pasquale, Enzo, and several others were very dissatisfied with the person giving the lecture, she felt they shouldn't have been like that. They should have been grateful to this cultured woman for coming here and wasting her time on them, which was a praiseworthy thing to do.\n[1968-03-15 21:10:00] The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | I saw that after, Pasquale also spoke, but his words were provocative. The woman was very angry and said in a trembling voice. I heard, \"Enough, now I'm leaving.\"\n[1968-03-15 21:10:30] The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | I thought about Lina's reaction to the female party member and felt she had done the right thing, but as usual, there were all sorts of conflicting emotions in her heart.\n[1968-03-15 21:11:00] The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | At that moment, I heard Enzo support Pasquale, shouting, \"Comrade, without us, you wouldn't be here. So stay put, we'll let you go when it's time.\"\n[1968-03-15 21:11:30] The scene of the Italian Communist Party meeting | As I thought this, Lina suddenly changed her attitude. She saw herself as part of the violent \"we,\" and the woman deserved what she got.\n[1968-03-15 21:30:00] Lina's house | I saw her storming back home with the child, and that evening was ruined because of the kid.\n[1968-04-01 20:00:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I knew about the meeting organized by Pasquale, and it unsettled me even more; he was simply too eager.\n[1968-04-01 20:00:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I know Lina went because Pasquale cared about her going, and she also thought it was a good thing that Pasquale was so eager to delve into the workers' situation.\n[1968-04-01 20:10:00] Court Road Conference Site | I know the meeting was held at the court on San Gregorio Armeno, and that evening they went there in Pasquale's car. Later, they climbed some steps that were old but still impressive.\n[1968-04-01 20:15:00] Court Road Conference Site | I saw that the place was large, but there were few people present.\n[1968-04-01 20:20:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought about Lina, who could immediately tell the difference between students and workers. She also saw the leaders acting effortlessly, while ordinary people stammered.\n[1968-04-01 20:30:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought of something that had made her very unhappy—she found those students insincere. They put on an air of approachability, spoke in a showy way about their knowledge, but in the end, they always said the same thing: \"We're here to learn from you.\"\n[1968-04-01 20:30:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought what they meant was to learn from the workers, but in reality, they were showing off their knowledge of capital, exploitation, the betrayal of the social democrats, and class struggle, which could be said to be overly clear-cut in terms of ideology.\n[1968-04-01 20:31:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought, and then I realized that among the few girls present, they usually kept quiet, but now they were all flirting with Enzo and Pasquale, especially with Pasquale, who was more talkative, and the girls were all very warm toward him.\n[1968-04-01 20:31:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I know he was a worker, but he chose to present himself as an embodiment of the proletariat at a revolutionary meeting.\n[1968-04-01 20:32:00] Court Road Conference Site | I always saw the students arguing with each other, but when he and Enzo spoke, they were all nodding eagerly.\n[1968-04-01 20:35:00] Court Road Conference Site | I saw Enzo, as usual, speaking few but meaningful words, but Pasquale kept talking, using a mix of dialect and Italian, about the progress of his work in the suburbs, then questioning the students about what they had done, criticizing their lack of enthusiasm.\n[1968-04-01 20:40:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I was reading until the end, and suddenly Pasquale mentioned Lina. He mentioned her name, saying she was a communist member who worked in a small food factory. He said a lot of good things about her.\n[1968-04-01 20:40:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw Lina's eyebrows furrow, her eyes narrowing—she didn't like being looked at by everyone as if she were a rare animal.",

    "text": "[1968-04-01 20:41:00] Court Road Conference Site | I saw Pasquale finish speaking, and at that moment, a girl spoke up—she was the first among the few women present to speak. I thought this made Lina even more annoyed: first, because she spoke as if she were reading from a book; second, because she mentioned Lina several times, calling her Comrade Lina; the third reason was that she knew the girl—she was Nadia, the daughter of Professor Galiani, Nino's former girlfriend, the girl who had written love letters to Nino on Ischia.\n[1968-04-01 20:41:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought at first she was worried that Nadezhda would recognize her, but the girl kept looking at her while talking, showing no sign of recognition. Besides, how could she possibly recognize Lina? Who knew how many parties of wealthy people she had attended; her mind must be full of people.\n[1968-04-01 20:42:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought about it, but a few years ago, Lina had only one chance, that gathering left a deep impression on her.\n[1968-04-01 20:42:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought of how clearly she remembered: the house was on Vittorio Emanuele Street, she had seen Nino, and those young men from good families, the books, the paintings, and the pain she felt, as well as her terrible situation at that time.\n[1968-04-01 20:43:00] Court Road Conference Site | I saw Nadia still talking, but Lina could no longer stand it and got up, leaving with Gennaro.\n[1968-04-01 20:43:30] Outside the Conference Venue at Court Road | I thought she had a pain inside her, which made her stomach churn, but she couldn't find a way to release it.\n[1968-04-01 20:50:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw that after a while, she returned to the hall, and she decided to speak about her experience instead of acting as if she didn't matter.\n[1968-04-01 20:55:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw that now a curly-haired young man was talking about the Italian metallurgy industry and payment according to work, and he spoke very thoroughly.\n[1968-04-01 21:00:00] Court Road Conference Site | I saw Lina wait for him to finish. She ignored Enzo's anxious glance and asked to speak.\n[1968-04-01 21:05:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw her talking for a long time, speaking in standard Italian, while Gennaro kept squirming in her arms.\n[1968-04-01 21:05:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw her speaking slowly at first, then her voice grew louder and louder, perhaps too loud in the silence around us.\n[1968-04-01 21:06:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard her jokingly say that she didn't have the slightest idea what the working class was, only knowing the men and women workers at the place where she worked. She said there was absolutely nothing worth learning in these people besides their poverty.\n[1968-04-01 21:06:30] Court Road Conference Site | \"Can you imagine?\" she asked. \"What's it like to spend eight hours a day with water up to your waist, soaking in the water used to boil big sausages?\"\n[1968-04-01 21:07:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard that when they took the bones out, her hands were all cut up. Can you imagine?\n[1968-04-01 21:07:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard that when you go in and out of the ice warehouse in twenty degrees below zero, you earn ten lira an hour—ten lira—as a frostbite allowance. Can you imagine?\n[1968-04-01 21:08:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I wondered, if you could imagine, what you could possibly learn from people who are forced to live this way?\n[1968-04-01 21:08:30] Court Road Conference Site | I heard the female workers being touched on the buttocks by the foreman or other colleagues, but they didn't dare say a word.\n[1968-04-01 21:09:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard that if the boss's son has a need, you have to go with him to the storage room. That's what his father or grandfather started doing. Before taking advantage of you, the boss's son would also give you an inspiring dialogue about how excited he was by the smell of sausage.\n[1968-04-01 21:09:30] Court Road Conference Site | I heard that in the factory, both men and women are searched. At the exit, there's a \"detector.\" If it turns red instead of green, it means you have sausage or fat sausage on you.\n[1968-04-01 21:10:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard that the \"detector\" was controlled by the guard, who was the boss's right-hand man. Sometimes when the red light went on, it wasn't because someone was stealing, but because a pretty, shy girl walked by, and the guard wanted to tease her a little.\n[1968-04-01 21:10:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard that this is the situation where I'll be working. The union people have never been able to get inside. These workers are just pitiful people, risking their lives under the boss's control and oppression. The boss's law is: I pay you, so I own you. I own your life, your family, everything around you. If you don't do what I say, I'll destroy you.\n[1968-04-01 21:11:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw that at first, no one said a word. Finally, the others kept quoting what Lina had said.\n[1968-04-01 21:15:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw Nadia come over and embrace her, saying a lot of flattery: \"You're so beautiful! You're amazing! You spoke so well!\" I heard her thanking Lina and saying very seriously, \"You've shown me how much work we still have to do.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:15:30] Court Road Conference Site | I thought that although Nadya's tone was high and her manner solemn, Lina still saw her as the little girl she had known years ago, the girl who was with Nino, even more childish than she had been back then.\n[1968-04-01 21:16:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I wondered what her son with Nino was doing at that moment? Were they dancing, talking, rubbing against each other, [intimate acts]? She couldn't imagine it.\n[1968-04-01 21:16:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I thought, of course, that Nadia was beautiful back then, unforgettable. Now, her appearance seems even more pure, so innocent, so fragile, so considerate of others' pain, as if she could truly feel the workers' suffering. This empathy seemed unbearable for her.\n[1968-04-01 21:17:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard, \"Are you coming back?\"\n[1968-04-01 21:17:05] Court Road Conference Site | \"I have a child.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:17:10] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard, \"You need to keep coming to the events, we need you.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:17:15] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw Lina shaking her head uncomfortably, and she repeated it to Nadia. I heard, \"I have a child.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:17:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw her point Gennaro out to Nadia and say something to Gennaro. I heard, \"Say hello to this lady, tell her you can read and write, let her listen to how well you speak.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:18:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I saw Gennaro holding Lina around the neck, blocking her face. Nadia was nodding and smiling, but Lina didn't see her.\n[1968-04-01 21:18:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I heard her say to Nadia, \"I have a child, I work eight hours a day, not counting overtime. People in my situation always just want to go to sleep as soon as they get off work.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:19:00] Court Road Conference Site | I thought that in the end, she was exhausted, and she felt she had exposed herself too much in front of others.\n[1968-04-01 21:19:30] Court Road Conference Venue | I suppose so, they're all good people. Although they understand those abstract things very well, they may not be familiar with the specific situation.\n[1968-04-01 21:20:00] Court Road Conference Venue | I know—Lina thought, but didn't say—what it's like to live a life of wealth and good intentions, something you can't even begin to imagine the real meaning of poverty.",

I heard, \"How do you work, the two of you? How do you work?\"\n[1968-04-01 21:32:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that they didn't answer. I thought about how tired they must be, and this was something everyone clearly knew.\n[1968-04-01 21:33:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that at least Enzo would see, in the factory, how some female workers were worn down by hard labor, humiliated, and burdened with housework, and that they weren't any easier off than Lina.\n[1968-04-01 21:33:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought of the two men, both wearing gloomy expressions because of her work situation, and they couldn't stand it.\n[1968-04-01 21:34:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that for these men, it was necessary to hide everything.\n[1968-04-01 21:34:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how they would prefer not to know anything, how they would rather pretend that the things the bosses did in the factory would miraculously never happen to the women they cared about—that was the mindset they'd had since childhood. They should protect their women, a responsibility they couldn't escape even if it meant being killed.\n[1968-04-01 21:35:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about their silence, which made Lina even more angry.\n[1968-04-01 21:35:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard her say, \"Fuck them!\" She said, \"You, and others.\"\n[1968-04-01 21:40:00] On Pasquale's car | I saw them get into the car and head to Stazione Centrale; we only exchanged a few casual words along the way.\n[1968-04-01 22:00:00] Lina's house downstairs | I saw Pasquale drop them off downstairs, and Pasquale spoke seriously to Lina. I heard there's nothing to say, you're still the best.\n[1968-04-01 22:05:00] Lina's building downstairs | I saw and then he drove back to Mergellina.\n[1968-04-01 22:10:00] Lina's house downstairs | I saw Enzo holding a sleeping child in his arms, his face dark as he muttered something under his breath. \"I heard, 'Why have you never told me? Did someone touch you at the factory?'\"\n[1968-04-01 22:10:30] Lina's building downstairs | I saw that they were all tired, so Lina decided to calm him down and said to him. I heard, \"They won't do anything to me.\"\n[1968-04-01T10:00:00] Home | I saw that the book was published in the spring. I thought it was more important than my graduation from university; it gave me a new identity.\n[1968-04-01T10:05:00] Home | I showed my new book to my mother, my father, and my brothers and sisters. They looked at it silently, but no one turned the pages to read its contents.\n[1968-04-01T10:10:00] Home | I saw them with a smile full of disbelief. I thought of how someone like Labor Office was facing a fake document.\n[1968-04-01T10:15:00] Home | I saw what my father said. I heard, \"This is my family name.\"\n[1968-04-01T10:20:00] Home | I saw it, but when he said it, he didn't sound very satisfied. I thought, as if suddenly he wasn't proud of me, but rather had discovered that I had stolen money from his pocket.\n[1968-04-05 07:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw Lina arrive at work early in the morning, and because there was so much to do, she was flustered and rushed. I knew that the problem would arise a few days later.\n[1968-04-05 07:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that the weather was very cold. I thought about how she had been coughing for several days, and she felt like she had a cold.\n[1968-04-05 07:01:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw her at the factory gate, where she saw a few boys. I thought she might be a student skipping class.\n[1968-04-05 07:01:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw one of them greet her warmly and hand her a typeset booklet, instead of just giving her a flyer as before.\n[1968-04-05 07:02:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw her greet the boy as well, her gaze a bit anxious. I know that Lina saw him at the party congress on the way to the court.\n[1968-04-05 07:02:30] Front of Sokaowo Meat Factory | I saw her put the brochure into her coat pocket, and when she passed by the guard Philip, she didn't even look at him.\n[1968-04-05 07:03:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I heard Philip shouting at her at that moment: \"Hey! At least say hello, we've never even said 'good morning' to each other.\"\n[1968-04-05 10:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw her still working as hard as before, and in that phase she was working in the deboning area. I thought about how she had forgotten the boy she met at the door.\n[1968-04-05 13:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | When I saw her bringing her lunchbox to the factory courtyard for lunch, she was looking for a corner to eat. At that moment, Philip saw her and left his booth, walking toward her.\n[1968-04-05 13:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I know he's a man in his fifties, short and heavyset. He has a lecherous side that makes people sick, but sometimes he also likes to be friendly and familiar. Recently, he had a son, and he gets easily moved. He often takes out his son's photo from his wallet and shows it to everyone.\n[1968-04-05 13:01:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I saw the man pull out a brochure from his jacket pocket and say, with a threatening tone, in a harsh way. I thought Lina saw him coming and expected him to show her the photo of his son, but that wasn't what happened.\n[1968-04-05 13:01:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | \"I heard you, Seru! Listen carefully: if what's written here is something you told those rotten people, you're in big trouble, you understand?\"\n[1968-04-05 13:02:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Courtyard | I saw her say coldly. I heard, \"I don't know what the hell you're talking about, I'm going to eat.\"\n[1968-04-05 13:02:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I saw Philip angrily throw the brochure into her face and say. I heard, \"You don't know, do you? You'll see for yourself. The people here have always been very friendly, there's no real conflict. Only someone like you, a bitch, would go around talking about this outside.\"\n[1968-04-05 13:03:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Courtyard | \"I can turn on the alarm whenever I want? I touched those female workers? As the head of the family, a man with children, how could I do something like that? You'll see, I'll tell Boss Bruno, and you'll pay for it. You dirty woman, I really want to tear your face apart.\"\n[1968-04-05 13:03:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Courtyard | I saw him say that, then he turned and walked back to the booth.\n[1968-04-05 13:10:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I watched Lina calmly finish her lunch. She picked up the brochure and saw its overly dramatic title: \"San Gregorio Armeno and the Living Conditions of Workers in the Suburbs.\"\n[1968-04-05 13:15:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I saw her flip through it and noticed there was an entire page filled with Via Caracciolo.\n[1968-04-05 13:15:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I thought of how she had seen every word she had spoken at the meeting on the way to court.",

    "text": "[1968-04-05 13:20:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw her act as if nothing had happened, dropping the brochure on the ground without looking back at the doorman, and walked straight into the factory to start working.\n[1968-04-05 13:25:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought about it, but she was filled with anger toward the person who had caused her so much trouble without even informing her beforehand. That little saint, Nadia—this article must be hers! The writing was overly sentimental, the tone manipulative—clearly her work.\n[1968-04-05 13:30:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw Lina holding a knife, working on the cold meats. I thought of that nauseating smell, which made her anger even more intense.\n[1968-04-05 13:35:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought about how she must feel the hostility from her colleagues, both men and women, all showing the same attitude. They had worked together for a long time, and they all knew they were being exploited, but no one said a word.\n[1968-04-05 13:40:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I wondered who had exposed the matter here? They all unquestionably believed it was her. Because she was the only one who had shown this attitude from the beginning: willing to work hard and even risk her life, but never to be humiliated.\n[1968-04-05 16:00:00] Bruno's Office | I saw that afternoon, Bruno appeared, and not long after, he sent someone to call her. I saw his face was even redder than usual, and he was holding that brochure.\n[1968-04-05 16:05:00] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"You did this, didn't you?\" \"No.\" \"Tell me the truth, Lina! Are you also getting involved in the chaos outside?\" \"I told you, it wasn't me.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:05:30] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"Ah, you don't? No one here has the ability, nor the nerve, to come up with these lies.\" \"Maybe it was some employee who said it.\" \"An employee is even less likely.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:06:00] Bruno's Office | I saw him sigh, as if he were really certain it was her. I heard him say, \"What do you want me to do? Birds sing, should I make them stop? Everyone says it's your fault.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:06:30] Bruno's Office | \"I gave you a job, and you joined the union. I said nothing. If it had been my father, he would have kicked you out right away. Okay, in the drying room, I did something stupid, but I apologized to you. You can't say I forced you.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:07:00] Bruno's Office | \"I heard, 'Why are you saying these things now? Are you taking revenge? You've defamed my factory, you've written it down in black and white, saying I took the female workers to the drying room. Are you crazy? What do I have to do with those female workers? I really regret helping you.'\"\n[1968-04-05 16:07:30] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"Help me? I work my fingers to the bone every day, and that's all you give me. Rather than saying you're helping me, maybe I'm the one helping you.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:08:00] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"Did you see? You're talking just like those bastards, the way you spoke to them. You wrote these things, so admit it.\" \"I didn't write anything.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:08:30] Bruno's Office | I saw Bruno snort and glance at the book in front of him. I thought she understood, but he hesitated, unsure of what to do: should he threaten her with a harsher tone, fire her, or step back and find out if there were other similar actions being planned?\n[1968-04-05 16:09:00] Bruno's Office | I saw that she had made up her mind. She spoke in a low voice—though reluctant, she still forced a flattering expression, suppressing the vivid memories of his invasion—she said three compromising words. I heard, \"You have to believe me. I have a child at home. I really didn't do it.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:09:30] Bruno's Office | I saw him nod, muttering something discontentedly. I heard, \"Do you know what you're forcing me to do?\" \"No, I don't want to know.\"\n[1968-04-05 16:10:00] Bruno's Office | I heard, \"I still have to tell you. If it was your friend who did it, tell them: if they dare to cause trouble in front of the factory again, I'll beat them so badly they won't want to come back. As for you, be careful: if you keep talking, the rope will break.\"\n[1968-04-05 18:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I know, but that day didn't end there. When Lina passed by the booth on her way out, the alarm went off.\n[1968-04-05 18:00:30] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I know it's still the same old routine—every day, the gatekeeper selects three or four victims, those shy girls who lower their eyes and let him touch them, and those women who smile and say, \"Hurry up, if you want to touch, go ahead, I have to go cook dinner.\"\n[1968-04-05 18:01:00] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw this time Philip blocked Lina, and the doorman came out of the small house. I saw that the weather was very cold, and the wind was strong.\n[1968-04-05 18:01:30] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw Lina trembling as she said. I heard, \"If you dare so much as touch a single finger of mine, either I'll kill you myself, or I'll have someone else do it.\"\n[1968-04-05 18:02:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw Philip's face was dark and gloomy. He pointed to a table next to the booth, which had always been there. I heard, \"Take the things out of your pocket and put them on top of this.\"\n[1968-04-05 18:02:30] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw a fresh sausage in Lina's pocket, and she took it out. I saw her touch the soft meat inside the intestine.\n[1968-04-05 18:03:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw her suddenly laugh and say. I heard, \"You're all crap, all of you are the same.\"\n[1968-04-05 18:05:00] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw Philip scold her, threatening to report her for stealing, to deduct her salary, and to fine her. She retaliated against Philip. I thought about how Bruno never showed up when the incident happened, even though he was always at the factory, his car still parked in the yard. Lina felt that from that moment on, her situation would only get worse.\n[1968-04-05 19:00:00] At Lina's home | I saw her return home, more exhausted than usual. She was harsh with Gennaro because the child wanted to stay at the neighbor's house. She began preparing dinner.\n[1968-04-05 21:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her tell Enzo she couldn't study the correspondence course with him, and then she went to sleep in an intimate way.\n[1968-04-05 21:30:00] At Lina's house | I saw that her body still wouldn't warm up. She got up, put on a sweater over her nightgown, and then lay back down again.\n[1968-04-05 22:00:00] At Lina's house | I thought there was no direct reason for it, but her heart suddenly jumped to her throat, beating so hard that she felt it was someone else's heart.\n[1968-04-05 22:00:30] Lina's house | I knew she had experienced such symptoms before, along with other hallucinations—eleven years later, in 1980, she would call this sensation \"the dissolution of boundaries\"—but this time, it was stronger than any previous occurrence.\n[1968-04-05 22:01:00] At Lina's house | I thought, especially, that this was the first time she was alone, with no one around, and before, these symptoms had occurred because of one reason or another.\n[1968-04-05 22:01:30] Lina's house | I thought about how she realized, amid her waves of fear, that she wasn't alone. From her uncontrollable mind came the people she had met and the voices she had heard that day.\n[1968-04-05 22:02:00] Lina's house | I thought of those people floating around in the room—the gatekeeper, the laborer, Nadia, the two boys I met at the meeting, Bruno who appeared in the drying room—like a silent film, their movements all fast, the red light of the alarm flashing rapidly, including Philip, who snatched the sausage from her hand and loudly threatened her, all moving as if fast-forwarded.\n[1968-04-05 22:02:30] Lina's house | I saw that there was no one else in the room besides Gennaro; the child was lying on the small bed next to him, breathing steadily. I thought all of this was a trick of the mind, that there were no other real people or voices, but this didn't calm her down—it only made her more afraid.\n[1968-04-05 22:03:00] At Lina's house | I thought of her heart pounding so violently that it seemed to push everything around her apart, making the tight interlocking of things loosen. Even the walls of the room seemed less solid. Her heart pounded fiercely against the bed beneath her, as if it might crack the plaster on the walls or loosen her skull, perhaps even harm the child.\n[1968-04-05 22:03:30] Lina's house | Yes, I thought, maybe he would be destroyed like a celluloid doll, his chest, belly, and brain would split open, exposing his internal organs. She thought: I should stay away from him. The closer I get to him, the more likely I am to hurt him.\n[1968-04-05 22:04:00] Lina's house | I know, but she remembered another child who had left her—the child who had never even formed in her womb, the son of Stefano, the one I had expelled from my body, at least that's what Pinocchia and Giggia said behind my back.\n[1968-04-05 22:04:30] At Lina's house | I thought maybe it was true, and I had deliberately pushed him out of my body. Up until now, I hadn't accomplished anything. Why should I keep those broken pieces?\n[1968-04-05 22:05:00] At Lina's house | I saw her get up again from the bed and sit on the edge of it. I saw her covered in sticky cold sweat, and she felt it was like cold oil.\n[1968-04-05 22:05:30] At Lina's house | I saw her place her bare feet on the edge of Gennaro's bed and gently push them forward, trying to move him a little, but not too far away. I thought of the child by my side, and I worried about hurting him.\n[1968-04-05 22:06:00] Lina's house | I saw her taking small steps toward the kitchen, leaning against the furniture, leaning against the wall, but she kept looking back over her shoulder. I thought about the floor sinking in and taking Gennaro with it.\n[1968-04-05 22:06:30] At Lina's house | I saw her take some water from the faucet and splash it on her face. Suddenly, her heart stopped, and her whole body lurched forward as if there had been a sudden brake.",

    "text": "[1968-04-05 22:07:00] Lina's house | I saw it end, and the surrounding world began to rejoin, her body gradually restored. She wiped her face. Now she was trembling. I thought of how exhausted she was, so much that the walls around her seemed to spin, and she feared she might faint.\n[1968-04-05 22:07:30] Lina's house | I thought: I should go find Enzo. I need to get warm. I want to get into his bed, to embrace him from behind as he sleeps, and fall asleep. But she gave up.\n[1968-04-05 22:08:00] Lina's house | I thought of her, of the fawning smile on her face—that expression she made when speaking to Bruno: \"You have to believe me. I have kids at home. I really didn't do it.\"\n[1968-04-05 22:08:30] Lina's house | I thought that although she felt disgusted, it was a natural reaction of a woman's body—a kind of feminine allure, perhaps even seductive. She felt ashamed: how could she have acted that way, said those words, knowing what Sokolov had done to her in the drying room?\n[1968-04-05 22:09:00] At Lina's home | I just thought of it! Like a docile little beast, clinging to those men—this isn't what she wants to do! It can't go on like this anymore!\n[1968-04-05 22:09:30] At Lina's house | I knew that in the past, for different reasons, she had done things like this, sometimes without realizing it, and she had ended up in such situations with Stefano, Nino, Solara, or even with Enzo, but she no longer wanted to go through that again.\n[1968-04-05 22:10:00] Lina's house | I thought about how she, too, was imagining those scenes: the gatekeeper, her coworkers, those students, the unrelenting expectations that Soca had for her. In the collision with these people and situations, she felt exhausted, on the verge of breaking down.\n[1968-04-05T10:00:00] Home | A few days later, I saw the initial comments, and I anxiously scrolled through them. Any slight criticism hurt me deeply.\n[1968-04-05T10:05:00] Home | I saw myself reading those exaggerated praises out loud to the Posillipo person. I saw my father's face brighten.\n[1968-04-05T10:10:00] Home | I saw Elena joking. I heard, \"You should sign your name as Elena, Elena sounds terrible.\"\n[1968-04-06 06:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her wake up, and she realized she had a fever. She took some aspirin and still went to work.\n[1968-04-06 06:30:00] On the way to the factory | I saw that it wasn't yet fully light, with a faint blue glow outlining the low buildings around me, as well as the grass growing in the mud puddles and the trash by the roadside.\n[1968-04-06 06:40:00] On the way to the factory | I saw her just as she reached the dirt path leading to the factory. When she rounded the puddles, she noticed there were four students there this time. Two of them she had seen the day before, the third was about the same age as them, and the fourth was a boy around twenty years old, very strong and definitely overweight.\n[1968-04-06 06:40:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw them putting up slogans on the factory wall, calling on workers to join the fight, and they also distributed flyers with the same message. I know that if the day before, those male and female workers had taken the flyers out of curiosity or politeness, but now most of them just kept their heads down and hurried by. Even if they took the leaflets, they would immediately crumple them up and throw them away.\n[1968-04-06 06:41:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I thought about how Lina got annoyed when she saw those students already there, conducting political work as punctually as if they were at work, which was even more annoying than her own job. This feeling later turned into hostility.\n[1968-04-06 06:41:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw one of the boys who had appeared the day before recognize her, holding a large stack of flyers, and run toward her enthusiastically to ask. I heard, \"Comrade, everything all right?\"\n[1968-04-06 06:42:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw Lina didn't look at him. I thought of her sore throat, the pulsing at her temples.\n[1968-04-06 06:42:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the boy following her, hesitatingly saying. I heard, \"This is Dario. You might not remember me—we met on the court road.\"\n[1968-04-06 06:43:00] The entrance of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw her suddenly erupt, saying. I heard, \"I know who you are! But I don't want anything to do with you, or your friends.\"\n[1968-04-06 06:43:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw Dario dialogueless, slowing his steps and almost talking to himself. I heard, \"You don't want a flyer?\"\n[1968-04-06 06:44:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I thought about Lina, who didn't answer because she didn't want to say anything more hurtful. She kept thinking about the boy's bewildered face, the expression that seemed to say: he believed he was right, but couldn't understand why others didn't agree with him.\n[1968-04-06 06:44:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I thought to myself, perhaps she should explain properly: why, during the meeting, she had said those words; why those words later appeared in the brochure, and why that made her feel unbearable; why she thought the four students' actions were foolish, a waste of time.\n[1968-04-06 06:45:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I thought they should still be in bed, or about to go to class, but instead they were braving the cold, handing out these papers covered with words. But the factory workers had trouble reading, and there was no need for them to struggle to read these things—they already knew the situation here, it was the reality they faced every day.\n[1968-04-06 06:45:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I thought they could tell even worse, more embarrassing things—things no one had ever said, written, or read before—revealing the real reasons behind their exploited situation. But she was feverish, and she was tired of all this; she didn't have the energy to talk about it.\n[1968-04-06 06:46:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw that when she reached the factory gate, the situation became even more complicated. The guard was yelling at the oldest, fat boy in dialect, he said. I heard, \"Try crossing this line, then you'll be entering private property without permission. See if I dare to shoot.\"\n[1968-04-06 06:46:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the student was also very excited. He laughed and answered—like that loud laugh of mockery—he laughed and cursed, shouting in Italian. I heard, \"You, guard dog, fire your gun, let me see how you fire. This isn't a private estate. Everything here belongs to the people.\"\n[1968-04-06 06:47:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw Lina walk past them, and she spoke seriously to Philip. I heard, \"Give in to his request, don't waste your breath. A man who could be sleeping at home or in school, yet comes here to cause trouble, should just be shot.\" I knew this scene well—how many times had she seen it before: Rino, Antonio, Pasquale, even Enzo, were all masters at it.\n[1968-04-06 06:47:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the gatekeeper see her, hear her words, and his mouth opened in astonishment. I thought about whether he wanted to find out if she was truly encouraging him to do this crazy thing, or just teasing him.\n[1968-04-06 06:48:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw it, but the student took it completely seriously. His face was filled with anger as he stared at her and shouted at her. I heard, \"Go on, go in, go lick the boss's ass!\"\n[1968-04-06 06:48:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Entrance | I saw him shaking his head and stepping back a few paces, handing out flyers more than two meters away from the gate.\n[1968-04-06 06:50:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I saw Lina walk into the courtyard. I realized it was only seven in the morning, and she was already exhausted. She felt her eyes ached, and eight hours of work seemed an endless torment to her.\n[1968-04-06 06:50:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Yard | I saw that at this moment, a screech of brakes came from behind her, followed by a man's shout. She turned around and saw two cars had driven up here, one was gray and the other was blue.",

    "text": "[1968-04-06 06:51:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Courtyard | I saw people had already gotten down from the first car, and they were starting to tear down the slogans that had just been posted on the wall. I'm in trouble! Lina thought, and instinctively stepped back, although she knew she should rush inside like everyone else to start work.\n[1968-04-06 06:51:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw her step back a few paces, clearly seeing that the person sitting at the wheel of the gray car was Gino. She saw him open the car door.\n[1968-04-06 06:52:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw he was very tall, all muscles, and when he got out of the car, he was holding a stick in his hand.\n[1968-04-06 06:52:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the others—the people who had torn down the posters—and they lazily got out of the car, maybe seven or eight of them, holding chains and iron rods. I knew these people were all members of their Mergellina Fascist group, and Lina recognized a few of them.\n[1968-04-06 06:53:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Entrance | I knew they were all members of Fascist, like Stefano's father Don Achille, and Stefano himself later became one too. They were also like the Soleras—the grandfather, the father, and the grandson. Although for the sake of interest, they occasionally aligned with the monarchists or the Christian Democratic Party, in essence, they were all members of Fascist.\n[1968-04-06 06:53:30] The entrance of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I thought about how she had always hated them since childhood, imagining all their crimes. Later, she felt she couldn't get rid of them, couldn't reset everything, and the connection between past and present could not be severed. Most people of Mergellina still supported them, loved them, and would go to great lengths to fight for them whenever needed.\n[1968-04-06 06:54:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw Dario, the boy she had met on the way to court. He was the first to take action. He ran over and stopped the people tearing down the posters. He still had some flyers in his hand. I thought to myself: Get rid of it quickly, idiot!\n[1968-04-06 06:54:30] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw him, but he didn't do it. She heard him speak in Italian to the people tearing down the posters, saying, \"Don't do that, you don't have the right to do this.\"\n[1968-04-06 06:55:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | At that moment, I saw him turn to his companion for help—he couldn't fight at all. I know that in her world of Mergellina, when someone fights, they have to stare directly at their opponent. People don't talk much; they just glare and shout to scare the other person. At the same time, they attack, beating the other person as hard as they can without letting up, until someone stops them. If someone can hold them back, they'll stop.\n[1968-04-06 06:55:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw the people tearing down the banners, one of whom did exactly that: he said nothing, gave no warning, and punched Dario in the face, sending him sprawling to the ground among the scattered flyers. Then the man stepped forward and kept hitting him. I saw the flyers flying around me also seemed shaken by this brutal scene.\n[1968-04-06 06:56:00] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | At that moment, the overweight student ran over to help the boy who had fallen to the ground, but he was bare-handed. Before he could get there, he was blocked by a man holding a chain, which struck his arm.\n[1968-04-06 06:56:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the fat student grab the chain and try to pull it away; the two of them struggled for a few seconds, exchanging bitter insults.\n[1968-04-06 06:57:00] Front of Soka Wo Meat Factory | I saw that, when Gino came from behind and hit the fat student with a stick.\n[1968-04-06 06:57:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | At that moment, I saw Lina had forgotten she was feverish and had also forgotten her exhaustion. She ran to the gate, but she didn't have a specific purpose. I thought she wasn't trying to see more clearly, nor was she trying to help the students—no, it was simply that she was acting as she always did, driven by instinct. Fighting and brawls didn't scare her; they only ignited her anger.\n[1968-04-06 06:58:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw her, but she didn't have time to come onto the road because a group of workers was rushing into the factory.\n[1968-04-06 06:58:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw people trying to stop those who were beating others with sticks, of course Elena and others, but we couldn't stop the Fascist members, and they all scattered and ran away.\n[1968-04-06 06:59:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the men and women scattering in all directions under the threat of two men wielding iron rods. There was a woman named Isra, an office worker, who ran while shouting at Philip. I heard, \"Hurry up, do something, call the police!\"\n[1968-04-06 06:59:30] Sokavo Meat Factory Gate | I saw that at this moment, Edo's hand was bleeding, and he was shouting to himself. I heard, \"I'll get the axe now, and we'll settle this.\"\n[1968-04-06 07:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw the end result: when Lina reached the dirt road, the blue car had already started, and Gino was about to get into the gray car.\n[1968-04-06 07:00:30] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I saw him recognize Lina and stop in astonishment, saying. I heard, \"Lina, you ran all the way here?\"\n[1968-04-06 07:01:00] Sokavo Meat Factory entrance | I watched until he was pulled into the car by a companion, and the car started moving. He shouted loudly from the window. I heard, \"You used to be a rich lady, look at you now, what a miserable mess you've become!\"\n[1968-04-06 10:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that Lina spent the entire day at work in a state of anxiety. I thought, as usual, she was masking her anxiety with disdain or arrogance.\n[1968-04-06 10:30:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought that everyone made her understand: this factory, which had once been peaceful and quiet, now had a suddenly tense atmosphere, and it was all her fault.\n[1968-04-06 11:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I know, but soon the factory workers split into two factions. The first was a minority who wanted to meet during lunch break; they wanted to take advantage of the current situation and encourage Lina to go to the boss and bring up the idea of a raise. The other faction was the majority, and they no longer paid attention to Lina. They opposed any measures that would make their lives more complicated, because life was already hard enough.\n[1968-04-06 11:05:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that Edo belonged to the first group; his hand pain made him very irritable, and he said to someone who disagreed with him. I heard, \"If my hand got infected, I'd go to your house, pour a bucket of gasoline in, and burn you and your whole family.\" I know there's no possibility of agreement between these two groups.\n[1968-04-06 12:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw Lina completely ignoring both sides; she isolated herself, working diligently all the time, as efficient as usual, paying no attention to gossip, insults, or even the cold. I thought about her, but she kept wondering what awaited her. In her fevered mind, a variety of thoughts swirled: What had happened to those students who had been beaten? What trouble had they caused her? Where had they run off to?\n[1968-04-06 12:05:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought that Gino would definitely be spreading rumors about her throughout Mergellina, and he would tell Michele about every single thing.\n[1968-04-06 12:10:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought it would be a disgrace if she turned to Bruno, but there really was no other way out. She was worried about being fired, worried about losing her meager salary, which, although small, still allowed her to love Enzo without making him the foundation of her life with Gennaro.\n[1968-04-06 12:15:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I kept thinking, and finally, she thought of the terrible night before. What had happened? Should she go to the doctor? If the doctor found out she was sick, what would happen to her job, her child? She had to be careful, not get too excited. She needed to sort her thoughts out.\n[1968-04-06 13:00:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I saw that during lunch break, she was too worried to wait, so she went to find Bruno herself. I thought about how she was going to talk to Bruno about the prank with the sausage, and about the Fascist molecule that Gino had brought, and she would reassert that she had done nothing wrong.",

    "text": "[1968-04-06 13:05:00] Sokavo Meat Factory Toilet | I saw that before she went to Bruno, she still locked herself in the bathroom, fixed her hair, and put on a little lipstick. I thought, despite despising myself.\n[1968-04-06 13:10:00] Outside Bruno's Office | I saw the secretary say that Bruno wasn't here and that he wouldn't come all week. I thought she was becoming more and more uneasy, more and more anxious.\n[1968-04-06 13:15:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought she wanted to talk to Pasquale and have him tell those students not to come to the factory gate anymore. She thought, if the student members of the union stopped coming, the Fascist elements would disappear too, and the factory would gradually calm down, returning to its previous order.\n[1968-04-06 13:20:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought, but how could I find Pasquale Peluso? She didn't know which construction site he was working at. Go to Mergellina to look for him? She felt she couldn't do it. She was worried about running into her mother, father, especially her brother. She didn't want to have a conflict with her brother.\n[1968-04-06 13:25:00] Sokavo Meat Factory | I thought about all her own problems, and she was at her wit's end. In the end, she decided to go straight to Nadezhda.\n[1968-04-06 17:00:00] Lina's house | I saw her run home after work and leave a note for Enzo to make dinner.\n[1968-04-06 17:15:00] Lina's house | I saw her put a coat on Gennaro, put a hat on his head, and then switch cars one after another until they finally arrived at Vittorio Emanuele Street.\n[1968-04-06 18:00:00] Victor Emmanuel Street | I saw that there wasn't a single cloud in the sky; the sky had a soft color, and the afternoon sun was slowly fading. The wind was strong, blowing against the purple sky.\n[1968-04-06 18:05:00] Victor Emmanuel Street | I thought about how she clearly remembered the house, the gate, everything, and the humiliation she had suffered a few years ago, which made her hostility even stronger.\n[1968-04-06 18:06:00] Victorio Emmanuele Street | I know that in that house, she and I once went up together to attend a party. I thought about everything that had happened in the past—it was so loose, constantly collapsing, falling onto her. That party had caused her a lot of pain, and now Nadia, Nino's previous girlfriend, had also come up, making her suffer even more.\n[1968-04-06 18:07:00] Victor Emmanuel Street | I saw her, but she wasn't someone who would just sit and wait. She took Gennaro's hand and went upstairs with him. I thought of what she wanted to tell Miss Nadiya: \"You and your gang have put me and my son in a difficult situation. For you, it's just a distraction, and you won't face any real problems. But for me, for my son, it's a very serious matter. So either you take some steps to save the situation, or I'll tear your face off.\"\n[1968-04-06 18:08:00] Victorio Emmanuele Street | I saw her coughing violently. I knew she really intended to say that. I thought about it and grew more and more angry; she was eager to vent her frustration.\n[1968-04-06 18:09:00] The basement of the Galiani family's house | I saw her see the door below was open, and she climbed the stairs.\n[1968-04-06 18:10:00] At Galiani's doorstep | I thought about her, about the time when I and she came here, about Stefano dropping us off, about the clothes and shoes we were wearing, and every word we said on the way back.\n[1968-04-06 18:11:00] At Galiani's doorstep | I saw her press the doorbell, and it was Professor Galiani himself who opened the door for her. I thought she was exactly like the Lina in my memory, very polite, and her home was also neat and orderly.\n[1968-04-06 18:11:30] At Galiani's doorstep | I thought that compared to others, Lina felt very dirty, her whole body reeked of raw meat. A cold made her breathing difficult, fever made her emotions all over the place, and adding to that, the child was complaining in the local dialect, which made her feel extremely embarrassed.\n[1968-04-06 18:12:00] At Galiani's front door | I saw her ask a rather abrupt question. I heard, \"Is Nadia here?\" \"No, she's outside.\"\n[1968-04-06 18:12:30] At Galiani's doorstep | I heard, \"When is she coming back?\" \"I'm sorry, I don't know. Maybe ten minutes, maybe an hour. She can come back whenever she wants.\"\n[1968-04-06 18:13:00] At Galiani's doorstep | I heard, \"Can you tell her that Lina is here looking for her?\" \"Is it an emergency?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can you tell me?\"\n[1968-04-06 18:13:30] At Galiani's doorstep | I saw Lina looked a bit confused; she glanced behind Galiani. I saw her vaguely seeing the old, aristocratic furniture and chandeliers in the house, the bookshelves that had once fascinated her and were piled high with books, and the precious old paintings on the walls. What should I tell her?\n[1968-04-06 18:14:00] At Galiani's front door | I thought: This is the environment that Nino was part of before he and I got trapped in the mud.\n[1968-04-06 18:14:30] At Galiani's doorstep | I thought: What do I really know about this side of San Gregorio Armeno? Nothing at all; I'll never live in such an environment, neither will Gennaro; I wish this place would be destroyed, burned down by fire, I wish the volcano's lava would rise all the way to the mountain's peak.\n[1968-04-06 18:15:00] At Galiani's doorstep | I saw it all, and finally, she answered. I heard, \"No, thank you, I want to speak directly to Nadezhda.\"\n[1968-04-06 18:15:30] At Galiani's front door | I saw her about to say goodbye. I thought it was a complete waste of a trip, but the discontented tone she used when talking about her own daughter made her like her.\n[1968-04-06 18:16:00] At Galiani's front door | I saw her, but she suddenly sighed in a frivolous tone. \"I heard her say, 'You know, a few years ago, I came here to a party. I was really looking forward to it, but later I found it annoying and couldn't wait to leave.'\"\n[1968-04-07 10:00:00] Court Road | I knew from the beginning that this would fall on Lina. She was trying to buy time, entrusting Gennaro to the neighbors, and went with Pasquale to a meeting held on the way to the court. I thought the meeting was mainly about the Via Caracciolo issue.\n[1968-04-07 10:15:00] Court Road | I saw Lina show everyone the document she had prepared for Capone. I know there were a total of twelve people attending, including Nadia, Nadia, Isabella, and Pasquale—that was the more detailed first version.\n[1968-04-07 10:20:00] Court Road | I saw Nadia look carefully, and finally she said. I heard, \"Pasquale is right, you never back down; you've done a lot of work in a short time.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:21:00] Court Road | I saw her then, speaking in a sincere and appreciative tone about the political and union work mentioned in the document, and also praising Lina's writing style. I heard, \"You're really amazing, writing these materials this way—it's truly refreshing! Still, I don't recommend you go directly to Socalo right away.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:25:00] Court Road | I saw that Nadia also held the same view, he said. \"I heard, 'We have to wait until our strength is stronger, until the timing in Via Caracciolo is more mature. We've taken a very important step, and we can't act recklessly, or all our previous efforts will be in vain.'\"\n[1968-04-07 10:26:00] Court Road | I saw Dario ask, \"What advice do you have?\" Nadia answered, but she was speaking to Lina. I heard, \"We need to hold another meeting, invite more people, we need to meet your fellow workers as soon as possible, we need to strengthen your organization. We can start with your materials and make a brochure.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:27:00] Court Road | I heard, \"You think I went through all that trouble, risking my job, just to get you to hold another meeting and make another brochure?\" I felt a great sense of satisfaction at their sudden cautious attitude, and she joked.\n[1968-04-07 10:28:00] Court Road | I saw, suddenly, she saw Nadezhda tremble like a piece of glass not properly fixed, then shatter. I thought of her, but she was unable to enjoy the kind of triumph that had prevailed.\n[1968-04-07 10:28:10] Court Road | I saw her, and every small movement of everyone present was speeding up, including furrowing brows. I thought there was no specific trigger, and Lina felt as if she couldn't breathe.\n[1968-04-07 10:28:20] Court Road | I saw her close her eyes, her shoulders leaning against the creaking back of the chair beneath her. I thought she felt as if she were suffocating.\n[1968-04-07 10:29:00] Court Road | I saw Nadia ask, \"What's wrong with you?\" said Pasquale, who was uneasy. I heard, \"She's too tired, Lina, what's wrong with you? Do you want a glass of water?\"\n[1968-04-07 10:30:00] Court Road | I saw Dario run to get her water, Nadia took her pulse, and Pasquale was very worried, constantly asking her. \"I heard, 'How are you feeling? Spread your legs, breathe.'\"\n[1968-04-07 10:31:00] Court Road | I saw Lina whisper that she was fine, and then she suddenly pulled her arm away from Nadya's grasp. I heard her say she just wanted a minute of silence.\n[1968-04-07 10:32:00] Court Road | I saw Dario bring the water, she took a small sip and whispered. I heard she's fine, just has a cold.\n[1968-04-07 10:33:00] Court Road | \"I heard 'Are you feverish?' Nadezhda asked her calmly. 'Not today.'\"\n[1968-04-07 10:33:10] Court Road | I heard, \"Are you coughing? Is it hard to breathe?\" \"A little, I feel like my heart is in my throat.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:33:20] Court Road | I heard, \"Are you feeling better now?\" \"Yes.\" \"Come to another room for a moment.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:35:00] Court Road | I saw Lina didn't want to go, but she was worried. In the end, she followed Nadezhda's advice and, with great difficulty, stood up and entered another room with Nadezhda. I know Nadia was carrying a black leather bag with a gold clasp.\n[1968-04-07 10:36:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw them enter a room that Lina had never seen before. The space was large and cold, with three cots on which the mattresses looked dirty. There was also a wardrobe, a broken mirror, and a drawer cabinet.\n[1968-04-07 10:37:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw her lying weakly on a bed, and Nadia asked her about her symptoms. I heard her say nothing at all, only that she felt short of breath, and then she added at last: \"Nothing serious.\" I know that since she had the baby, she has never seen a doctor.\n[1968-04-07 10:40:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw Nadia silently examine her. I thought about how she hated his silence, how she saw it as a sinister silence--that clean, cold man asking you questions, but seeming not to believe your answers at all.\n[1968-04-07 10:41:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw him use his knowledge and tools to verify those issues through inspection. I thought that your body was the most reliable, capable of providing the answer to him.\n[1968-04-07 10:42:00] Another room on Court Road | I watched him use the stethoscope to listen to her heartbeat, then take her pulse with his hand. He looked at her intently, but didn't immediately say what was wrong with her chest, stomach, or throat. I thought these were all familiar organs on the surface, but at this moment, she felt everything was strange.\n[1968-04-07 10:43:00] Another room on Court Road | I heard the end of it, and Nadia asked her, \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Very well.\" \"How long did you sleep?\" \"It varies.\" \"How can it vary?\" \"It depends on what's on your mind.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:43:30] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"How about eating?\" \"Eat when you feel like it.\" \"Have you ever had trouble breathing?\" \"No.\" \"Does your chest hurt?\" \"My chest feels a bit tight, but it's not serious.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:44:00] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"Did you break out in a cold sweat?\" \"No.\" \"Did you ever pass out or feel like you were about to pass out?\" \"No.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:44:30] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"Are you regular?\" \"What?\" \"Menstruation.\" \"Not regular.\" \"When was your last one?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:45:00] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"You don't remember the date?\" \"Do I need to?\" \"It's better to write it down. Are you using protection?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Condoms, IUDs, and pills.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:45:30] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"What medicine?\" \"It's a new drug. Once you take it, you won't be [in a reproductive state].\" \"Is that true?\" \"Absolutely true. Doesn't your husband ever use a condom?\"\n[1968-04-07 10:46:00] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"I don't have a husband anymore.\" \"He left you?\" \"I left him.\" \"When you were together, did he use it?\" \"I didn't even know what a condom looked like.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:46:30] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"Do you have a regular sex life?\" \"What's the point of talking about such things?\" \"If you don't want to, we won't talk about it.\" \"I don't want to.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:48:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw Nadia putting his tools into her bag, and he sat on a sunken stool, taking a breath. I heard, \"Take it easy, Lina, you don't care enough about your health.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:48:30] Another room on Court Road | \"I don't understand,\" I said. \"You're malnourished, your health is damaged—you're neglecting your body too much.\" \"What else?\" \"You have some phlegm. I'll prescribe some syrup for you.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:49:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw Nadia shaking her head unhappily, he said. I heard, \"And then?\" \"You should have a series of tests, your liver is slightly enlarged.\" \"I don't have time to get tested, just give me some medicine.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:50:00] Another room on Court Road | \"I heard you say, 'Listen, maybe we shouldn't beat around the bush: you have static.'\" \"What?\" \"It's a heart problem, and it might not be a good sign.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:50:10] Another room on Court Road | I saw Lina's face showing an anxious expression. \"I don't understand, am I going to die?\" I asked. He smiled and said, \"No.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:50:30] Another room on Court Road | I heard, \"You should go see a cardiologist, get checked out. Come to the hospital tomorrow and I'll introduce you to a very skilled doctor.\"\n[1968-04-07 10:51:00] Another room on Court Road | I saw Lina's brow furrow, and she said coldly. I heard, \"I have something to do tomorrow, I need to go find Soccavo.\"\n[1968-04-07 11:30:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw Pasquale driving Lina home, asking her questions all the way. I thought of Pasquale's worries, which she couldn't stand.\n[1968-04-07 11:31:00] In Pasquale's car | I heard \"What did Nadia say? Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine. I should eat more.\" \"You saw, you don't take care of yourself.\"\n[1968-04-07 11:32:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw Lina say impatiently. I heard, \"Pascal, you're not my father, you're not my brother, you're nothing to me. Stay out of my life. Do you understand?\"\n[1968-04-07 11:32:30] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"Can't I show a little concern for you?\" \"No, be careful what you say and what you do, especially in front of Enzo.\"\n[1968-04-07 11:33:00] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"If you tell him about my condition today—that's not even a real illness, I just feel a bit dizzy—our friendship is over.\"\n[1968-04-07 11:34:00] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"Don't rush to look for Sokolov. Take a couple of days to rest. Caponi also doesn't recommend you go right away. The committee doesn't recommend it either. It's a matter of political timing.\"\n[1968-04-07 11:35:00] In Pasquale's car | I heard, \"I don't care about political timing or anything like that: you're the ones who got me into trouble, and now I'll do whatever I want.\"",

    "text": "[1968-04-07 12:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that she didn't even invite him upstairs to sit down, and he left angrily.\n[1968-04-07 19:00:00] Lina's House | I saw her return home, where Lina and Gennaro were affectionate for a while, then started preparing dinner while waiting for Enzo to come back. I thought about how she had always felt short of breath.\n[1968-04-07 20:00:00] Lina's house | I waited and waited, but Enzo never came back, so she let Gennaro eat first. I thought she was worried that Enzo had gone to see a woman and was coming home late.\n[1968-04-07 20:30:00] Lina's house | I saw that, and when she saw the child spill a glass of water, she immediately lost all her patience and tenderness.\n[1968-04-07 20:30:10] Lina's house | I saw her start to scold the child in dialect, as if he were an adult. \"I heard, 'Can you just be quiet for a while? Do you want me to slap you? Why are you tormenting me like this? Do you want to ruin my life?'\"\n[1968-04-07 21:00:00] Lina's house | I saw that just then Enzo had returned, and she tried hard to look enthusiastic. I thought about it, but when they ate together, Lina found it hard to swallow, as if the food was stuck in her chest.\n[1968-04-07 22:00:00] Lina's House | I saw that as soon as Gennaro fell asleep, they started studying the distance learning course from Zurich, but Enzo soon got tired. Several times, he politely asked to go to sleep, but it didn't work—Lina kept going on until very late.\n[1968-04-07 23:00:00] Lina's house | I thought about how afraid she was of being alone in the room, of experiencing the previous symptoms. She was afraid of being alone in the dark. The symptoms she hadn't told Nadia about would immediately resurface, all at once, and would kill her.\n[1968-04-07 23:10:00] Lina's house | I heard Enzo ask her softly, \"Tell me, what's wrong with you?\" \"Nothing,\" she said. \"You went out with Pasquale and came back together. Why? What's the secret between you two?\"\n[1968-04-07 23:10:30] Lina's house | I saw Enzo make a disappointed face, and she asked, \"What's wrong?\" I heard, \"It's all about the union. I've already joined the union, and now I have to do something.\"\n[1968-04-07 23:11:00] Lina's house | I heard that Pasquale told me about what you did at the factory. You told him, and everyone on the committee. Why am I the only one who isn't allowed to know?\n[1968-04-07 23:12:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina become very agitated all of a sudden; she stood up and went to the bathroom. I couldn't help but think about Pasquale, what exactly had he told Enzo?\n[1968-04-07 23:12:10] Lina's House | I wondered if he had only mentioned the union's plan to hold an event at Via Caracciolo? Could he have also mentioned Gino and the moment she nearly fainted on Court Road?\n[1968-04-07 23:12:20] Lina's House | I knew he couldn't keep silent. I thought about the principles of friendship between men, though they were not written down, they were solid and different from friendships between women.\n[1968-04-07 23:13:00] Lina's House | I saw her pull the chain of the water tank and return to Enzo, saying. I heard, \"Pasquale is a traitor.\" \"Pasquale is a friend. Who are you?\"\n[1968-04-07 23:13:30] Lina's House | I saw the harshness in his tone, and she suddenly fell apart, which was almost unexpected—her eyes were filled with tears, and she desperately tried to hold them back, but she couldn't. I thought of this sudden fragility, which made her feel deeply humiliated.\n[1968-04-07 23:14:00] Lina's house | \"I've caused you a lot of trouble already, I don't want to trouble you anymore,\" she cried, \"I'm scared you'll send me away.\" I heard her sniff, and then she whispered, \"Can I sleep with you?\"\n[1968-04-07 23:14:30] Lina's house | I saw Enzo looking at her in disbelief. \"I heard 'How are you going to sleep?' 'Do whatever you want.' 'Do you really want to sleep with me?'\"\n[1968-04-07 23:15:00] Lina's house | I saw Lina staring at a teapot placed in the center of the table, she said. I heard, \"The most important thing is that you let me stay by your side.\" I knew it was Gennaro's favorite teapot because it had a rooster's head on it.\n[1968-04-07 23:15:30] Lina's house | I saw Enzo shaking his head unhappily. I heard, \"You don't want me.\" \"I do want you, but I just don't feel anything right now.\" \"Don't you feel anything for me?\"\n[1968-04-07 23:16:00] Lina's House | I heard, \"What are you saying? I love you so much. Every night I hope you'll come and call me, hold me, but besides that, I don't think of anything else.\"\n[1968-04-07 23:16:30] Lina's House | I saw him ask further. I saw Enzo's face turn very pale, that handsome face was slightly distorted, as if he were enduring an unbearable pain.\n[1968-04-07 23:17:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"Am I making you feel sick?\" \"No, no, that's not it. We can do whatever you want, we can start right away, I'm already ready.\"\n[1968-04-07 23:17:30] Lina's house | I saw a sad smile on his face. He was silent for a while, and then, unable to bear making her uneasy, he muttered something. I heard, \"Let's go to sleep.\" \"Everyone goes to their own room?\" \"No, come to my room.\"\n[1968-04-07 23:20:00] Lina's room of Enzo | I saw Lina sigh in relief. She had changed into her nightgown and was shivering from the cold. When she reached his room, he was already in bed. I heard, \"I'll sleep here?\" \"Okay.\"\n[1968-04-07 23:21:00] Enzo's room at Lina's house | I saw her suddenly slip under the covers, her head resting on his shoulder, one arm draped across his chest. Enzo stayed there, motionless. I felt the intense heat radiating from him as soon as I saw her.\n[1968-04-07 23:22:00] Lina's room of Enzo | \"I'm cold,\" she said, \"can I lie next to your feet?\" \"Sure.\" \"Can I touch you?\" \"No need.\"\n[1968-04-07 23:30:00] Lina's room of Enzo | I saw that slowly, she was no longer cold, the pain in her chest had disappeared, and the feeling of something stuck in her throat was gone. She was immersed in a warm, drowsy haze.\n[1968-04-07 23:31:00] Enzo's room at Lina's house | I heard her say, \"Can I go to sleep now?\" She was so tired she was already getting drowsy. \"Go to sleep,\" I said.\n[1968-04-08 06:00:00] Enzo's room at Lina's house | I saw her suddenly wake up at dawn; her body reminded her it was time to get up. I suddenly thought of many terrible things, all very clear: the possibility that I had a heart condition, Gennaro's decline, the Mergellin aFascist molecule, Nadia's show-off, Pasquale's unreliability, and the demands I had made to the workers.\n[1968-04-08 06:01:00] Lina's room with Enzo | I realized then that I was sleeping with Enzo, but he was no longer in the bed.\n[1968-04-08 06:05:00] Lina's House | I saw her get up quickly, and at that moment, she heard the sound of the door closing. Did I think about Enzo leaving after she fell asleep? Had he spent the whole night awake? Was he sleeping in another room with the child? Or had he forgotten all his desires and was sleeping with her instead?\n[1968-04-08 06:10:00] Lina's house | I saw, of course, he ate breakfast alone, setting the table for her and Gennaro. He left for work without saying a word, lost in thought.\n[1968-04-08 07:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw Lina entrust her son to a neighbor and then go to work as well. Amedo asked her somewhat unhappily. I heard, \"Have you made up your mind?\"\n[1968-04-08 07:01:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw Lina had returned to her previous tone. I heard, \"I can go whenever I want.\" \"We're together, you have to let us know.\" \"Have you already shown everyone that list?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1968-04-08 07:02:00] Via Caracciolo | I heard, \"What do the others say?\" \"Not speaking is the same as agreeing,\" she said. \"No,\" she said, \"not speaking means you're too scared to talk.\"\n[1968-04-08 07:10:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw Lina once again cut the meat with great concentration. I thought Caponi was right, and Nadia was right too: this plan was too fragile, too forced.\n[1968-04-08 07:11:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought about how she wanted to hurt others, and also herself. She wanted to drive the knife into her palm, and now she hoped the blade would slide from the dead flesh on her hand to her living flesh.\n[1968-04-08 07:12:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought of her desperate need to scream, to rush toward others, making them responsible for her inner imbalance.\n[1968-04-08 07:13:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought of it! Lina, Lina, you really never learn, why did you make that list?\n[1968-04-08 07:13:10] Via Caracciolo | I thought you didn't want to be exploited? You wanted to change your own situation and that of these people? Are you sure that starting from here, from your current situation, you and they could unite with the proletariat around the world and take a path that leads to victory?\n[1968-04-08 07:13:20] Via Caracciolo | I thought you were overthinking it! What kind of path are you taking? What kind of person are you going to become? Always just a worker? A worker who spends all day hunched over work? A worker who's supposed to be the master of his own life?\n[1968-04-08 07:13:30] Via Caracciolo | I was so naive, thinking that words sounded good, but in the end, I still had to work.\n[1968-04-08 07:13:40] Via Caracciolo | I thought you also knew, you've always known, this situation is terrifying and should be eliminated, not improved.\n[1968-04-08 07:13:50] Via Caracciolo | Am I thinking about changing my situation to become a better person? For example, have you improved? Have you become Nadia or Isabella?\n[1968-04-08 07:14:00] Via Caracciolo | Did your brother get better? Has he become Nadia? Has your son become like Marco?\n[1968-04-08 07:14:10] Via Caracciolo | I thought, no, they are them, and we are still us. Then why don't you just accept your fate?\n[1968-04-08 07:14:20] Via Caracciolo | I thought it was all because your mind never calmed down, it kept turning: designing shoes, figuring out ways to set up a shoe workshop, rewriting Nino's article, forcing him to follow your ideas, getting Enzo to join you, using the materials from the Zurich correspondence courses your way.\n[1968-04-08 07:14:30] Via Caracciolo | I thought to myself, now you want to show Nadia: if she's going to make a revolution, you'll be more revolutionary than her.\n[1968-04-08 07:14:40] Via Caracciolo | I think of your mind, yes, the most fundamental reason is here, because your mind isn't satisfied, and now your body is breaking down too.\n[1968-04-08 07:14:50] Via Caracciolo | I thought: I'm tired of myself, I'm tired of all this, I'm even tired of Gennaro: if things go smoothly, his fate will be to be just a worker, groveling before some boss for an extra five lire.\n[1968-04-08 07:15:00] Via Caracciolo | What am I supposed to do with you? Lina, you have to take responsibility and carry out the plan you've been thinking about all along: scare Sokolov a bit, make him stop his habit of molesting the female workers in the drying room.\n[1968-04-08 07:15:10] Via Caracciolo | I thought you wanted him to see what you had prepared for this college student with a wolf's face.\n[1968-04-08 07:15:20] Via Caracciolo | I thought about that summer in Ischia, about the drinks, the Mergellina house, the luxurious bed where she and Nino had slept. All the money came from this place, from this stinking place, from the days spent in this disgusting environment, from this cheap labor and hard work.\n[1968-04-08 07:15:30] Via Caracciolo | What did I cut into? A pile of yellow stuff oozed out from the meat, really disgusting. I thought about how the world keeps turning, how things change for the better. It's good, if it falls, it will break.\n[1968-04-08 13:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw her make a decision during lunch, and she told it to Edo. I heard \"I'll go talk to the boss.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:05:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw her, but before she could take off her apron, the boss's secretary appeared at Via Caracciolo and spoke to her. I heard, \"Mr. Soccavo wants you to go to his office immediately.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:06:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw her put down her work and take out the petition from the small closet, then she went upstairs. I thought that Lina must have already been informed to Bruno by a spy.\n[1968-04-08 13:07:00] Sokavo Office | I saw her knock on the office door and go inside. I saw not only Bruno in the room, but also someone sitting on the sofa, a cigarette in his mouth — it was Michele.\n[1968-04-08 13:07:05] Sokavo Office | I know she knows, Michele will eventually reappear in her life. I thought of him, but seeing him in Bruno's office made her afraid, just like when she was a child and feared the ghosts that appeared in the dark corners of the house.\n[1968-04-08 13:07:10] Sokavo Office | I thought: What is he doing here? I should leave right away.\n[1968-04-08 13:07:20] Sokavo Office | I saw it, but Michele saw her and immediately stood up. He opened his arms, looking really excited, and spoke in Italian. I heard, \"Lina, it's a real honor! I'm really glad to see you.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:07:30] Sokavo Office | I saw him trying to embrace Lina, and if she hadn't blocked him with an involuntary expression of revulsion, he would have embraced her.\n[1968-04-08 13:07:40] Sokavo Office | I saw him for a few seconds, Michele standing there with his arms outstretched, somewhat embarrassed. He touched his cheekbones and the back of his neck with one hand, then pointed at Lina with another finger, saying to Socafo—this time in a false tone. I heard, \"You see, I just can't believe it: you really hid Mrs. Carracci in the sausage factory.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:08:00] Sokavo Office | I saw Lina speak to Bruno in a stiff tone. I heard, \"I'll come back later.\" \"Sit down!\" Bruno said, his face dark. \"I just want to stand.\" \"Sit down, or you'll get too tired.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:08:30] Sokavo Office | I saw her shaking her head, still standing there, and Michele gave a meaningful smile to Soccavo. I heard, \"You give up, she's like that, she never listens to you.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:09:00] Sokavo Office | I saw that she had changed her mind, perhaps to save her strength, perhaps to disobey him, and she sat down. I thought about Lina, and Michele's voice sounded more powerful than before. He enunciated every word clearly, as if he had been practicing his pronunciation for these past few years.\n[1968-04-08 13:09:30] Sokavo Office | I saw Michele also sit down and keep talking to her, as if from that moment on, Bruno had already left the room. I heard Michele speak with a polite expression, looking at her carefully and saying in a tone of regret: \"Your hands are ruined, it's really a shame. When you were a girl, your hands were so beautiful.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:10:00] Sokavo Office | I saw him talking about the shops on Martiri Square, describing them in detail as if Lina was still his employee, and they had met to discuss work. I heard him mention the shelves in the store, the new lights, and his decision to block the door to the courtyard once again.\n[1968-04-08 13:10:30] Sokavo Office | I thought of the door when I saw Lina, and she spoke in a low voice in her dialect. I heard, \"Your store has nothing to do with me.\" \"You should say our store: it's something we built together.\" \"I've never built anything with you.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:11:00] Sokavo Office | I saw Michele still smiling, he shook his head, indicating he completely disagreed. I heard him say that, just like those who use their own hands and minds, some people invest money, and that is also a form of construction and creation; money can create landscapes, situations, and people's lives.",

    "text": "[1968-04-08 13:11:30] Sokavo Office | I heard myself say, \"You don't know how many people, their happiness is all in my hands. All I have to do is sign my name, and they will either be happy or destroyed.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:12:00] Sokavo Office | I saw that, and then he spoke again calmly, as if they were good friends, and he was happy to talk to her about what had happened recently. I know he started talking about Alfonso Carracci, who had done well on the Martiri Square, and now he was earning a good amount of money and could start his own family. But Alfonso Carracci wasn't really interested in getting married; he still wanted poor Pinochietta to remain his girlfriend, and he wanted to do whatever he pleased.\n[1968-04-08 13:12:30] Sokavo Office | I heard, \"If you had continued working for me, there would have been no Alfonso Carracci. Whatever you wanted, I would have given it to you, and you would have lived like a queen.\" I knew that as a boss, he encouraged Alfonso Carracci to get married, believing that a stable family was good for the employees. Now he offered to pay for Alfonso Carracci's wedding, and in the end, they decided to hold it in June.\n[1968-04-08 13:13:00] Sokavo Office | I saw him not giving Lina a chance to speak. He flicked his cigarette ashes into an old brass ashtray and announced to her that he was also getting married, in June, of course, to Giggia—the woman of his life. I heard him say, \"I'm sorry, I can't invite you, I'd really like to, but I don't want to make your husband uncomfortable.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:13:30] Sokavo Office | I saw him start talking about Stefano, Pinocchia, and their daughter. He spoke highly of the three of them, and said that the two families were no longer as they had been before. I heard that about the Caracci family, he explained. Their life was manageable as long as their father's money hadn't run out, but now their business has been in trouble for a while.\n[1968-04-08 13:14:00] Sokavo Office | I heard, \"Like a small boat on a turbulent sea, Stefano's boat was already taking on water, and he could no longer hold on.\" I know his competitors are increasing, with new stores opening constantly.\n[1968-04-08 13:14:30] Sokavo Office | I know, for example, Marcello, who wanted to expand the already deceased Don Carlo's department store and turn it into a general store that sold everything—soap, light bulbs, sausages, and pastries. Marcello has already opened it, and it's doing incredibly well. The shop is called \"Everything You Can Imagine.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:15:00] Sokavo Office | \"I heard, 'You're saying that you and your brother made Stefano's life miserable too?' 'That's not how it is, Lina. We're just doing our own thing, we don't have any other intentions. On the contrary, if we can help our friends, we're more than willing to.'\n[1968-04-08 13:15:30] Sokavo Office | I heard, \"Guess who Marcello has working in the new store?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Your brother.\" \"You've reduced Rino to being your salesman?\"\n[1968-04-08 13:16:00] Sokavo Office | \"I heard, 'Yes, you dumped him, the young man has to support your father and mother, he has a son, Pinocchio is pregnant again. What could he do? He went to Marcello, my brother helped him out. Aren't you upset?\"\n[1968-04-08 13:16:30] Sokavo Office | I saw Lina answer coldly. \"I heard, 'No, I'm not happy at all, I don't like anything you've done.'\"\n[1968-04-08 13:17:00] Sokavo Office | I saw Michele make a very unpleasant face; he was thinking of Bruno, and said. I heard, \"You saw, just as I told you a moment ago, her problem is that she has a terrible temper.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:17:10] Sokavo Office | I saw Bruno smile awkwardly, trying to show his agreement. \"I heard, 'That's really true.'\" \"Did her temper hurt you too?\" \"A little.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:17:30] Sokavo Office | \"I heard her say, 'You know, when she was still a girl, she once put a leather-cutting knife against my brother's neck. At that time, my brother was only as tall as her? That wasn't a joke—she almost actually did it.'\"\n[1968-04-08 13:17:40] Sokavo Office | I heard, \"Seriously?\" \"Yes. That woman is something else—brave, determined.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:18:00] Sokavo Office | I saw Lina clench her fists, fighting against her weakness. I saw the room rising and falling, the dead and living things spreading out.\n[1968-04-08 13:18:10] Sokavo Office | I saw her see Michele crush his cigarette in the ashtray, using a lot of force. I thought that even though he spoke in a very calm tone, he still wanted to release his discomfort.\n[1968-04-08 13:18:20] Sokavo Office | I saw Lina staring at his fingers. I saw his fingers pressed against the cigarette butt, and his nails were slightly white.\n[1968-04-08 13:18:30] Sokavo Office | I thought about her, thinking that Michele had once wanted to become his lover, but that wasn't what he really wanted. It was something else, something entirely unrelated to intimacy, something even he couldn't explain.\n[1968-04-08 13:18:40] Sokavo Office | I saw him staring at Lina without looking away. I thought it was like a superstition, maybe he believed I had a power that was essential for him.\n[1968-04-08 13:18:50] Sokavo Office | I thought about how he wanted to gain that power, but he couldn't obtain it. He was in pain, and he couldn't take it from me by force. Yes, maybe that's how it was. If it wasn't like that, he would have already killed me.\n[1968-04-08 13:19:00] Sokavo Office | I thought, but why me? What did he see in me that was useful to him? I shouldn't be here, right under his nose. I shouldn't be listening to him. Everything he saw, everything he wanted—it all scared me.\n[1968-04-08 13:19:10] Sokavo Office | I saw Lina say to Soccavo. I heard, \"I'm leaving, and before I go, I want to give you something.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:19:20] Sokavo Office | I saw her stand up to give him the petition. I thought of this gesture, which was so meaningless to her, yet so necessary. She wanted to place the paper on the table, next to the ashtray, and then leave this room.\n[1968-04-08 13:19:30] Sokavo Office | I saw but Michele made her stop, and now his voice was filled with tenderness, almost a kind of flattery. I thought he must have already sensed it, and Lina wanted to run away from him. He tried everything possible to attract her and keep her.\n[1968-04-08 13:20:00] Sokavo Office | I saw him then say to Soccavo. I heard her say, \"You see, that's just her temper. I was talking, and she didn't care at all. She just took out a piece of paper and said she was leaving. But I forgive her because she has many good qualities that make up for her bad temper.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:20:30] Sokavo Office | I heard, \"Do you think you've just hired a servant? No, this lady isn't just a simple worker. If you let her do her job, she can turn dog excrement into gold. She can reorganize your messy stand to a level you can't even imagine.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:21:00] Sokavo Office | \"I heard, 'Why? Because she doesn't have the mind of an ordinary woman; her mind is something even we men can't keep up with. I noticed her when she was very young, really I did.'\"\n[1968-04-08 13:21:30] Sokavo Office | I heard her say, \"The shoes this woman designed are still being sold here and in other cities, and I've made a lot of money from them. She renovated my shoe store on Martiri Square, turning it into a salon for the wealthy on Via Chiara, Posillipo, and Via Masci.\n[1968-04-08 13:22:00] Sokavo Office | I heard, \"She can do a lot of other things too. But she's crazy, thinks she can do whatever she wants, comes and goes, fixes, breaks.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:22:30] Sokavo Office | I heard her say, \"Do you think I fired her? No, one day she just stopped coming to work. She disappeared as if nothing had happened. If you caught her, she'd still slip away, just like a eel.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:23:00] Sokavo Office | I heard her say, \"That's the problem: although she's very smart, she doesn't understand what can be done and what can't. It's because she hasn't found a real man. A real man would make a woman normal.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:23:30] Sokavo Office | \"I heard, 'Can't cook? You can learn. The house is too dirty? Clean it up. A real man can make a woman do anything.'\"\n[1968-04-08 13:24:00] Sokavo Office | I heard him say, \"Let me give you an example. Not long ago, I met a woman who couldn't whistle. Well, we were together for just two hours—two hot hours. I told her, 'Now, whistle.' She—you won't believe it—actually whistled.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:24:30] Sokavo Office | I heard her say, \"If you know how to train a woman, she'll be obedient. If you don't, then forget it—you'll just have to suffer yourself.\" I thought about the way he said those last words, with a very serious tone, as if stating an undeniable conclusion.\n[1968-04-08 13:25:00] Sokavo Office | At that moment, he changed his expression, and his voice also shifted. He suddenly turned to Lina and spoke in a rougher dialect, emphasizing his words more and more. I thought about it, but when he spoke, he should have realized that he himself couldn't abide by the conclusion he had set forth; he urgently needed to humiliate her.\n[1968-04-08 13:25:10] Sokavo Office | I heard him say, \"But this woman is really hard to deal with, damn it, she's a real pain in the ass. Look at her—small eyes, small breasts, small ass, now she's gotten so thin she's like a broomstick. What can you do with a woman like that? Your cock won't even get hard, but just one look at her—just one look—and you want to jump her.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:26:00] Sokavo Office | I saw her shouting loudly, using words even dirtier than Michele's. She grabbed the copper ashtray from the desk, scattering cigarette butts and ashes everywhere. She tried to hit him with the ashtray. As I thought about this, Lina felt a wild pounding in her mind, as if her heart wasn't beating in her throat, but exploding inside her skull.\n[1968-04-08 13:26:10] Sokavo Office | I saw her, and although she was angry, her movements were slow and weak, so Michele easily stopped her. He snatched the ashtray from her hand and angrily said. I heard Bruno's voice—“Lina, please, what are you doing?”—and it sounded weak and lifeless as well.\n[1968-04-08 13:26:30] Sokavo Office | \"I heard, 'Do you think you can rely on Mr. Soccavo? Do you think I don't count here? You're wrong. Mr. Soccavo has been on my mother's red book for a while now. This red book is more important than the Little Red Book, so you're not relying on him—you're relying on me, you've always relied on me, only on me.'\"\n[1968-04-08 13:27:00] Sokavo Office | \"I've let you run wild so far. I want to see what you and your friend can do. But now you need to remember—I'm watching you. If I need you, you have to come right away, understand?\"\n[1968-04-08 13:27:30] Sokavo Office | I saw that only at this moment, Bruno stood up anxiously and said something. I heard, \"Let her go, Michele! You're going too far.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:28:00] Sokavo Office | I saw Solara gently release Lina's wrist and then mutter something in Italian to Soccavo. \"I heard her say, 'You're right, I'm sorry, but Mrs. Carraci has this ability: she always makes you act completely exaggerated.'\"\n[1968-04-08 13:29:00] Sokavo Office | I saw Lina suppressing her anger. She rubbed her wrists carefully, then flicked a bit of ash off her shoulder with her fingertips. Then she spread out the paper with her request in front of Bruno. When she left, she said to Solara. I heard, \"I could whistle when I was five.\"",

    "text": "[1968-04-08 13:30:00] Factory restroom | I saw her return to the factory, her face was very pale. Aido asked her how she was, but she didn't answer. She pushed him away with one hand and locked herself in the bathroom.\n[1968-04-08 13:31:00] Factory restroom | I thought about how she was afraid Bruno might immediately call her over, how she was afraid she'd have to confront her in front of Michele, and how she was worried about her weak body that couldn't handle such a situation.\n[1968-04-08 13:32:00] Factory toilet | I saw her watching the courtyard through the small window of the toilet. Only then did she finally relax, and she returned to Via Caracciolo. I saw her looking at Michele's tall, strong body, his freshly shaven face, his broad forehead with a high hairline, and the leather jacket he was wearing over black pants. He took quick steps toward his car and drove off.\n[1968-04-08 13:35:00] Factory Via Caracciolo | I heard Edo ask again, \"How is it going?\" \"It's gone. You'll see.\" \"What do you mean?\"\n[1968-04-08 13:36:00] Factory Via Caracciolo | I saw that she couldn't answer Edo's question, when Bruno's secretary came in, out of breath, saying that the boss wanted to see her immediately.\n[1968-04-08 13:37:00] Sokavo Office | I saw her and went right away. I thought of a martyr, a saint who, though his head was still on his shoulders, already considered himself beheaded.\n[1968-04-08 13:37:10] Sokavo Office | I saw Bruno start shouting as soon as he saw her. I heard, \"Do you want me to bring you coffee to your bed in the morning? What's going on, Lina? Do you know what you're doing? I can't believe it. Sit down and explain to me.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:38:00] Sokavo Office | I watched Lina explain their requirements one by one, using the same tone she used when Gennaro was harassing her. I heard her emphasize that he had better take the things mentioned on the paper seriously, approach them with a constructive mindset, because if he couldn't handle the matter rationally, the inspectors from Labor Office would come to investigate him.\n[1968-04-08 13:39:00] Sokavo Office | I saw her ask in the end, how could he have fallen into the hands of someone as dangerous as Solara. I heard that at this point Bruno lost control. His face turned from red to purple, his eyes were filled with bloodshot veins. He shouted that he would take revenge on Lina, and that if he gave a few of his men a few more lira, they would let the matter drop.\n[1968-04-08 13:39:30] Sokavo Office | I heard him shouting, it's strange if he's afraid someone will investigate, after all his father has been giving gifts to the inspectors for years! He also said that the Solara brothers would make her give up any idea of joining the union.\n[1968-04-08 13:39:40] Sokavo Office | I heard him finally speak in a hoarse, broken voice: \"Get out, right now, get out!\"\n[1968-04-08 13:40:00] Outside the Sokavo Office | I saw Lina reach the door, and she stopped at the threshold, saying. I heard, \"This is the last time you'll see me: from now on, I won't be working here anymore.\"\n[1968-04-08 13:40:10] Sokavo Office Door | I saw and heard what he said, and Socafo immediately regained his senses. His face full of suspicion, he said to Lina. I heard, \"Now you're angry? Throwing a tantrum? What did you say just now? Come here, let's talk. Let me decide if I should fire you. You dirty woman, come here!\" I knew he must have already promised Michele not to fire her.\n[1968-04-08 13:41:00] Factory/Beach | I know the friend who has an apartment in Mergellina, a very polite and patient person. I thought that in that very moment, she remembered the time on Ischia, the mornings we spent waiting for Nino and his friends.\n[1968-04-08 13:42:00] Factory/Beach | I saw her walk out through that door and close it behind her. I thought of her, but immediately felt my whole body tremble and break out in a cold sweat.\n[1968-04-08 13:45:00] Factory/Beach | I saw her arrive at Via Caracciolo, not saying hello to Edo or Teresa, she passed by Philip's side, who looked a bit dazed as he gazed at Lina and called out. I heard, \"Sera! Where are you going? Come back inside right away.\"\n[1968-04-08 14:30:00] Beach/Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw her run along that dirt road, get on the first bus heading to the sea, and arrive at the beach. She kept walking, took the cable car to Piazza del Plebiscito, then walked through Piazza Vittorio, Via Scarpetta, Via Cimarosa, and then took the cable car back down. I saw that the wind was cold.\n[1968-04-08 21:00:00] Lina's house | I didn't realize until very late that she had forgotten Gennaro. At nine o'clock that night, Lina finally came home, and Enzo and Pasquale were both anxious, asking her what was wrong. She told them to come find me at Mergellina.\n[1968-04-08 23:30:00] Elena's House | I saw that now we had met, Gennaro was sleeping, Lina kept talking in a low voice, and Enzo and Pasquale were waiting for us in the kitchen. I saw, in the middle of the night, in this bare room at Stazione Centrale.\n[1968-04-08 23:35:00] Elena's House | I thought of myself as a knight from an old-fashioned novel, clad in a magnificent suit of armor, having accomplished countless great deeds around the world. Now I had encountered a shepherd dressed like a beggar, frail and weak, who had never left his pasture. With bare hands and astonishing courage, he had tamed and controlled some terrifying beasts.\n[1968-04-08 23:40:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw myself as a quiet listener, I had been listening to her all along. I thought to myself that I might also be living such a life, if I hadn't ended up in this situation, and that was all her fault.\n[1968-04-08 23:41:00] Elena's House | As she spoke, Lina's face would undergo a sudden, painful spasm. I thought about it, and it especially made me feel uneasy. I had a strong sense of guilt.\n[1968-04-08 23:42:00] Elena's House | I saw it, but I held back, interrupting her only two or three times at most. I think of moments when I want to embrace her, and more often, I want to ask her questions, to make comments.\n[1968-04-08 23:45:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I spoke up, of course, for example, when she was talking about Teacher Galiani and her children.\n[1968-04-08 23:46:00] Elena's House | I thought about how I had wanted to ask her in detail what the teacher had actually said about me, how she had said it, and what the exact words were. I wanted to ask her whether she and Nadia had mentioned me when they talked to Nadia.\n[1968-04-08 23:47:00] Elena's House | I thought about it, but I quickly realized that my request was crude and narrow-minded. Although from my perspective, my curiosity was reasonable, they were all people I knew and cared about.\n[1968-04-08 23:48:00] Elena's House | I saw just what I said. I heard, \"Before I leave San Gregorio Armeno for Mergellina, I should go see Professor Galiani and say hello. Would you come with me then?\"\n[1968-04-08 23:48:30] Elena's House | I saw, I added. I heard, \"After Ischia, our relationship cooled down. She thought that Nino leaving Nadia was all my fault.\"\n[1968-04-08 23:49:00] Elena's House | I saw Lina looking at me as if she didn't know me, and I continued speaking. I heard, \"The people from the Galiani family are all right, but they tend to jump to conclusions. The issue about the heart murmur needs to be verified again.\"\n[1968-04-08 23:49:30] Elena's House | I saw her respond then, saying, \"There are static noises.\" I answered. I heard, \"Well, but Nadia also said you should go see a specialist for heart problems.\"\n[1968-04-08 23:50:00] Elena's House | I saw her answer. I heard, \"No matter what, he heard the static.\"\n[1968-04-09 00:10:00] Elena's House | I saw her talking about what had happened in the drying room. I thought about it, but when it came to talking about sex, I especially wanted to say something about my own experience.",

    "text": "[1968-04-09 00:11:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I thought of saying, at Turin, something similar had also happened to me—a senior intellectual had rushed straight at me.\n[1968-04-09 00:12:00] Elena's House | I thought about the one in Porto, a Venezuelan painter, someone I only knew for a few hours, and he came to my room and tried to get into my bed as if it were something I should have done.\n[1968-04-09 00:13:00] Elena's House | I saw, but in this situation, I held back. What's the point in talking about these things at a time like this? But if I do speak, would it really be the same thing as what she said?\n[1968-04-09 00:15:00] Elena's House | I saw her speaking about these things that had happened to her. The last question clearly surfaced in my mind, just like it had several years ago when she told me about the terrible things that happened on her wedding night.\n[1968-04-09 00:16:00] Elena's House | I saw Lina talking vaguely about her sex life. I thought about bringing up such a topic, which was something completely new for us.\n[1968-04-09 00:17:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I know the environment in which we grew up, where everyone spoke without restraint, but those inappropriate words were always used to attack others or protect ourselves. I thought about the language of sex as a violent language, making those secret words hard to say out loud.\n[1968-04-09 00:20:00] Elena's House | I felt embarrassed, so I looked at the floor. When she spoke in that naked language, like Mergellina, about how sleeping with a man wasn't as enjoyable as she'd thought when she was a child, she said she almost never felt anything.\n[1968-04-09 00:21:00] Elena's House | I saw her, and after going through Stefano and Nino, she found it a very painful thing. Honestly, she just couldn't accept a gentleman like Enzo into her body.\n[1968-04-09 00:22:00] Elena's House | I saw that it was not just that; she also used a more disgusting and explicit way to talk about the experiences she had had so far.\n[1968-04-09 00:23:00] Elena's House | I know that sometimes it was forced, sometimes out of curiosity, or passion, but all the things men longed to do with women never gave her any pleasure, not even when she was with Nino, whom she longed for.\n[1968-04-09 00:24:00] Elena's House | I knew that even in the case of strong love, when she wanted to have a child for him, and later [childbearing statusattitude], she didn't feel any pleasure.\n[1968-04-09 00:25:00] Elena's House | I thought about her honesty, and I couldn't keep silent any longer. In order for her to feel my sincerity, I should also tell her something secret.\n[1968-04-09 00:26:00] Elena's House | I think about myself, and the dialect really annoys me. But if I have to speak Italian, I feel these vulgar things are a disgrace to the refined language I've learned, even though others think I'm the woman who wrote the provocative chapters.\n[1968-04-09 00:27:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw every word she spoke, including those vulgar and crude expressions, all tightly connected to the look of breakdown on her face and her trembling hands. I thought about how I was increasingly feeling embarrassed, I had forgotten that this confession was also difficult for her.\n[1968-04-09 00:28:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw and said briefly. I heard, \"For me, it's not like that.\"\n[1968-04-09 00:29:00] Elena's House | I thought I wasn't lying, but what I said wasn't the truth either. To speak the real feelings would be complicated, and I needed very careful words.\n[1968-04-09 00:30:00] Elena's House | I thought about how I needed to explain to her that during the time I was with Antonio, the moments we spent by the pond, our whispering against each other's ears, the way he touched me—these had always brought me pleasure and made me long for that sensation.\n[1968-04-09 00:31:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I thought about it, but I have to admit, the feeling of being entered also disappointed me. The experience was ruined by a sense of guilt. The environment at the time was uncomfortable, and I was worried about getting caught. We were rushing, and I was scared too [about the state of pregnancy].\n[1968-04-09 00:32:00] Elena's House | I thought I also had to mention Franco Mari, whose was the first experience I had with sexuality.\n[1968-04-09 00:33:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I thought about before and after he entered me, how he would have me rub against his legs and stomach, which was a very pleasant thing, and sometimes, it made the act itself beautiful.\n[1968-04-09 00:34:00] Elena's House | I thought about the outcome, and I had to tell her the final conclusion: Now, what awaits me is marriage. Pietro is a very gentlemanly man, and I hope that in the quiet, legal relationship of marriage, I will be able to calmly enjoy the pleasure of sex.\n[1968-04-09 00:35:00] Elena's House | I know, but this kind of careful, deliberate exchange was something neither of us, two women nearly twenty-five, had ever experienced before. I thought that if I could say it like that, it would be honest.\n[1968-04-09 00:36:00] Elena's House | I saw that, and I also vaguely mentioned the things between me and Antonio during her engagement to Stefano, speaking in a restrained and subtle manner.\n[1968-04-09 00:37:00] Elena's House | I didn't mention Donato Nino or Franco Mari at all, so I just said those few words. I heard, \"For me, it's not like that.\"\n[1968-04-09 00:37:30] Elena's House | I saw it clearly, she looked at me with an uneasy gaze, as if to defend herself, she said. I heard, \"But what you wrote in the book was something else.\" I thought those words would sound to her like: Maybe you're not quite normal.\n[1968-04-09 00:38:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I muttered something to myself. I heard, \"I don't know what's written in the book anymore.\" I thought she had read the book I wrote.\n[1968-04-09 00:38:30] Elena's House | I saw her say. I heard, \"It writes about some dirty things—things men don't want to hear, things women know but are too afraid to say. What are you doing now? You don't want to admit it, you want to hide yourself?\"\n[1968-04-09 00:39:00] Elena's House | I know she really did say it, \"dirty things.\" I thought even the passage she mentioned about the book's indecent scenes used the word \"dirty,\" just like Giggia had.\n[1968-04-09 00:40:00] Elena's House | I saw her mention the book, which was just an opening to illustrate how tedious it was to sleep with a man, a point she reiterated several times. I thought I hoped she would evaluate the book as a whole, but she didn't say anything.\n[1968-04-09 00:41:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw her sigh and say. I heard her say, \"What you wrote in your novel—if you've told it, that proves you understand. And yet you're saying, 'It's not like that for me.' Saying that doesn't mean anything.\"\n[1968-04-09 00:41:30] Elena's House | I saw my stammering. \"I heard, 'Yes, it might be true, I don't know.'\"\n[1968-04-09 00:42:00] Elena's House | At that moment, she spoke to me in a painful tone, unreservedly sharing her experience. I was very excited, but also deeply unsatisfied, with a feeling of nausea.\n[1968-04-09 00:45:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I thought about Nino, about the question that often occupied my mind: was this an appropriate moment, during that long, talkative night, to tell her that I had seen Nino?\n[1968-04-09 00:46:00] Elena's House | I thought about whether I should tell her that Gennaro couldn't rely on him, that Nino had another son and wouldn't care about his own child at all.\n[1968-04-09 00:47:00] Elena's House | I thought to myself whether I should take this opportunity, this moment of her confession, to let her know that in Porto, Nino said something bad about her: Lina was also bad in bed.\n[1968-04-09 00:48:00] Elena's House | I thought about how she had passionately explained her interpretation of the dirty parts in my book. Should I then conclude, fundamentally, that Nino was right? That is, what she wanted to point out was something that Nino's son had already discovered.\n[1968-04-09 00:49:00] Elena's House | I thought he also felt it, for Lina, being entered was only out of duty; she couldn't enjoy the pleasure of union.\n[1968-04-09 00:50:00] Elena's House | I thought, Nino was an expert, he had known many women, he knew what it was like for a woman to perform well sexually, and he could also tell when a woman performed poorly.\n[1968-04-09 00:51:00] Elena's House | I thought it was obvious that it was terrible in terms of sex, which meant not feeling pleasure when a man attacked me, meant rubbing against him to satisfy my own desire, meant grabbing his hand and pulling it toward my lower body, just like with Franco Mari, ignoring his annoyance, and after the climax, the exhaustion— he just wanted to lie still.\n[1968-04-09 00:52:00] Elena's House | I thought about how this unease was growing, I thought, I had written about these things in my novel, and both Giggia and Lina had found resonance in it. Perhaps Nino had noticed this too, which is why he wanted to talk to me about it?\n[1968-04-09 00:53:00] Elena's House | I saw myself swallowing all those words, saying only a vague statement. I heard, \"I feel very sorry.\"\n[1968-04-09 00:53:30] Elena's House | \"I heard 'What?' 'You've gone into [childbearing state] without any pleasure.'\"\n[1968-04-09 00:54:00] Elena's House | I saw her suddenly say in a sarcastic tone. I heard, \"I wouldn't feel sorry at all.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:00:00] Elena's House | I saw that she had just finished talking about her conflict with Michele, and I interrupted her. I saw it to the end, when the sky was about to brighten.\n[1968-04-09 05:01:00] Elena's House | I saw her say it. I heard, \"Stop talking, you need to stay calm, take your temperature.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:05:00] Elena's House | I know the result, her temperature was 38.5 degrees Celsius.\n[1968-04-09 05:06:00] Elena's House | I saw myself holding her tightly, whispering in her ear. \"I heard, 'Now I'll take care of you until you get better. I'll be with you all the time. If I have to go to Mergellina, you and the kids will come with me.'\"\n[1968-04-09 05:07:00] Elena's House | I saw her resolutely refuse me, saying one last thing: she said she shouldn't have come to Stazione Centrale with Enzo, and she wanted to go back to Mergellina.\n[1968-04-09 05:07:30] Elena's House | I heard, \"Back to our Mergellina?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you crazy?\" \"Once I feel better, I'll move back.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:08:00] Elena's House | I said that she was talking like this because she had a fever, that the days with Mergellina would be even worse, and that going back was simply too foolish.\n[1968-04-09 05:08:10] Elena's House | I saw and I said loudly. I heard, \"I can't wait to leave.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:09:00] Elena's House | I heard, \"You're strong, I've never been that strong. The farther you go, the more at ease you'll feel.\" I was surprised by the way she said it.\n[1968-04-09 05:09:30] Elena's House | \"I heard myself say, 'And me, just walking through that Mercato on the main road, I feel scared. Do you remember, once we wanted to go see the sea, but then it rained? Which one of us wanted to keep going forward, which one wanted to go back? Me or you?'\"",

I heard, \"You'd better go. Tell those two people, they've been waiting for several hours. They didn't sleep all night and now they have to go to work again.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:31:30] Elena's House | I heard, \"What should I say to them?\" \"Say whatever you want.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:40:00] Elena's House | I saw myself covering her blanket, and also covering Gennaro's blanket. I knew all night long, he slept very uneasily.\n[1968-04-09 05:41:00] Elena's House | I saw and I whispered. I heard, \"I'll be back soon.\" I thought I felt that Lina had calmed down.\n[1968-04-09 05:41:30] Elena's House | I saw her say. \"I heard, 'You must remember your promise to me.' 'What promise?'\"\n[1968-04-09 05:42:00] Elena's House | \"I heard, 'Have you already forgotten? If something happens to me, you have to take care of Gennaro.'\" \"You won't have anything happen to you.\"\n[1968-04-09 05:43:00] Elena's House | I saw Lina mutter something as I left the room, half-awake. \"I heard, 'You must watch me as I sleep, you must always watch me. Even when you leave San Gregorio Armeno, don't forget me. I know you're watching me, and that will make me feel safe.'\"\n[1968-04-10 09:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I knew that from the night I went to see Lina until the day I got married—I married on May 17, 1969, in Mergellina.\n[1968-04-10 09:01:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself enthusiastically beginning my new marriage, and I had always done my best to help Lina. I know we spent three days on our honeymoon in Venice.\n[1968-04-10 09:02:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that, actually, at first I just wanted to take care of her, until her cold got better.\n[1968-04-10 09:03:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I knew that during this phase, I had to clean up the house of Mergellina and deal with many other things related to the book promotion.\n[1968-04-10 09:04:00] Parents' home | I saw my mother muttering to herself. She had given the phone number to half of Mergellina, but no one called her. She said having this thing at home was a burden, and almost all the calls were for me. I saw the phone keep ringing.\n[1968-04-10 09:05:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself taking notes for a novel I might write in the future, and I also tried to make up for my lack of knowledge in literature and politics.\n[1968-04-10 09:06:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I was spending more and more time taking care of her. I thought of my friend's weak and helpless condition, which forced me to set aside my current tasks.\n[1968-04-10 09:10:00] At My Parents' House | I saw my mother immediately realize that my relationship with Lina had been restored. She was standing by, fanning the flames, not only scolding me but also speaking ill of Lina. I thought it was a shameful thing for her.\n[1968-04-10 09:11:00] Parents' home | I saw her limping behind me, criticizing me. I thought, even now, she still believed she could boss me around, telling me what I could do and what I couldn't. Sometimes, I felt as if she were trying to crawl into my mind, just to make sure I didn't take control of my own life.\n[1968-04-10 09:12:00] At My Parents' House | I saw her provoke me to speak. I heard, \"What do you and her have in common? What else is there to say? Think about your current position and her current state. Isn't writing that disgusting book enough? Do you really need to keep in touch with that whore?\"\n[1968-04-10 10:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw it, but I pretended not to hear and didn't say anything. I almost met Lina every day.\n[1968-04-10 23:00:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw her sleeping in the room, then I went out to face the two men who had been waiting in the kitchen all night, and I tried to help her rebuild her life.\n[1968-04-10 23:05:00] Elena's House | I told Enzo and Pasquale that Lina was sick and couldn't continue working at the factory in Soccavo; she had already quit her job.\n[1968-04-10 23:10:00] Elena's House | I thought there was no need to waste words with Enzo; he had understood a long time ago that Lina could no longer stand working in the factory, because her situation was very difficult and her inner self was breaking down.\n[1968-04-10T10:00:00] Home | I saw those days, and my mother hurriedly bought a photo album and began collecting articles about me in the newspaper.\n[1968-04-10T10:05:00] Home | I remember one morning, she asked me. I heard, \"What's your boyfriend's name?\"\n[1968-04-10T10:10:00] Home | I thought she knew my boyfriend's name, but she must have something to say to me, so she had to start from here.\n[1968-04-10T10:15:00] Home | I heard \"Pietro, Pietro.\" \"So, you'll also take the name Pietro in the future.\"\n[1968-04-10T10:20:00] Home | I heard, \"Yes.\" \"If you write another book in the future, will the cover say Pietro?\"\n[1968-04-10T10:25:00] Home | I heard \"No.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I like the name Elena Greco.\"\n[1968-04-10T10:30:00] At home | I heard her say, \"I like it too.\"\n[1968-04-11 06:00:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw Pasquale, on his way back to Mergellina in his car — it was very early, and the road was almost empty — he couldn't help but say. I heard, \"Let's not be too exaggerated.\"\n[1968-04-11 06:01:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw him say that, in the factory, Lina was indeed suffering, but everyone exploited in the world lived that way.\n[1968-04-11 06:02:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw him speaking to me in the same tone he'd used since childhood, talking about the peasants of southern Italy, the workers of the north, Latin America, northeastern Brazil, Africa, African Americans, the people of Vietnam, and American imperialism.\n[1968-04-11 06:03:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw that I quickly interrupted him and said. I heard, \"Pasquale, if Lina keeps going on like this, she'll die.\"\n[1968-04-11 06:04:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw it, but he still didn't stop. He kept opposing my point of view. I realized it wasn't because he didn't care about Lina, but because fighting in the factory in Soccavo was very important to him.\n[1968-04-11 06:05:00] In Pasquale's car | I thought about how he considered Lina's identity very important, and deep in his heart, he was convinced that Lina was just suffering from a cold, something that didn't warrant all this fuss. People like me, bourgeois intellectuals, would worry about a simple fever, but never about the political consequences of a failed workers' movement.\n[1968-04-11 06:06:00] In Pasquale's car | I realized I had said it myself, clearly and unmistakably—I just wanted to tell him that I understood his meaning. I thought about those words he never said outright, but instead spoke in a vague way.\n[1968-04-11 06:10:00] In Pasquale's car | I saw that, which made him even more annoyed. He set me down by the gate and said to me. I heard, \"Now I have to go to work, Elena, we'll talk about this later.\"\n[1968-04-12 10:00:00] Elena's House | I remember that later, whenever I went to Stazione Centrale, I would pull Enzo aside and tell him: If you really care about Lina, keep Pasquale away from her. She can't hear anything about the factory anymore.\n[1968-04-12 14:00:00] Elena's House | I see myself reading on the bus, or when Lina calms down. I knew that at that stage, I always carried a book in my bag along with my notebook.\n[1968-04-12 15:00:00] Elena's House | I sometimes found that she stared at me with wide eyes. I thought maybe she wanted to know what book I was reading, but she never even asked for the title.\n[1968-04-12 15:10:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I tried reading her a few pages from the book I was reading—I remember, it was a scene from the Epton Inn—and she closed her eyes, looking bored.",

I knew that a few days later, her fever broke, but the cough never completely went away.\n[1968-04-15 11:00:00] Elena's House | I saw that I was responsible for cleaning the house, cooking, and taking care of Gennaro.\n[1968-04-15 12:00:00] Elena's House | I thought maybe because he was already a big kid, he was a bit domineering and mischievous. I didn't find him as attractive as Milko—the other child of Nino.\n[1968-04-15 14:00:00] Elena's House | Sometimes he would go wild, then suddenly become very depressed, lying on the floor and falling into a deep sleep. He himself noticed it, and then clung to me more and more, not letting me work or read. I thought about it, and it made me soft-hearted, made me fall for him.\n[1968-04-15 16:00:00] Elena's House | I saw it, I lent her the money, she accepted it, and then she swore a thousand times that she would definitely pay me back. At this point, I wanted to learn more about Lina's situation: was she rich?\n[1968-04-15 16:05:00] Elena's House | I wondered how much Bruno owed her in wages? Two months' salary. What about her severance pay? She didn't know.\n[1968-04-15 16:10:00] Elena's House | I knew what Enzo was doing for a living and how much he earned? No. How much concrete benefit would the correspondence course in Zurich bring? I didn't know.\n[1968-04-15 16:15:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw her coughing constantly, her chest hurt, her throat was blocked, and her heartbeat sometimes went out of control.\n[1968-04-15 16:20:00] Elena's House | I saw that I had carefully recorded all the symptoms. I thought about trying to convince her to see a doctor and undergo a more thorough examination than the one Alman had done.\n[1968-04-15 16:30:00] Elena's House | I saw that she didn't agree, nor did she object to me.\n[1968-04-15T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw, but she never looked at my book, nor did my father, nor my younger brothers and sisters—Peppe, Gianni, and Elisa. I knew that at first, no one in Mergellina paid attention to the book I had written.\n[1968-04-16 20:00:00] Elena's House | I saw that one night, Enzo hadn't returned yet, and Pasquale showed up. He was very polite, saying that the committee members, as well as a few workers from Via Caracciolo, wanted to know how she was.\n[1968-04-16 20:10:00] Elena's House | I said again that her condition was still serious and that she needed rest, but he still wanted to see Lina, just to say hello.\n[1968-04-16 20:15:00] Elena's House | I saw myself making him wait in the kitchen, and I went to talk to Lina about it. I advised her not to meet Pasquale.\n[1968-04-16 20:20:00] Elena's House | I saw her make a face that meant: Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.\n[1968-04-16 20:25:00] Elena's House | I knew she had always been someone who never hesitated, who did exactly what she said, and who would go back on her word. I was moved by the fact that she now depended on me.\n[1968-04-17 21:00:00] Parent's home | That night, I made a long phone call to Pietro from my parents' house.\n[1968-04-17 21:05:00] Parents' home | I saw myself carefully explaining to him what had happened to Lina, and I said I really wanted to help her.\n[1968-04-17 21:10:00] Parent's home | I saw him on the other end of the phone, listening patiently as I spoke, and later he even showed a cooperative attitude.\n[1968-04-17 21:15:00] Parent's home | I knew he was thinking of a young scholar who studied Greek culture, a man who was very enthusiastic about IBM System and wanted to launch a revolution in philology through it.\n[1968-04-17 21:16:00] At My Parents' House | I thought about it and it moved me, because Pietro was always so absorbed in his own things, but at that moment, out of love for me, he wanted to do something useful for me.\n[1968-04-17 21:17:00] Parent's home | I saw myself begging him. I heard, \"You should get in touch with him, tell him about Enzo. It might help, maybe a job opportunity related to IBM System will come up.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:18:00] Parents' home | I saw him promise me that he would do it, and finally he added that he remembered, Mariarosa had a brief relationship with a young lawyer from San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1968-04-17 21:19:00] Parent's house | I saw that he might be able to get in touch with the lawyer and ask if he could help me. I heard, \"What do you want?\" \"Get the money back for your friend.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:20:00] Parents' home | \"I called Mariarosa.\" \"Okay.\" I thought to myself that I was suddenly filled with passion.\n[1968-04-17 21:21:00] Parent's home | I saw myself saying it again. I heard, \"Don't just agree with me on the surface, you really have to call me, please!\"\n[1968-04-17 21:22:00] Parents' home | I saw him hesitate for a moment, then speak. I heard myself say, \"Your tone of voice is exactly like my mother's.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:23:00] Parents' home | \"I heard 'What do you mean?' 'That's the tone she uses when she really cares about something.' 'Unfortunately, we're just too different.'\"\n[1968-04-17 21:24:00] At My Parents' House | I saw him fall silent for a moment and then say. I heard, \"Thank goodness you're not like her. In this regard, no one can compare to her. You should tell her about this girl, and she'll find a way to help you.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:30:00] Parents' home | I called Adele Airota. I thought I felt a bit embarrassed, but then I remembered what she had done for my book, and for the house of Mergellina, and I forgot my embarrassment.\n[1968-04-17 21:31:00] Parent's home | I know she is a woman who can solve problems.\n[1968-04-17 21:32:00] Parent's home | I know that if she needed something, she would pick up the phone, one call leading to another, and she always managed to get what she wanted; she always made it impossible for someone to refuse her request.\n[1968-04-17 21:33:00] Parents' home | I know she can effortlessly move between different ways of thinking, and she doesn't respect established social hierarchies.\n[1968-04-17 21:34:00] Parent's home | I knew she treated all the cleaning women, office workers, entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and ministers the same way, speaking to them with a polite and distant tone, as if it wasn't she asking for help, but rather they who were seeking hers.\n[1968-04-17 21:35:00] Parent's home | I called Adele Airota, first apologizing for the interruption, and then carefully told her about my friend's situation. I thought it would spark her curiosity and also make her angry.\n[1968-04-17 21:40:00] Parents' home | I saw her finally say to me. \"I'm thinking.\" \"Okay.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:41:00] Parents' home | \"I can give you some advice?\" \"Of course.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:42:00] At My Parents' House | I heard, \"Don't be shy. You're a writer; you should use your identity to do something, to make people feel your weight.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:43:00] Parent's home | I heard, \"This is a decisive period, everything is being destroyed and rebuilt. You must join in, you must take action. Start with these people, make it so they have no way out.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:44:00] Parent's home | I heard, \"What should I do?\" \"You have to write about these things, scare Soccavo and people like him. You must write, can you promise me?\" \"I'll try.\"\n[1968-04-17 21:45:00] Parent's home | I saw her give me a name—the editor-in-chief of L'Unità.\n[1968-04-17 22:00:00] Parent's home | I thought about my call with Pietro, especially the one with my mother-in-law, which allowed me to release a feeling I had been holding in for a long time.\n[1968-04-17 22:01:00] Parents' home | I thought that up until then, I had been suppressing myself, but now this emotion suddenly burst forth, and it had to do with the change in my identity.\n[1968-04-17 22:02:00] At My Parents' House | I thought of the Pietro family, especially Guido Airota, and perhaps even Adele Airota herself, who probably considered me a good girl, but I was nothing like the daughter-in-law they had expected.\n[1968-04-17 22:03:00] Parent's home | I thought the same thing—probably my background, my San Gregorio Armeno accent, and my clumsy way of doing things were a challenge for them.\n[1968-04-17 22:04:00] Parent's home | The more daring idea I came up with was that the publication of my book was also an emergency plan, one that would allow me...\n[1968-04-17 22:05:00] Parent's home | I thought, but one thing was undeniable: they accepted me, and under their approval, I was going to marry Pietro.",

I could walk forward boldly without fear, or if I encountered danger, I could hide within the castle.\n[1968-04-17 22:07:00] Parent's home | I thought about how urgently I needed to adapt to my new identity, especially how I should have a sense of that identity.\n[1968-04-17 22:08:00] Parent's home | I realized that I was no longer a little girl who had only one match left. Now I had a large stock of matches, and so I suddenly understood that I could do a lot for Lina, more than I had ever imagined.\n[1968-04-18 10:00:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw that she had this awareness, so I asked her to give me all the files she'd collected against Soccavo. She passively handed them over without asking me what I was going to do with them.\n[1968-04-18 10:30:00] Parents' home | I was so absorbed in watching that I didn't realize it. I thought about how accurately and sharply she spoke about those terrible things.\n[1968-04-18 10:31:00] Parents' home | I thought about how her description of the factory contained so many unbearable experiences.\n[1968-04-18 11:00:00] Parents' house | I held the pages in my hand and read them over and over again. Suddenly, almost without making a conscious decision, I found Sokolov's phone number in the telephone directory and called him directly.\n[1968-04-18 11:01:00] My parents' house | I adjusted my voice and said in a tone that carried just the right amount of arrogance. I heard, \"Hello, this is Elena Greco, please put Bruno on the phone.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:02:00] Parents' home | I saw it, and my attitude was cold. I heard him greet me warmly: \"I was so happy to get your call!\"\n[1968-04-18 11:03:00] Parents' home | I saw him say it. \"I heard you did such amazing things, Elena. I saw a photo of you on Il Messaggero, it's great! The time we spent together at Vomero was so beautiful.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:04:00] Parents' home | I said I was also happy to call him, it was something that had happened a long time ago on Ischia, and regardless of whether it was good or bad, all of us had changed.\n[1968-04-18 11:05:00] Parents' home | I saw, for example, that about him, I'd heard a lot of bad rumors, and I hoped they weren't true.\n[1968-04-18 11:06:00] At My Parents' House | I saw him and immediately understood what I was going to say, so he started talking a lot about Lina, calling her ungrateful and saying she had caused him trouble.\n[1968-04-18 11:07:00] Parents' home | I saw that I had changed my tone, and I said, I believe Lina more than what he says.\n[1968-04-18 11:08:00] Parent's home | I said it, and I saw it. I heard, \"You pick up your pen and paper, write down my phone number, okay? You give her every single penny you're supposed to give her. Get the money ready, then call me, and I'll come get it.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:08:30] At My Parents' House | I heard, \"I don't want your photo to appear in the newspaper either.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:09:00] Parents' home | I hung up before he could object. I thought about how proud I was of myself.\n[1968-04-18 11:10:00] Parents' home | I saw that I didn't show even the slightest emotion. I was straightforward, speaking a few concise words in Italian, first very polite, then cold.\n[1968-04-18 11:11:00] Parents' home | I thought that maybe Pietro was right: my tone was becoming more and more like Adele Airota's, without my even realizing it, I was imitating the way she conducted herself.\n[1968-04-18 11:12:00] Parent's home | I thought about it, deciding to figure out whether I could go on as I had said I would.\n[1968-04-18 11:30:00] At My Parents' House | I wasn't really excited when I called Bruno to threaten him, because he'd always been that boring guy who tried to get close to me on the Città beach. But when I called the editor at L'Unità, I was extremely nervous.\n[1968-04-18 11:31:00] Parents' home | I thought about when the phone was answered, and I hoped the person on the other end wouldn't hear my mother shouting in the dialect at Elena.\n[1968-04-18 11:32:00] At My Parents' House | I said to the operator that I was Elena Greco.\n[1968-04-18 11:33:00] Parent's home | I hadn't yet told her who I was looking for when the woman suddenly asked loudly; she had read my book andenthusiastically complimented me. \n\nI hadn't yet told her who I was looking for when the woman suddenly asked loudly; she had read my book and enthusiastically praised me. I heard, \"Is that the female writer Elena Greco?\"\n[1968-04-18 11:34:00] Parent's home | I saw my gratitude toward her. I felt happy and strong.\n[1968-04-18 11:35:00] Parent's home | I told her I wanted to write an article about a small factory in the suburbs of San Gregorio Armeno, and I mentioned the name of the editor Adele Airota had recommended to me.\n[1968-04-18 11:36:00] Parent's home | I saw the operator flatter me again, speaking to me in the formal tone of her job. I heard, \"Please wait a moment.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:37:00] Parent's home | I had barely seen it for a minute when a rough male voice, speaking in a joking tone, asked me. I heard the question: \"Since when have those who write literature been willing to waste their pen on these workers' piecework, shift schedules, and overtime?\"\n[1968-04-18 11:38:00] At My Parents' House | I heard her say, \"These things are all boring, especially successful female writers, they try to stay as far away from them as possible.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:38:30] Parent's home | I heard \"What field?\" he asked me, \"architecture, ports, or mines?\"\n[1968-04-18 11:39:00] Parents' home | I saw, I said quietly. I heard, \"It's a sausage factory, not very big.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:39:30] At my parents' house | I saw the man still speaking in a joking tone. I heard, \"That's good, you don't need to explain.\"\n[1968-04-18 11:40:00] Parent's home | \"I heard them say, 'This newspaper once devoted half a page to loudly praising you, Ms. Elena Greco. If you decide to write about sausages, what can we, poor editors, say but that we're not interested?'\"\n[1968-04-18 11:41:00] Parent's home | I heard, \"Is thirty lines enough? Too few? Then let's add a bit more, sixty lines. When you're done, how do we proceed? Will you bring it to me yourself, or will you dictate it to me?\"\n[1968-04-18 12:00:00] At my parents' house | I saw myself immediately starting to write the article, I wanted to condense the few pages Lina had written into a sixty-line essay. I thought that out of love for her, I should write better.\n[1968-04-18 12:30:00] At my parents' house | I know, but I have no experience writing reports. Except for when I was fifteen, I tried to write an article about my conflict with the religious teacher for Nino's newspaper, but it turned out badly.\n[1968-04-18 12:35:00] At My Parents' House | I thought about it, but I didn't know why—maybe because the memory of that incident had made things complicated, or perhaps because the editor's sarcastic tone still echoed in my ears, especially at the end of the call, when he told me to send my mother-in-law his regards.\n[1968-04-18 14:00:00] At My Parents' House | I saw that I had spent a long time writing that article, revising it again and again, very carefully.\n[1968-04-18 15:00:00] At my parents' house | I realized I hadn't sent the article to the newspaper, and I needed to discuss it with Lina first. I thought about it, but even after I finished writing, I still felt unsatisfied.\n[1968-04-18 15:05:00] Parents' home | I thought to myself, this is something we need to decide together. I'll go back tomorrow to submit the manuscript.\n[1968-04-19 10:00:00] Elena's house | I saw the next day, and I went to find Lina. I thought her condition was especially bad.\n[1968-04-19 10:05:00] Elena's House | I saw her mutter that, while I was away, some things had crept in and were tormenting her and Gennaro.\n[1968-04-19 10:10:00] Elena's House | I saw that she noticed I was worried, so I made a joking face and said those were all lies, that she just wanted me to stay with her a little longer.",

I realized I had become optimistic, which prompted me to make a decision.\n[1968-04-19 20:05:00] Parent's home | I knew she had already talked about it with her husband and Mariarosa.\n[1968-04-19 20:10:00] At my parents' house | I know that within just a few hours, they mobilized all their connections: big names in the medical field, Professor Socialist Party who was familiar with the union, and a member of the Christian Democratic Party. She said the man was a bit dumb, but a good person, an expert on workers' rights.\n[1968-04-19 20:15:00] At my parents' house | I knew the result the next day. She arranged for me to see the best cardiologist in San Gregorio Armeno—a friend of a friend. I didn't have to pay anything, and the examiner would come quickly to the factory in Soccavo for the checkup.\n[1968-04-19 20:20:00] At My Parents' House | I knew that to get back the money I owed Lina, I could go to Mariarosa's lawyer friend, the one Pietro had mentioned to me, a young Socialist Party lawyer who had an office on the Niccolò Amaldi Square, and she had already made an appointment.\n[1968-04-19 20:25:00] Parent's home | I heard, \"Are you happy?\" \"I'm very happy.\"\n[1968-04-19 20:25:30] Parent's home | I heard, \"Did you finish the article?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"I thought you wouldn't write it.\"\n[1968-04-19 20:26:00] At my parents' house | I heard, \"Actually, I've already written it, I'll send it to L'Unità tomorrow.\"\n[1968-04-19 20:26:30] At my parents' house | \"I heard, 'Good. I almost underestimated you.' 'Almost?' 'It was an underestimate. How are you and my son—the poor little guy?\"\n[1968-04-20 09:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself asking Mrs. Manuela for the address, saying goodbye to her, and then crossing the city.\n[1968-04-20 10:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I first took the subway to Mergellina Station, then walked a bit, and finally boarded a bus to Posillipo.\n[1968-04-20 10:10:00] Posillipo | I thought that I considered myself culturally refined, belonging to the powerful class, as if wearing a crown, revered by the whole world. I was very curious.\n[1968-04-20 10:11:00] Posillipo | I thought about wanting to see what that evil force I'd seen since childhood had become—those vulgar pleasures of bullying others, the criminal acts that went unpunished, the hypocritical respect for the law—what kind of luxurious disguise they now wore.\n[1968-04-20 10:12:00] Posillipo\n\nPosillipo | I saw that Michele lived on the top floor of a building, a newly constructed one, but Michele once again avoided me. I know the Solara brothers were born to show off their wealth and love for display.\n[1968-04-20 10:15:00] Michele's House | I saw only Giacola, and when she saw me, she was clearly surprised, yet also hostile. I realized that during the period when I borrowed her mother's phone, I had always been polite to the entire family. But once I had a phone installed in my parents' home, the Spagnuolo family disappeared from my life, and I hadn't even realized it.\n[1968-04-20 10:16:00] Michele's house | I found myself in the Posillipo district, appearing without prior notice, suddenly bursting into her unprepared wedding room. I saw that it was noon, in a dim, rainy moment.\n[1968-04-20 10:17:00] Michele's House | I saw myself pretending to be happy, trying to make her forgive me. I thought, what kind of behavior is this? I felt very ashamed.\n[1968-04-20 10:20:00] Michele's House | I saw that at first, Geyao was slightly annoyed, maybe a bit wary, but then she started showing off. I thought she didn't know what I wanted to do, that she wanted me to be jealous of her, wanted me to think she was the luckiest girl among us.\n[1968-04-20 10:25:00] Michele's House | I watched her show me one room after another in the house, pointing out the expensive furniture, the luxurious chandeliers, two large bathrooms, an enormous water heater, and the fridge and washing machine. I thought about how she had been watching my reaction all along, and my enthusiasm delighted her.\n[1968-04-20 10:26:00] Michele's House | I saw they had three telephones, but they weren't working yet, and there was also a big television, the size of which I didn't know.\n[1968-04-20 10:30:00] Michele's House | I saw it all, and we ended up on a balcony, but it wasn't a balcony at all—it was an aerial garden. I saw all kinds of flowers growing on top, but the weather was bad, so I couldn't fully appreciate the vibrant colors of the flowers.\n[1968-04-20 10:31:00] Michele's House | I heard, \"You see, have you ever seen such a sea? Such a San Gregorio Armeno, and also Mount Vesuvius? Look at this sky? In ou rMergellina, you've never seen such a sky, have you?\" I saw the sky was leaden, the bay like a huge cauldron pressing against the horizon, dense clouds churning and surging toward us.\n[1968-04-20 10:32:00] Michele's House | I saw it, but on the horizon, between the sea and the dark clouds, there was a long, leaden-white, dazzling crack in the sky, set against the purple shadow of Mount Vesuvius.\n[1968-04-20 10:33:00] Michele's House | I saw that we had been enjoying the view from the balcony for a long time. I saw that the wind was strong, and my clothes clung tightly to my body.\n[1968-04-20 10:33:10] Michele's House | I thought about how completely I had been captivated by the beauty of San Gregorio Armeno, even several years ago, on the balcony at Teacher Galiani's house, I had never seen such a beautiful view.\n[1968-04-20 10:33:20] Michele's House | I know that Michele bought a commemorative house. I thought about how these concrete buildings were constructed in the beautiful scenic area, which was very unseemly, but their prices were extremely high.\n[1968-04-20 10:35:00] Michele's House | I heard, \"Don't you like it?\" \"It's fantastic!\" \"Lina's house in Mergellina can't even compare to this one, can it?\" \"No, it really can't.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:35:30] Michele's House | \"I said Lina, but now it's Pinocchia who lives there.\" \"Yes.\" \"It's much more spacious here.\" \"Yes.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:36:00] Michele's House | I heard, \"But you made that face.\" \"No, I'm happy for you.\" \"Everyone has their own path. You went to school, wrote books, but I have what I have now.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:36:30] Michele's House | I heard her say, \"If you look closely at the house numbers, everyone living here are engineers, lawyers, and big professors. These views and conveniences come at a price. If you and your husband are careful with your money, I think you could afford a house like this.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:37:00] Michele's house | I heard, \"I think we can't do it.\" \"Does he not want to come live in San Gregorio Armeno?\" \"I can rule out that possibility.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:37:30] Michele's House | I heard him say, \"Everything is possible, you're lucky. I've heard Pietro's voice on the phone many times, and I've even seen him from the window. You can tell he's a good man, and he'll do what you said, unlike Michele.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:40:00] Michele's house | I saw that, and she pulled me into the house, wanting me to eat something. She opened the paper package, which contained ham and sausages, and she cut the bread.",

I heard, \"The house isn't fully cleaned yet, but in the future, when you and your husband come to San Gregorio Armeno, you can come here, and I'll show you how the house looks when it's all tidy.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:42:00] Michele's House | I saw her very excited, her eyes wide and her gaze bright. I thought she was trying very hard to make me believe in her wealth and extravagance, but that unlikely future—me and Pietro coming to San Gregorio Armeno, visiting her and Michele—should have given her at least a little doubt.\n[1968-04-20 10:43:00] Michele's House | I saw that she was a bit distracted. I thought she might be thinking of some terrible things.\n[1968-04-20 10:44:00] Michele's House | When I saw her start showing off again, I lost confidence in what I was saying. Her tone changed, and she began to list things. I thought about it, but when she said that, she wasn't really satisfied, even carrying a hint of self-mockery.\n[1968-04-20 10:45:00] Michele's House | I heard her say, \"I'm so lucky, Pinocchio is with the girl at the gas station on the main road. Pinocchio was ruined by that fool Rino. Pinocchio became Stefano's mistress, but I have Michele. What a blessing he is. He's handsome and smart, everyone listens to him. He's finally decided to marry me.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:46:00] Michele's House | \"I heard him say, 'You saw where he had me live, didn't you? You know what kind of wedding he's preparing? We're having a grand wedding, even more lavish than the Shah of Persia's banquet when he married Soraya. Yes, and I've been with him since childhood—I have the best taste.'\"\n[1968-04-20 10:47:00] Michele's house | I saw her go on, first mocking herself by praising her own shrewdness, then gradually turning it into a confession—her loneliness as a newlywed. I know she said Michele was never there, as if she were getting married all by herself.\n[1968-04-20 10:48:00] Michele's House | I saw her suddenly ask me, as if she really needed a confirmation. I heard, \"Do you think I exist? Look at me, do you think I exist?\"\n[1968-04-20 10:48:30] Michele's House | I saw her slap her full chest with her open hand. I know Michele got everything from her, back when she was still almost a child. He drained her, tore her apart, and now that she's nearly twenty-five, he's grown accustomed to it, even to the point of no longer looking at her. I thought that by doing this, she was showing me that her body didn't exist in Michele's eyes.\n[1968-04-20 10:49:00] Michele's house | \"I heard him say, 'He's out there, he can sleep with whoever he wants, it really disgusts me. When someone asked how many kids he wanted, he just blurted out, 'Go ask Giggia, I already have so many, I don't even know how many.' Would your husband tell you things like that?\"\n[1968-04-20 10:49:30] Michele's House | \"I heard him treat me like a rag to wipe one's feet in front of everyone. I know why. He doesn't love me. He married me because he wanted a loyal servant. All men get married for that reason.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:50:00] Michele's House | I heard him say, \"What the hell do I need you for? You don't understand anything. You're so stupid and have no taste. Giving this beautiful house to you is a waste. Everything you get involved in turns into a mess.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:50:30] Michele's House | I saw her start to cry, sobbing as she spoke. I heard him say, \"I'm sorry, I said that because of what you wrote in that book. I really like that book, and I know you understand these kinds of pain.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:51:00] Michele's House | I heard, \"Why did you let him say those things to you?\" \"Because if I didn't, he wouldn't have married me.\" \"After the marriage, you'll make him pay for it.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:51:30] Michele's house | \"I heard, 'What can I do? He doesn't care about me at all. I never see him now, let alone ever again.' 'I don't understand that.'\"\n[1968-04-20 10:52:00] Michele's House | I heard, \"You don't understand because you're not me. Do you think you'd marry him if you knew a man loved another woman?\"\n[1968-04-20 10:52:30] Michele's House | I saw myself looking at her uneasily. I heard, \"Michele has a lover?\" \"He has many lovers. He's a man, and men always have lovers. But that's not the most important thing.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:53:00] Michele's House | I heard, \"What is the most important thing?\" \"Elena, I'm telling you, don't say anything about this to anyone, or Michele will kill me.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:53:30] Michele's House | I saw that I had promised her, and I kept my promise. I think about it now, and I'm writing this down because she is already dead.\n[1968-04-20 10:54:00] Michele's House | I heard her say, \"He loved Lina, he's never loved me like that, and he'll never love anyone that way.\" \"Nonsense.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:54:30] Michele's house | \"I heard 'You shouldn't say I'm just talking nonsense. Elena, if you don't believe me, you'd better leave. It's true. He fell in love with her the day Lina put the leather knife against Marcello's neck. Did I make that up myself? It's what he told me himself.\"\n[1968-04-20 10:55:00] Michele's house | I knew she had told me not long ago, that one night in that house, Michele had gotten drunk and confessed to her how many women he'd had, with an exact number: one hundred and twenty-two, some paid, some free. I felt deeply uneasy when I thought about the things she had told me.\n[1968-04-20 10:56:00] Michele's House | I know Michele emphasized that she was also among the one hundred and twenty-two women, but she didn't belong to those who gave him so much pleasure. She was an idiot, even needing intelligence during sex, and she couldn't even perform oral sex, lacking any talent for it, which disgusted him.\n[1968-04-20 10:57:00] Michele's House | I knew he had been saying things like that for a while now, and his words were getting more and more disgusting. Being with him, vulgarity was a basic principle.\n[1968-04-20 10:58:00] Michele's House | I know, then, that Michele wanted to explain things to her: he had married her out of respect for her father, and because of their long friendship. Her father was a very experienced pastry chef. He had married her because men always need a wife, children, and a respectable home.\n[1968-04-20 10:59:00] Michele's house | I know, but he doesn't want her to misunderstand. To him, Giggia meant nothing; marrying her wasn't like putting her on an altar. She wasn't the one he loved most, and she shouldn't think she had the right to control him or trouble his mind.\n[1968-04-20 11:00:00] Michele's House | I knew these were all harsh words, and later Michele himself realized it too; he became very sorrowful.\n[1968-04-20 11:01:00] Michele's House | I know he muttered that, for him, all women were silly, each having some holes to play with, all the same except one: Lina was the only woman in the world he'd ever loved—he loved Lina like a movie romance, he respected her.\n[1968-04-20 11:02:00] Michele's house | I saw Geyola weeping and saying. I heard him say that Lina must know how to have this house renovated well, that spending money on renovating this house was a pleasure for him. He told me that being with her, he could become a prominent figure in San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1968-04-20 11:02:30] Michele's House | I heard him say, \"Do you remember how she dealt with that wedding photo? Do you remember how she took care of that shop? What about you? Pinocchio, you've had other women, what are you two, what can you possibly come up with?\"\n[1968-04-20 11:03:00] Michele's House | I know he said these words to her, but it wasn't just that—he also said that he thought of Lina every day, night and day, but not in a normal way, his desire for her was not like the ones he was familiar with.\n[1968-04-20 11:04:00] Michele's House | I know that in reality, he didn't want her, meaning he didn't want her the way he would want an ordinary woman—to take her, to have sex with her, to turn her over and over, to open her up, to ruin her, to trample her, to humiliate her.",

    "text": "[1968-04-20 11:05:00] Michele's house | I know he isn't trying to get her and then forget her. He wants her thoughts, her creative ideas. He has to treat her carefully, not harm her, let her develop.\n[1968-04-20 11:06:00] Michele's House | I know he wants her, not to do that—using that verb with Lina unsettles him. He wants to be close to her, to touch her, to accept her touch, her help, her guidance, and her commands.\n[1968-04-20 11:07:00] Michele's house | I know he wants her, to watch her change year by year, to see her grow older bit by bit. He wants to talk to her, to think with her help.\n[1968-04-20 11:08:00] Michele's House | I heard her say, \"Do you understand? That's how he talked about Lina to me. I'm the one who's going to marry him, and he's never spoken to me like that before. I swear, that's the truth.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:09:00] Michele's house | I heard him mutter, \"My brother Marcello, and that bastard Stefano, that rotten Enzo—do they even know Lina? Have they realized what they've lost, and what they're going to lose? No, they don't have that wisdom.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:10:00] Michele's House | \"I heard him say, 'Only I know what she is, who she is. I can see it, and the thought that she's been wasted makes me suffer.' That's how he ranted, venting his anger. I just sat there listening, saying nothing. Later, he fell asleep.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:11:00] Michele's house | I heard myself thinking: \"Is Michele really this kind of man? He's capable of feeling this—this isn't him speaking, it's someone else, another man I hate. I thought: Now that he's asleep, I'll kill him with a knife, and I'll get my Michele back.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:12:00] Michele's house | \"I don't hate Lina at all. A few years ago, I wanted to kill her because Michele didn't let me work in the shoe store in the city, but made me go back behind the counter at Capodimonte. At that time, I felt completely worthless. But now I don't hate her anymore, and it has nothing to do with her. She's always wanted to get out of all this.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:13:00] Michele's house | I heard her say, \"She's not the kind of fool who would marry Michele. She'd never marry Michele. On the contrary, since Michele always gets what he wants, but he can't get her. He's been in love with Lina for a long time: at least there's one woman who makes him completely lose his composure.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:15:00] Michele's House | I saw myself there, listening and trying to comfort her, I said. \"I heard, 'If he married you, that would mean, no matter what he says, he still cares about you. Don't be too desperate.'\"\n[1968-04-20 11:16:00] Michele's House | I saw Geyao shake her head forcefully, wiping the tears from her cheeks with her fingers. She said, \"You don't understand him. No one knows him like I do.\" I asked. I heard, \"Do you think he might lose his mind and hurt Lina?\"\n[1968-04-20 11:17:00] Michele's house | I saw her reaction was quite intense; she let out a sigh that was somewhere between a dry laugh and a sob. I heard, \"Him? Hurt Lina? Haven't you seen how he's been doing it these past years? He can hurt me, you, anyone, even his father, his mother, and his brother.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:17:30] Michele's House | I heard, \"He might hurt everyone Lina cares about—her son, Enzo. He can act recklessly and coldly toward anyone, but when it comes to Lina herself, he can't do anything.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:30:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I was determined to complete my journey of exploration, so I continued walking until I reached the Meridiana Station, and finally I arrived at the Martiri Square. I saw that the dark clouds were very low, as if pressing down on the roof of the building.\n[1968-04-20 11:35:00] Martiri Square | I saw him heading toward the high-end shoe store of the Solara family. I thought to myself that I was certain the storm would break at any moment.\n[1968-04-20 11:40:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw Alfonso Carracci. He was even more handsome than I remembered, with big eyes, long lashes, delicate lips, a slender but strong body.\n[1968-04-20 11:41:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I knew that because he had studied Latin and Greek, his Italian was somewhat unnatural.\n[1968-04-20 11:42:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him seeing me, and he was genuinely happy. I thought about the tough years we spent together in junior and senior high school, how we built a strong friendship. Even though we hadn't seen each other for a long time, we immediately became familiar again, teasing each other as before.\n[1968-04-20 11:45:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw us talking freely, jumping from one topic to another, discussing things at school, the teachers, the book I had published, his wedding, and my wedding.\n[1968-04-20 11:50:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw that he was confused when I mentioned Lina to him. I thought he didn't want to say anything bad about Lina, nor about his brother or Pinocchia.\n[1968-04-20 11:51:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him and said nothing. I heard, \"Things have come to this, it was predictable.\" \"Why?\" \"Don't you remember, I told you that Lina scared me?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:52:00] Sorara Shoe Store | \"I heard, 'That wasn't fear, I understood much later.' 'What was it?' 'A strange attraction, a feeling that was both far and near.' 'So what does that mean?'\"\n[1968-04-20 11:53:00] Sorara Shoe Store | \"I heard her say, 'It's hard to explain: right away, I became your friend, and I really like you, but with her, it's impossible to establish such a friendly relationship. There's something terrifying about her that makes me want to kneel before her and tell her my innermost secrets.'\"\n[1968-04-20 11:54:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw myself jokingly saying. I heard, \"That's good, it's a religious experience.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:55:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw that he was still as serious as ever. I heard her say, \"No, it's a feeling of inferiority. During the time she helped me study, it was a great experience. She would look at the textbook and immediately understand it, then explain it to me in a simple way.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:56:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard her say, \"At the time, I often thought, and I still often think: If I had been born a girl, I would have wanted to be like her. In fact, in the family in Karachi, both of us were outsiders, neither of us could stay for long, so I never blamed her. I was always on her side.\"\n[1968-04-20 11:57:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard, \"Is Stefano still angry with her?\" \"I don't know. Even though he hated Lina, he has too much to deal with now, and Lina is the least of his problems.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:00:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw that I no longer talked about Lina, and I began to ask about his Pinocchio, and the Nino family, and finally about Nino. I thought that, for me, his conclusion was sincere and credible.\n[1968-04-20 12:01:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw his answer was very vague, especially regarding Nino; now no one dared to invite him to this unbearable wedding. I know he told me that it was Donato's wish.\n[1968-04-20 12:02:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I dared to ask a question. I heard, \"You don't want to get married?\"\n[1968-04-20 12:03:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him looking at the window display, he said. I heard, \"It's fine not to get married.\" I saw thunder and lightning outside, but it hadn't started to rain yet.\n[1968-04-20 12:03:30] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard, \"What about Pinocchio?\" \"She can't, she just can't.\" \"Do you want her to be your girlfriend for the rest of your life?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:04:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I looked at him with an expression of disbelief. I heard, \"So in the end you gave in to her request.\" \"She went to Michele.\" \"What did she want with him?\"\n[1968-04-20 12:05:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him smile, a somewhat nervous smile. I heard, \"She went to Michele, and they're teaming up against me.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:06:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw myself sitting on a low, sturdy sofa. I saw him standing with the light behind him, his body taut like a bullfighter in a movie.\n[1968-04-20 12:07:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard, \"I don't understand, did you marry Pinochetta because she told Solara that you should marry her?\" \"I married Pinochetta so as not to offend Michele. He placed me in this shop, he believes in my abilities, and I'm very grateful to him.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:08:00] Sorara Shoe Store | \"I'm crazy?\" \"You say that because you don't understand Michele, you don't know what kind of person he is.\" His face was twisted, struggling to hold back his tears, and finally he said. I heard, \"Pinochia [has given birth].\"\n[1968-04-20 12:09:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I felt very embarrassed, so I took his hand and tried to calm him down. I know the reason is this.\n[1968-04-20 12:10:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him struggling to calm down and said to me. I heard, \"Life is a very ugly thing, Elena.\" \"That's not true, Pinocchio will be a good wife and also a good mother.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:10:30] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard, \"What's with Pinocchio? It's none of my business.\" \"Don't be so dramatic.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:11:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him staring at me, and he asked. I heard, \"Didn't Lina say anything to you?\" I thought he was studying me, as if trying to figure out something I hadn't spoken aloud.\n[1968-04-20 12:12:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him shaking his head, and suddenly I felt very happy, and said. I heard, \"What should she have said to me?\" \"You see, I was right. She's not an ordinary person.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:13:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard her say, \"Once, I told her a secret. At the time, I was very scared and needed someone to talk to about why I was afraid. I told her, and she listened carefully to what I had to say. Later, I calmed down.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:14:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard her say, \"For me, it was very important to talk about this with her. I felt she wasn't listening with her ears, but with some organ only she had. That's when the words became bearable.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:15:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I heard myself say, \"In the end, I didn't tell her, as people usually do: 'You have to swear, please, you won't betray me.' But it's clear now that if she didn't tell you about this, then she told no one, not even in the hardest moments, those filled with hatred, when my brother hit her.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:16:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw that I hadn't interrupted him. The thing that makes me sad is that, even though I've always been his friend, he told Lina some secret things but never told me.\n[1968-04-20 12:17:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw that he had also sensed it, and he tried to make amends. He held me tightly, whispering in my ear. I heard, \"Elena, I'm a float, I don't like girls.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:18:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I saw him say, embarrassed, as I was about to leave. I heard, \"I thought you had already figured it out.\"\n[1968-04-20 12:19:00] Sorara Shoe Store | I thought about it, which made me even sadder, and in fact, I hadn't even considered it.",

    "text": "[1968-04-20 20:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that it wasn't raining, but the sky was very dark and overcast. I know it's like that, and I've spent a long day.\n[1968-04-20 20:01:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I realized that from that moment on, my attitude had changed. On the surface, my relationship with Lina grew closer and closer, but now I longed to cut the knot and get back to my own life.\n[1968-04-20 20:02:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought, or rather, this transformation had already begun, in those small details, when these details struck me, I could feel it, but now these details have accumulated.\n[1968-04-20 20:30:00] Parents' home | I thought going out for a walk was useful, but when I got back home, I became very unhappy.\n[1968-04-20 20:31:00] Parent's home | I thought about how, all these years, she never told me about Alfonso Carracci, even though she clearly knew how close I was to him.\n[1968-04-20 20:32:00] Parent's home | I wondered what our friendship with Lina really was. Was it possible that she hadn't noticed Michele's absolute dependence on her? Or had she, for her own reasons, decided not to tell me about it? On the other hand, how many things had I hidden from her?\n[1968-04-20 21:00:00] Parent's home | The rest of that day, my mind was in a mess, and those times, places, and the different people I had met kept coming back to me: Mrs. Manuela, ghost-like; Rino, with his vacant eyes; Girolama from elementary school, Girolama from middle school, and Girolama in her teenage years, drawn to the Solara brothers.\n[1968-04-20 21:05:00] At My Parents' House | I thought Michele was, like Nino, very attractive to women, but the difference was that Michele had his own beloved—Lina. Lina was the one who stirred up this passion in him, a passion that was not just about possession and domination, something to boast about, a form of revenge and base desire, as he said, but rather an intense affirmation of a woman's value.\n[1968-04-20 21:06:00] My parents' house | I thought of a kind of worship—not one of suppression, but a very precious love between men, a complex emotion, a man's love for a woman—the finest of women—a love that was resolute, almost brutal. I felt I was more like Giggia, and I understood that kind of humiliation.\n[1968-04-20T10:00:00] Small Park | One day, a photographer came and had me wait in the small park for two hours, along the main road, then at Mercato, he kept taking my pictures.\n[1968-04-21 15:00:00] Elena's House | I saw her that afternoon and met Lina and Enzo. I didn't tell them about my experience that day, nor about what I had done. It was out of love for her, and to protect the man who lived with her.\n[1968-04-21 15:10:00] Elena's House | I said to Enzo while Lina was in the kitchen getting the kids to eat. I heard, \"Lina wants to go back to Mergellina to live.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:15:00] Elena's House | I decided not to hide my attitude, so I said, \"Although it's not a good idea, I think it might help her calm down.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:20:00] Elena's House | I said that she was fine, that she now needed to find a new balance—perhaps that was what she thought herself. We needed to encourage her. Plus, so much time had passed. As far as I know, the situation in our Mergellina wasn't any worse than in Stazione Centrale.\n[1968-04-21 15:25:00] Elena's House | I saw Enzo shrug. I heard, \"I don't have any objections. I can get up earlier in the morning and come back later at night.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:25:30] The house of Stazione Centrale | \"I heard that Don Carlo's old house is for rent, and his kids have all moved to Casetta. Now the widow is also moving there.\" \"How much is the rent?\"\n[1968-04-21 15:26:00] Elena's house | I told him that the rent for Mergellina was cheaper than for Stazione Centrale, and Enzo agreed. I heard, \"Okay.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:26:30] Elena's House | \"I heard, 'You know, no matter what, there will be conflicts to face.' 'It's the same here.' 'There will be more trouble and higher demands in Mergellina.'\"\n[1968-04-21 15:27:00] Elena's House | I heard, \"Let's see.\" \"Will you be with her?\" \"Yes, if she wants me to be.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:30:00] Elena's House | I saw us go together to the kitchen to talk to Lina, and we told her about Don Carlo's house.\n[1968-04-21 15:31:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I know she had just fought with Gennaro, and now the child spends more time with his mother than he does with his neighbor. He's a bit lost, his freedom is gone, he has to give up some of his bad habits. He's already five years old, yet he still expects someone to feed him.\n[1968-04-21 15:32:00] Elena's House | I saw that at this moment, Lina was yelling at him again, and he threw the plate to the floor, shattering it into pieces.\n[1968-04-21 15:33:00] Elena's House | I saw her slap her son as we entered the kitchen, and she spoke to me in a very domineering tone. I heard, \"It was you who used a spoon as a plane to feed him.\" \"Only once.\" \"You shouldn't have done that.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:33:30] Elena's House | I said it, and I saw it. I heard, \"Never again.\" \"Yes, never, because after that you'll go off to be your writer, while I'll have to waste my time here.\"\n[1968-04-21 15:40:00] The house of Stazione Centrale | I saw her gradually calm down, and she cleaned the floor. Enzo told her that it was okay to look for an apartment in Mergellina. I thought about how I suppressed my resentment and told her about Don Carlo's house.\n[1968-04-21 15:45:00] Elena's house | I saw her, while she was comforting the child, listening to us carelessly. In the end, her reaction seemed to suggest that Enzo wanted to move, as if I had prompted her to make this choice, and she said so to us. I heard, \"Well, I'll do it your way.\"\n[1968-04-22 10:00:00] Don Carlo's house | I saw that the next day we would go together to look at the house. I know the condition of the house is terrible. I thought of Lina, who was excited: she loved the location of the house, which was at the very edge of Mergellina, almost right next to Mercato, and from the window you could see the gas pump of Pinochia's fiancé.\n[1968-04-22 10:10:00] Don Carlo's house | I saw Enzo say that the trucks coming and going on the main road, as well as the trainscheduling, were also there, and it might be noisy at night. I thought that the voices that accompanied our childhood were also beautiful.\n[1968-04-22 10:30:00] Don Carlo's house | I saw them negotiate a more reasonable price with the widow.\n[1968-04-22 20:00:00] Don Carlo's house | From that point on, every night, Enzo didn't return to Stazione Centrale, but came to Mergellina, carrying out a series of renovations to make the house more comfortable.\n[1968-04-25T10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw one of the last photos appearing on Il Messaggero, and I thought someone might block me on the road, or out of curiosity, read what I had written.\n[1968-04-25T10:05:00] Mergellina | I know, but no one is watching, including Alfonso Carracci, Pinocchia, Pinocchia, Giggia, and Michele, Michele doesn't read books like his brother Marcello.\n[1968-04-25T10:10:00] Mergellina | I didn't hear anyone say, \"Your book is great,\" or \"Your book is terrible.\" They just greeted me warmly and walked past.\n[1968-05-10 10:00:00] via Toledo | I knew it was already the end of May, and the day of my wedding was getting closer. I kept going back and forth between San Gregorio Armeno and Mergellina.\n[1968-05-10 10:01:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her, and she still asked me to help her clean that apartment and do her shopping. I thought about it, but Lina seemed completely unaware that the day was coming.\n[1968-05-10 10:05:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that we had bought a double bed and Gennaro's small bed, and we went together to apply for the phone service.",

Some greeted me, some greeted both of us, and some pretended not to see me or her. I thought that no matter the situation, Lina always looked at ease.\n[1968-05-10 11:10:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I remember once when we met Pinocchio, she was walking alone. She politely greeted us and then hurried past, as if she had an urgent matter.\n[1968-05-12 11:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I remember once when we met Stefano's mother Maria. I greeted her with Lina, and she immediately turned her head away.\n[1968-05-13 11:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I remember once when we ran into Stefano himself. He drove by, got out of his car, and just chatted with me in a cheerful way. He asked about my wedding.\n[1968-05-13 11:05:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him praise Mergellina, gently patted Gennaro's cheek, nodded to Lina, said hello, and then left. I know that they went there because of him, along with Pinocchia and their daughter.\n[1968-05-14 08:00:00] At the entrance of the primary school | I remember once when we saw Lina's father Fernando standing at the entrance of the primary school. I saw him bent and hunched, looking even older.\n[1968-05-14 08:01:00] The entrance of the primary school | I saw Lina was very excited at the time; she sent Gennaro to meet Grandpa.\n[1968-05-14 08:02:00] School gate | I tried to stop her, but she still went. Fernando seemed not to see his daughter at all. He looked at his grandson for a few seconds and said, word by word. I heard, \"Look at your mother, tell her she's a whore.\"\n[1968-05-14 08:03:00] School gate | I saw it and then turned around and walked away.\n[1968-05-15 10:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I know the most unsettling meeting was a few days before she was moving back to Mergellina. I thought that at the time it didn't seem like much, but in the end, it had a big impact on her.\n[1968-05-15 10:05:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I remember once, when we went out from home, we met Melina, who was holding her granddaughter Maria's hand. I knew this child was the daughter of Pinocchia and Stefano.\n[1968-05-15 10:06:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw Melina looking as distracted as ever, but she was dressed well, her hair was dyed, and she had heavy makeup on her face.\n[1968-05-15 10:07:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her recognize me, but not Lina, or maybe at first she just wanted to talk to me. I thought about the way she spoke to me, as if I were still her son Antonio's girlfriend.\n[1968-05-15 10:08:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her say that her son would be back from Germany soon, and in the letter, he had been asking about me.\n[1968-05-15 10:09:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself saying many pleasant things, praising her hair and clothes, and she looked happy.\n[1968-05-15 10:10:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | When I praised her granddaughter, she seemed even happier. I saw the little girl was shy, she tugged at her grandmother's dress.\n[1968-05-15 10:11:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | At that moment, she felt she should say something good about Gennaro, so she asked Lina. I heard, \"Is this your son?\"\n[1968-05-15 10:12:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that only at this moment, she seemed to remember Lina, because before that, she had been staring at Lina without saying a word. I thought she should remember: this is the woman who stole her husband.\n[1968-05-15 10:13:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her eyes fixed on Lina's sunken sockets, and she spoke very seriously. I heard her say, \"Lina, now you're ugly and thin, no wonder Stefano left you. Men like women with some flesh on them. Too thin, they don't know where to start, and they'll leave you.\"\n[1968-05-15 10:14:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | After seeing it, she turned her head away, her movement a bit too quick. She pointed at the little girl and almost shouted at Gennaro. I heard, \"You know, this is your sister. Kiss each other, my goodness! Look at how beautiful both of you are.\"\n[1968-05-15 10:15:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw Gennaro immediately kiss the girl, then obediently let the girl kiss him as well.\n[1968-05-15 10:16:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw Melina looking at the two faces close together and sighed. I heard, \"They both are like their father, almost identical.\"\n[1968-05-15 10:17:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | After making that statement, she seemed to have an urgent matter to attend to, and without saying a word, she pulled her granddaughter and left.\n[1968-05-15 10:18:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that throughout the whole thing, Lina didn't say a word, but I understood she was deeply shaken, just like when she was a child and saw Melina walking down the main road, chewing on a piece of purchased soft soap.\n[1968-05-15 10:19:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | As soon as I saw the woman and her granddaughter leave, she suddenly shuddered, ran one hand through her hair, and blinked her eyes, saying, \"I will end up like this.\" I heard and then she adjusted her hair again, muttering, \"Did you hear what she said?\"\n[1968-05-15 10:20:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"You're saying you're ugly and thin, but that's not true.\" \"I am ugly and thin, who the hell cares! I mean the thing about looking like someone else.\" \"What do you mean, looking like someone else?\"\n[1968-05-15 10:21:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"Two kids, Melina was right, they both look just like Stefano.\"\n[1968-05-15 10:22:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her suddenly laugh, after so much time, she was laughing again, that evil laugh she used to have.\n[1968-05-15 10:23:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her say it again. I heard, \"They are exactly the same, just like two drops of water.\"\n[1968-05-15 10:25:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had to leave, and I had already done everything I could for her. I thought I was about to get pulled into it too, thinking about useless things: like who the real father of Gennaro was, how accurate Melina's judgment really was, and the secret fluctuations in Lina's mind, along with what she knew or didn't know, what she had guessed, what she preferred to pretend to believe, and so on—all these things made me dizzy.\n[1968-05-15 11:00:00] Don Carlo's house | I saw that when Enzo went to work, we discussed this meeting, and I said some of the usual things people say. I heard, \"A woman always knows whose child she is.\"\n[1968-05-15 11:01:00] Don Carlo's house | I saw what I said. I heard, \"You always thought this son was Nino's, you had him because he was Nino's, and now just because of the madwoman Melina's words, you think the child is Stefano's?\"\n[1968-05-15 11:02:00] Don Carlo's house | I saw her laughing, and she looked happy. I heard, \"I'm really stupid, how could I not have figured it out!\"\n[1968-05-15 11:03:00] Don Carlo's house | I stopped speaking at the end. I thought it was something I couldn't understand. If this new belief could help her recover, that would be wonderful. But if it was just another manifestation of her unstable mental state, what could I do?\n[1968-05-15 12:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I've learned enough—I've already promoted my book in France, Spain, and Germany, and they'll translate it. I've also published two articles on L'Unità about the working conditions of women in factories in the Campania region; the editors have been very satisfied, and the publisher has been urging me to write a new novel. I thought, after all, I have a lot of my own things to do. I've already invested a lot of energy in Lina, and I can't always revolve around her messy affairs.\n[1968-05-15 14:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I bought a beige suit at Porto, encouraged by Adele Airota, intending to wear it at the wedding. I knew the outfit suited me well; the top was form-fitting and the bottom was a short skirt. I thought of Lina when I tried on this dress, of her luxurious wedding gown, and of the photo of her displayed in the window of the Rettifilo district. This contrast made me feel completely different from her, as if her wedding and mine belonged to entirely separate worlds.\n[1968-05-15 15:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I told her before that I wouldn't get married in a church, that I wouldn't wear a traditional wedding dress. I knew that Pietro only invited some close relatives to the wedding.\n[1968-05-15 15:01:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her asking me, but she didn't show much interest. I heard, \"Why?\" \"What do you mean, why?\" \"Why didn't you get married in the church?\" \"We aren't believers.\"\n[1968-05-15 15:02:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her mention the little article we wrote together when we were children. \"I heard, 'That God's finger, the Holy Spirit?' 'I'm growing up.'\"\n[1968-05-15 15:03:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"You should at least throw a party and invite your friends.\" \"Pietro doesn't want to.\" \"You're not even inviting me?\" \"Are you coming?\"\n[1968-05-15 15:04:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her shake her head and smile. I heard, \"No.\"",

    "text": "[1968-05-15T15:00:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw in the bookstore at Porto, where I first met one of my readers. I knew I would soon find out that this meeting had been organized by Adele Airota-Pietro, who was overseeing the promotion of the book remotely and had even come specially from Genoa to Porto.\n[1968-05-15T16:00:00] Pigneto | I saw her pass by the hotel where I was staying, and she spent the entire afternoon with me, trying to calm me down. I thought about how my hands kept shaking, and I found it hard to control myself. I felt a bitter taste in my mouth.\n[1968-05-15T16:05:00] Pigneto | I kept thinking especially about how angry I was at Pietro, because he was busy with something else at Borgo and didn't come to Porto.\n[1968-05-15T17:00:00] Mask Loc 005 Hotel | I saw Mariarosa at Porto before the signing session. She came over to greet me warmly and congratulated me, then had to leave because she had something else to attend to.\n[1968-05-15T18:00:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | When I went to the bookstore, I was extremely nervous.\n[1968-05-15T18:05:00] BOOKSTORE_LOC_005 | I saw that the lecture hall was full of people, so I lowered my head and went in. I thought I was going to pass out from excitement.\n[1968-05-15T18:10:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Adele Airota greeting many people present, all of whom were her friends and acquaintances. I knew she was sitting in the front row, giving me encouraging looks, and she occasionally spoke with a woman behind her, around her own age.\n[1968-05-15T18:15:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I knew that up until then, I had only spoken in public twice, both times under Franco Mari's insistence. The audience was his six or seven classmates, all of whom smiled and showed understanding.\n[1968-05-15T18:20:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw that this time was completely different; I had to face forty-something unfamiliar faces. I saw that they were all refined, cultured people. They looked at me silently, but their eyes were not very friendly. Most of them had to be there because of Pietro's family.\n[1968-05-15T18:25:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought about wanting to get up and run away.\n[1968-05-15T18:30:00] Bookstore | I saw it at that moment, but the ceremony had already begun. A senior critic—a university professor who was once very influential—spoke highly of the book.\n[1968-05-15T18:35:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought about what he had said, but I hadn't heard a single word—my mind was only on what I wanted to say.\n[1968-05-15T18:40:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw myself hunched over in my seat. I thought about my stomachache, and the whole world disappeared into a chaos. I couldn't find that authority within myself that could restore order.\n[1968-05-15T18:45:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw it, but I still pretended to be at ease. When it was my turn to speak, I didn't even know what I was saying—I just wanted to break the silence.\n[1968-05-15T18:50:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I realized I had made too many gestures, showing off my literary accomplishments and knowledge of classical culture too much. I saw that the hall was silent in the end.\n[1968-05-15T18:55:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I wondered how the people facing me were viewing me. What was the professor sitting beside me thinking about my dialogue? Adele Airota, beneath her delicate feminine appearance, had she already regretted supporting me?\n[1968-05-15T19:00:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw that when I looked at her, I immediately realized I was gazing at her with a pleading look, longing for her approval. It made me feel very ashamed to think about it.\n[1968-05-15T19:05:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | At that moment, the professor sitting beside me touched my arm, as if to calm me down. He then invited the people present to ask questions.\n[1968-05-15T19:10:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw many people awkwardly staring at their knees and the floor.\n[1968-05-15T19:15:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw the first person to speak was a man with thick glasses, older in age. Everyone present knew who he was, except me. I knew just from hearing his voice that Adele Airota made an impatient face.\n[1968-05-15T19:20:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw that man talking at length about the decline of the publishing industry, saying that what is published now is all about making money rather than literary value; critics and the supplement sections of newspapers also follow the trend, driven by profit.\n[1968-05-15T19:25:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I finally mentioned my book at the end, starting with a rather mocking tone, then bringing up those more daring passages, and he clearly used a hostile tone.\n[1968-05-15T19:30:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw my face turn red all of a sudden. I didn't answer his question, but instead spoke vaguely, drifting far off the subject.\n[1968-05-15T19:35:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I stopped speaking in the end, staring at the table with great embarrassment.\n[1968-05-15T19:40:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw the critic smiling and encouraging me with his eyes. I thought he wanted me to keep talking.\n[1968-05-15T19:45:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him ask dryly when he realized I didn't want to go on. I heard, \"Is there anything else?\"\n[1968-05-15T19:50:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw someone raising their hand at the end of the hall. I heard, \"Please speak.\"\n[1968-05-15T19:55:00] Bookstore | I saw a very tall young man, with long, messy hair and a thick, dark beard.\n[1968-05-15T20:00:00] BOOKSTORE_LOC_005 | I saw him speak about the person who had just spoken in a very contemptuous tone, and he also casually mocked the kind professor sitting beside me, saying. I heard her say, \"We live in a very narrow and closed-off country, where people only complain at any given moment, but no one can rise up, take charge, rebuild the country, and get everything running again.\"\n[1968-05-15T20:05:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw it through to the end, and he began praising the modernity in my novel. I thought to myself that I recognized it, it was Nino! Nino!\n[1969-04-10 19:00:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw the man with thick glasses, who mocked me and my book in front of everyone. I know it was a night more than forty years ago, in a library.\n[1969-04-10 19:00:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw myself trembling all over, and I answered him incoherently.\n[1969-04-10 19:01:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw later, Nino suddenly popped up. I saw him with a thick black beard on his face.\n[1969-04-10 19:01:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him speak to the guy who had been talking behind my back in a very harsh manner. I thought to myself that I had barely recognized him at all.\n[1969-04-10 19:02:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I had been silently calling his name—Nino, Nino—in my heart ever since that moment. I thought about how long it had been since I'd seen him, maybe four or five years— I felt cold all over, but my face was burning hot.\n[1969-04-10 19:02:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | After Nino finished speaking, the man raised his hand to ask a question. I realized clearly that he was angry, but I was too excited and my mind was too confused to understand immediately why he was angry.\n[1969-04-10 19:03:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought, but I realized that Nino's remarks had shifted the topic from literature to politics, and he had done so in a very domineering, almost disrespectful way.\n[1969-04-10 19:03:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought back to that time, when I hadn't paid much attention to what they were saying, because I was consumed by guilt. I couldn't forgive myself for not being able to control that confrontational situation, for being incoherent in front of people who were very cultured, even though I usually had a good way with words.\n[1969-04-10 19:04:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I knew that in high school, I had been in a situation that was against me, and back then, I had chosen to imitate Teacher Galiani as much as possible, using her tone and language.\n[1969-04-10 19:04:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I knew that, but when Borgo arrived, facing a more aggressive opponent, Galiani's role as a female model no longer worked. I thought of Franco Mari, Pietro, all the outstanding students, of course also the excellent teachers at the Normal School. They expressed themselves in a very complicated way, they wrote very carefully, they had strong analytical abilities and clear logic. I felt that none of these were things that Professor Galiani had.\n[1969-04-10 19:05:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | At that moment, I began training myself, I wanted to be like them. I thought to myself that sometimes I feel capable, I feel I can use my own language, overcome all the discomforts I face in this world, and control my emotions, avoiding hasty, careless expressions.\n[1969-04-10 19:05:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought that, in the end, I had mastered a way of speaking and writing, using carefully chosen words, steady, thoughtful, and tightly focused sentences, as well as a clean, formal, and refined style, which often left my opponents dialogueless.\n[1969-04-10 19:06:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought that night would go the way I hoped, but things didn't turn out that way.\n[1969-04-10 19:06:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I know that first, Adele Airota and her friends interpreted the novel, but later, that man with thick glasses made me feel shy. I thought about how I had been cast back into my original form, once again the girl from the slums, the daughter of a doorman, speaking with a southern accent, amazed at how far I had come, and how I had managed to play the role of a young, cultured female writer there.\n[1969-04-10 19:07:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | In the end, I lost my confidence, and my expression became confused, incoherent.\n[1969-04-10 19:07:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought of Nino's appearance, which made me lose all control. His defense of me once again confirmed my defeat. Suddenly, I lost the ability to speak.\n[1969-04-10 19:08:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I know we all came from the same background, and we both worked very hard to master that refined language. I thought about how I had discovered that Nino could use that language with such ease, not only refuting the man before him effortlessly, but also, when he felt it necessary, occasionally adding other elements into that refined Italian.",

    "text": "[1969-04-10 19:08:30] Bookstore Porto | I thought of him, speaking in a carefree and scornful tone, making people feel that the old professor's way of talking was somewhat ridiculous.\n[1969-04-10 19:09:00] Bookstore Porto | I saw the result, I saw the old professor about to speak. I thought to myself: He must be really angry right now. He criticized my book before, and now he's surely going to judge me even more harshly, humiliating me and belittling Nino, who defended me.\n[1969-04-10 19:09:30] Bookstore Porto | I saw that the man was talking about something else: he didn't mention my novel, and never mentioned my book again.\n[1969-04-10 19:10:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw that he was only responding to some of Nino's remarks. Although Nino had said it several times, that wasn't the core of his argument, for example—aristocratic arrogance, literature against authority.\n[1969-04-10 19:10:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him, his voice no longer low and somber, but instead using a mocking, affected tone to repeat those expressions (thus, the pride in knowledge had now been defined as arrogance, so even literature had become anti-authoritative?); then he carefully discussed the word \"authority.\" I thought to myself that I only knew for sure that what had made that man angry was the political implication in those words, and he didn't like those kinds of expressions.\n[1969-04-10 19:11:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | \"I heard him say, 'Thank God,' and he warned, 'Be careful of those uneducated young people. They'll talk nonsense about anything, and they'll quote some reckless university professor's stupid remarks.'\"\n[1969-04-10 19:11:30] BOOKSTORE 005 | I saw him talking about the same subject for a long time, addressing the public, not targeting Nino or me at all. I thought about how he had started attacking the elderly critic sitting next to me, and then directly targeted Adele Airota, who had actually been his original target.\n[1969-04-10 19:12:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | \"I'm not targeting these young people,\" he concluded, \"but I want to point out that educated adults, driven by self-interest, follow foolish fashions like sycophants.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:12:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him about to leave, and he whispered. I heard, \"Sorry, excuse me, thank you.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:13:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw everyone present stand up to let him pass, although there was some hostility, they all seemed somewhat indifferent.\n[1969-04-10 19:13:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Adele Airota also make a somewhat dejected gesture, and politely said, \"Thank you, goodbye, take care.\" I realized then that I had finally understood: he was a big man, so important.\n[1969-04-10 19:14:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | At that moment, I saw how Nino displayed in a domineering, even annoying way that he knew who he was dealing with. I thought maybe it was precisely because he was a big shot, which surprised everyone.\n[1969-04-10 19:14:30] Bookstore Porto | I heard him call the man \"Professor\" and he said, \"Professor, where are you going? Please don't leave.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:15:00] Bookstore Porto | I saw that Nino had long legs, and in a few steps he was standing in front of him, blocking the professor's path, and said something to the professor in that new language. I saw that I was sitting in my place, I could hear a bit indistinctly, and I didn't quite understand what was being said, but the words should have been as clear as steel wires under the bright sun.\n[1969-04-10 19:15:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw the old gentleman standing there, motionless, not losing his patience immediately. After a while, he made a gesture, meaning: step aside.\n[1969-04-10 19:16:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him walking toward the door.\n[1969-04-10 19:16:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | When I thought about leaving the table, my mind was in a terrible mess. I found it hard to believe that Nino was really there, in that hall at Porto.\n[1969-04-10 19:17:00] BOOKSTORE_LOC_005 | I saw it, he walked steadily, smiling as he came toward me.\n[1969-04-10 19:17:30] Bookstore Porto | I saw us shaking hands. I saw and felt his hand was very hot, my hand was cold.\n[1969-04-10 19:18:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I heard us both saying that it was a joy to meet again after such a long time.\n[1969-04-10 19:18:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I knew that the worst moment of that evening had passed, and now he was standing in front of me, real and tangible. I was very excited, and my bad mood gradually eased.\n[1969-04-10 19:19:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw myself introducing Nino to the critic who hadenthusiastically praised my novel. \n\n(Note: The term \"enthusiastically praised\" is translated as \"enthusiastically praised\" to maintain the original tone and meaning. If you'd like a more natural or stylistic variation, let me know.) \n\nRevised translation:  \nI saw myself introducing Nino to the critic who had enthusiastically praised my novel. I heard myself say that he was a friend of mine from San Gregorio Armeno, we were high school classmates.\n[1969-04-10 19:19:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw the professor critic, who had also been subtly mocked and attacked by Nino just a moment ago, but he was behaving very politely.\n[1969-04-10 19:20:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him speaking very enthusiastically about San Gregorio Armeno, and the way he spoke to Nino was as if Nino were an outstanding, encouraging student. I heard him say that Nino did well, that the man had indeed deserved what he got.\n[1969-04-10 19:20:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Nino explain that he had lived in Porto for many years, that he was studying economic geography, and that he smiled as he said he was the lowest-ranking teacher at the university, the assistant.\n[1969-04-10 19:21:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I found his words amusing. I thought there was no longer that cynical bitterness he had as a child.\n[1969-04-10 19:21:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought to myself that now he was wearing a new set of armor, lighter than the one I had been infatuated with when I was in middle school. It was as if he had shed all unnecessary burdens, allowing him to strike with more grace and speed.\n[1969-04-10 19:22:00] Bookstore Porto | I saw that he wasn't wearing a wedding ring, and I felt relieved.\n[1969-04-10 19:22:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw that at that moment, a female friend of Adele Airota approached me and asked me to sign a book. I thought it was an exciting thing, the first time someone was asking me to sign.\n[1969-04-10 19:23:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought about it and hesitated, because I didn't want to miss Nino, not even for a moment, but I also wanted to change the impression I left on him, to make him think that I was no longer that clumsy, foolish girl.\n[1969-04-10 19:23:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him chatting with the old professor—Professor Talantano—and I politely greeted my readers.\n[1969-04-10 19:24:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw them, but those books were brand new, with the smell of ink, completely different from the old, smelly ones I used to borrow from the Mergellina library with Lina when we were kids. I thought I wanted to sign quickly, but I felt I shouldn't hastily ruin these new books with a ballpoint pen.\n[1969-04-10 19:24:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw myself showing off the beautiful calligraphy that Professor Oliviero had taught me, writing some carefully composed dedications. I saw that this made the several ladies waiting behind very impatient.\n[1969-04-10 19:25:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I could feel my heart racing as I wrote the dedication, and I kept glancing at Nino. I thought about how scared I was that he might leave.\n[1969-04-10 19:25:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw that Nino hadn't left. Now Adele Airota had also approached him and Professor Tarrantano; he spoke to her with respect, yet also with ease and charm.",

    "text": "[1969-04-10 19:26:00] BOOKSTORE 005 | I thought of the image that came to my mind of Nino talking to Teacher Galiani in the school corridor during high school, but in an instant, he had transformed from that outstanding high school student into the young man before me.\n[1969-04-10 19:26:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I know the student of Vomero, my married friend's lover; that lost boy hiding in the bathroom of a store in Piazza Martiri; Gennaro's father, yet I've never met the child. I thought to myself, back then he really shouldn't have taken that detour; it made all of us suffer.\n[1969-04-10 19:27:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought, of course, that Lina's intrusion had made him lose himself. Clearly, in that situation, the experience had been just a brief episode, although exciting, it had greatly affected him physically and mentally, but that was over now. Nino had found himself again, and I was glad.\n[1969-04-10 19:27:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought to myself: I should tell Lina that I saw Nino, that he's doing fine. But in the end, I changed my mind: No, I can't tell her.\n[1969-04-10 19:28:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Adele Airota gently take my hand as I finished writing the dedication. I saw that almost everyone had left the hall.\n[1969-04-10 19:28:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I heard her praise me, saying that I had spoken very well in introducing the novel, and that I had also done well in responding to the man's terrible dialogue—that's how she described the man with glasses.\n[1969-04-10 19:29:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw her looking at me, and I had Nino and Tullante testify on my behalf, both of whom of course said a lot of good things about me. I thought to myself that I was perfectly clear—what she said wasn't true.\n[1969-04-10 19:29:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Nino looking at me very seriously at last. I heard, \"You don't know, this girl was already very smart in high school, read a lot of books, and was very brave and beautiful.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:30:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | At that moment, he spoke in a polite and refined manner, humorously recounting my early conflict with the religious teacher. I felt my face grow hot.\n[1969-04-10 19:30:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Adele Airota there, listening and sometimes smiling. I heard her say, \"In our family, everyone immediately recognized Elena's qualities.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:31:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I heard and then she announced that she had reserved a restaurant not far from there, and she wanted us to go have dinner together.\n[1969-04-10 19:31:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw myself awkwardly muttering that I was tired and not hungry. I thought about my worries.\n[1969-04-10 19:32:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I thought I needed to make them understand that it had been a long time since I'd seen Nino, and I hoped to go out with him before returning to the hotel to talk.\n[1969-04-10 19:32:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I knew that dinner was a celebration for me, a thank-you for Tarantano's support of the book. It would have been very improper of me not to go, but I couldn't help myself.\n[1969-04-10 19:33:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw Adele Airota give me a mocking look, then, as if to compensate me for the sacrifice I'd made, she whispered mysteriously. I heard her say that she had also invited my friend along, \"I've prepared a surprise for you.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:33:30] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw myself looking at Nino uneasily. I wondered if he would accept the invitation.\n[1969-04-10 19:34:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | I saw him glance at his watch and finally accepted. I heard him say that he didn't want to disturb us.\n[1969-04-10 19:34:30] Street of Porto | I saw us leaving the bookstore. Adele Airota was very careful, she and Tarrantano walked ahead, and I followed with Nino.\n[1969-04-10 19:35:00] Street of Porto | I thought to myself that I would immediately realize I didn't know what to say to him, and I was afraid that as soon as I opened my mouth, I would say the wrong thing.\n[1969-04-10 19:35:30] Street 005 | I saw Nino break the silence, and to keep the conversation from lagging, he praised my book again, then spoke of the Pietro family with admiration (he described them as \"one of the most important and civilized families in Italy\").\n[1969-04-10 19:36:00] Street of Porto | I saw him and he told me he had learned from Adele Airota that I was engaged to Pietro, and he congratulated me. I heard him say he knew Mariarosa (\"She was always on my mind, and two weeks ago, we had a big fight.\").\n[1969-04-10 19:36:30] Street 005 | I saw, especially, that he spoke with respect of the head of the Pietro family—Guido Airota, Professor Pietro. \"He's a truly remarkable man.\" What surprised me was how familiar he seemed with Pietro's book on Dionysian worship.\n[1969-04-10 19:37:00] Street of Porto | I thought about the fact that he knew I was engaged, which made me a bit uncomfortable. I realized that his praise for my novel was just an introduction, allowing him to praise the whole Pietro family and Pietro's book, which made me even more uneasy.\n[1969-04-10 19:37:30] Street of Porto | I saw that I had interrupted him, so I asked how he was. But his answer was vague, just mentioning a small book he was about to publish. I thought he found the book boring, but he had to publish it.\n[1969-04-10 19:38:00] Street 005 | I asked him about his life when he first arrived at Porto, whether he had faced any difficulties. He gave me a vague answer, talking about the problems he had when he first came from the south with no money in his pocket.\n[1969-04-10 19:38:30] Street of Porto | I heard him suddenly ask me, \"Have you gone back to live in San Gregorio Armeno?\"\n[1969-04-10 19:38:35] Street of Porto | I heard, \"It's currently.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:38:40] Street of Porto | I heard, \"Living in Mergellina?\"\n[1969-04-10 19:38:45] Street of Porto | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:38:50] Street of Porto | I heard, \"I have completely cut off all relations with my father, and I no longer see my family.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:38:55] Street of Porto | I heard, \"That's really a pity.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:39:00] Street 005 | \"I heard, 'It's probably better this way. It's just a pity I've heard nothing more about Lina.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:39:30] Street 005 | I thought to myself at that moment: I was wrong, Lina had never left his life. He came to this bookstore wasn't because of me, but to find out news about Lina.\n[1969-04-10 19:40:00] Street of Porto | I thought again: In these years, if he really wanted to find out about Lina's news, he would surely have found a way.\n[1969-04-10 19:40:30] Street of Porto | I saw myself, acting on a sudden impulse, saying in a straightforward tone that I didn't want to talk about it anymore. I heard, \"She has left her husband and is now living with another man.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:40:35] Street of Porto | I heard, \"Did she have a boy or a girl?\"\n[1969-04-10 19:40:40] Street of Porto | I heard \"a boy.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:40:45] Street of Porto | I saw him make an unhappy face. I heard someone say, \"Lina is very brave, even too brave. But she can't accept reality, she can't accept others, and she can't accept herself. Loving her is a very difficult thing, a very painful experience.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:40:50] Street of Porto | \"I heard 'What do you mean?'\"\n[1969-04-10 19:40:55] Street of Porto | I heard, \"She doesn't know what dedication is.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:41:00] Street of Porto | I heard, \"Maybe you're overreacting.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:41:05] Street of Porto | I heard, \"No, she really has a lot of problems: her mind and body are both messed up, even her sexuality is.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:41:30] Street of Porto | I kept thinking about the last few words he said—\"in terms of sex too\"—which surprised me the most. Could it be that Nino's evaluation of his relationship with Lina was actually negative?\n[1969-04-10 19:42:00] Street of Porto | I couldn't stop thinking about what he had just said to me, even bringing up something about sex? It really made me uneasy.\n[1969-04-10 19:42:30] Street of Porto | I saw Adele Airota and the dark, shadowy figure of her friend walking ahead of me. I thought my unease had turned into anxiety, and I felt that bringing up sex was also a prelude; he must now want to be more explicit.\n[1969-04-10 19:43:00] Street 005 | I know that many years ago, Stefano also told me something similar after he got married. He told me about the problems between him and Lina, but when he said it, he didn't mention sex.\n[1969-04-10 19:43:30] Street of Porto | I know that all the men in Mergellina, when talking about the woman they love, can never bring up the issue of sex. I thought, for example, how Pasquale told me about his sexual issues with Pinochcia, which was truly unimaginable!\n[1969-04-10 19:44:00] Street of Porto | I know that, in any case, Antonio would be even less likely to talk to Pinocchia or Giggia about my issues regarding sex. Men can talk about such things, and they do so in a very crude way, but we girls don't care about that, and between men and women, these topics are never discussed.\n[1969-04-10 19:44:30] Street of Porto | I thought about how I felt, Nino—the new Nino—who thought it was perfectly normal to talk to me about his sexual relationship with my friend Lina.\n[1969-04-10 19:45:00] Street of Porto | I saw and immediately changed the subject. I felt very embarrassed, I thought, I wouldn't tell Lina about any of these things either.\n[1969-04-10 19:45:30] Street of Porto | I saw that, and I pretended to be very cool and said. I heard her say, \"All that's past now, we shouldn't be too sad. Tell me about yourself. What are you researching? What's your future look like at the university? Where do you live? Are you living alone?\"\n[1969-04-10 19:46:00] Street of Porto | I thought, but when I said these things, I must have been too passionate; he should have felt it, and I avoided his topic.\n[1969-04-10 19:46:30] Restaurant Entrance | I saw him with a mocking expression, smiling slightly, about to answer when we arrived at the restaurant and walked in.\n[1969-04-10 19:47:00] Vomero | I saw Adele Airota assigning seats to everyone: I sat next to Nino, across from Talantano, she sat next to Talantano, across from Nino.\n[1969-04-10 19:47:30] Restaurant Porto | I saw that we had ordered our food, and at that moment, our conversation turned to the man in glasses.\n[1969-04-10 19:48:00] Restaurant Porto | I know he is an Italian literature professor who has been writing for Corriere della Sera for a long time. He is a member of the Christian Democratic Party. I thought to myself that I now understood.\n[1969-04-10 19:48:30] Vomero | I saw that neither Adele Airota nor her friends were holding back anymore, unlike in the bookstore, where they had controlled themselves. They now spoke freely.\n[1969-04-10 19:49:00] Restaurant Porto | I heard them say many bad things about that man, then strongly praised Nino. I heard them say he did well, that he should have pressured the old man.\n[1969-04-10 19:49:30] Restaurant Porto | I thought what especially pleased them was what Nino said to the old man when he left the hall, something they all heard but which I didn't.\n[1969-04-10 19:50:00] Restaurant Porto | I remembered every word, and Nino laughed, saying he didn't remember.\n[1969-04-10 19:50:30] Restaurant Porto | I heard it, but later those words were repeated, maybe even altered on the spot. It went something like: \"And you? To defend authority and the statements of authority, you'd even set democracy aside.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:51:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw that from then on, only the three of them were talking, and they were having a very lively conversation.",

    "text": "[1969-04-10 19:51:30] Restaurant: Porto | I heard them talking about spies, the Greek issue, secret trials and torture, the Vietnam issue, and the immaturity of student movements in Italy, Europe, and even around the world. They also mentioned a article by Professor Pietro published in \"La Stampa,\" which discussed the teaching and research conditions in universities.\n[1969-04-10 19:52:00] Restaurant Porto | I heard Nino say that he agreed with every word Professor Pietro had said.\n[1969-04-10 19:52:30] Restaurant Porto | \"I'll tell my daughter Mariarosa that you liked the article,\" said Adele Airota, \"she thought it was written terribly.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:53:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Mariarosa is only interested in things this world cannot give her.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:53:30] Vomero | I heard, \"That's exactly right, that's how she is.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:54:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw myself silently listening from the side. I thought about the article about my future father-in-law that I knew nothing about, and it made me very uncomfortable.\n[1969-04-10 19:54:30] Restaurant: Porto | I knew that before all that, I first had to deal with exams, then my graduation thesis, and finally that hastily published book, which took up most of my time.\n[1969-04-10 19:55:00] Restaurant Porto | I know I have barely paid attention to student movements, demonstrations, conflicts, the injured, those who were arrested, and the bloodshed. I thought about the things happening in the world, and I realized I had only understood the surface of it.\n[1969-04-10 19:55:30] Restaurant Porto | I know I've already left the university, and about what's happening there, I can only find out through Pietro's complaints. In his letter, he describes the student movement like this: \"the silly things that happened at Borgo.\"\n[1969-04-10 19:56:00] Vomero | I thought about the outcome: many things had happened around me, and the people I dined with were very familiar with these events, especially Nino, while I was not very clear about them.\n[1969-04-10 19:56:30] Vomero | I saw myself sitting beside him, listening to him speak, our arms brushing against each other, just a touch through our clothes. I thought about it, and I was still excited.\n[1969-04-10 19:57:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw him listing the number of students registered at the school. I thought he still kept his love for numbers, which were simply too many.\n[1969-04-10 19:57:30] Vomero | I heard him also mention the actual capacity of the school building, and the working hours of those \"powerful people.\" Those individuals weren't devoted to teaching or doing research; instead, they sat in the parliament, or worked as consultants for administrative bodies, or as consultants for private companies.\n[1969-04-10 19:58:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw Adele Airota there, listening, and her friend was also listening, occasionally interjecting a few words. They mentioned names I'd never heard of before.\n[1969-04-10 19:58:30] Vomero | I thought about how I felt excluded.\n[1969-04-10 19:59:00] Restaurant Porto | I thought about celebrating the publication of my book, but that was no longer something they considered. My future mother-in-law seemed to have forgotten the surprise she had mentioned.\n[1969-04-10 19:59:30] Restaurant Porto | I said quietly, I'll be back a moment. Adele Airota casually waved her hand, while Nino kept speaking with his usual enthusiasm.\n[1969-04-10 20:00:00] Vomero | I heard Tarentano whispering to me: \"Then you'd better come back soon, I want to hear your opinion.\" I thought he must have noticed I was getting annoyed.\n[1969-04-10 20:00:30] Vomero | I saw myself saying with a pale smile. I heard, \"I don't have any opinion.\"\n[1969-04-10 20:01:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw him smile this time. I heard him say, \"Writers can always come up with one.\"\n[1969-04-10 20:01:30] Restaurant Porto | I heard, \"Maybe, I'm not a writer.\"\n[1969-04-10 20:02:00] Restaurant Porto | I heard, \"Yes, you're a writer.\"\n[1969-04-10 20:02:30] Vomero | I saw myself going to the bathroom.\n[1969-04-10 20:03:00] Restaurant Toilet, Porto | I thought of Nino, who always had the ability to show me how outdated I was as soon as he opened his mouth.\n[1969-04-10 20:03:30] Vomero | I thought I should continue studying, I thought. How could I have been so careless and unmotivated?\n[1969-04-10 20:04:00] Restaurant Toilet, Porto | I thought, of course, if I wanted to, I could also show a little enthusiasm and pretend to understand.\n[1969-04-10 20:04:30] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I realized I couldn't go on like this. I had learned so much that didn't matter, while the essential knowledge remained beyond my grasp.\n[1969-04-10 20:05:00] Restaurant Toilet, Porto | I know that after my story with Franco Mari ended, I gradually lost the curiosity for the world that he had passed on to me.\n[1969-04-10 20:05:30] Restaurant Toilet Room | I thought about my engagement to Pietro, but it didn't help me at all. I lost interest in anything he wasn't interested in.\n[1969-04-10 20:06:00] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought about how different Pietro was from his father, mother, and sister! Especially, how different he was from Nino!\n[1969-04-10 20:06:30] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought maybe, for him, my novel shouldn't have been written at all. He accepted it almost impatiently, as if it had betrayed the academic world.\n[1969-04-10 20:07:00] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought, maybe I was being too dramatic, all of this is my fault.\n[1969-04-10 20:07:30] Restaurant Toilet Mask Loc 005 | I realized I was a girl with very limited vision, able to focus only on one thing and ignore everything else. Now I want to change this situation.\n[1969-04-10 20:08:00] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought that after this boring dinner, I would start changing myself, I would take Nino away and force him to walk with me all night.\n[1969-04-10 20:08:30] Restaurant Toilet Room | I thought I would ask him what books, what movies, what music I should watch and listen to. I would pull on his arm and say, \"I'm so cold...\"\n[1969-04-10 20:09:00] Restaurant Restroom | I thought that this incomplete sentence was a vague hint, and I would hide my anxiety.\n[1969-04-10 20:09:30] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought to myself, this might be our only chance. Tomorrow I'll leave and never see him again.\n[1969-04-10 20:10:00] Restaurant Toilet, Porto | I saw that, and I looked at myself in the mirror with anger. What met my eyes was a face full of exhaustion, with small pimples on the jawline and dark circles under the eyes, a sign that my period was about to come.\n[1969-04-10 20:10:30] Restaurant Toilet Mask Loc 005 | I thought again about how short and ugly I was, with such large breasts.\n[1969-04-10 20:11:00] Restaurant Toilet Room | I realized that from the very beginning, I should have understood that he had never really liked me. He chose Lina instead of me, and that was no coincidence.\n[1969-04-10 20:11:30] Restaurant Toilet Mask Loc 005 | What did I think, and what was the result? She had problems in that area, Nino said.\n[1969-04-10 20:12:00] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I wish I hadn't changed the subject back then. I should have shown my curiosity and encouraged him to keep talking.\n[1969-04-10 20:12:30] Restaurant Toilet Mask Loc 005 | I thought that if he brought it up again next time, I should be more open-minded. I would say to him, \"I'd like to ask, what does it mean when a girl has problems in the sexual aspect?\"\n[1969-04-10 20:13:00] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought I would explain that, if necessary, I would correct myself, not knowing whether that was something that could be corrected.",

He would have thought I was just like Lila, also broken.\n[1969-04-10 20:15:00] Restaurant Toilet Room | I wondered if he might be discussing this behind my back with my friend from Borgo Normal School, or even with Mariarosa?\n[1969-04-10 20:15:30] Restaurant Toilet Room | I thought to myself that his words were too offensive, and I had to accuse him.\n[1969-04-10 20:16:00] Vomero | I thought I should tell him that a child, little Gennaro, was born from that sexual encounter he had criticized so much, and he was very smart.\n[1969-04-10 20:16:30] Restaurant Restroom | I thought I should say that what you're saying is wrong, that the issue can't be reduced to who has problems with sex. Lina has ruined herself for you.\n[1969-04-10 20:17:00] Restaurant Toilet - Porto | I thought to myself that when I got rid of Adele Airota and her friends, and when Nino accompanied me to the hotel, I would say those words to him.\n[1969-04-10 20:17:30] Vomero | I saw myself coming out of the bathroom and returning to the dining room. I saw that I had missed something, and the situation had changed.\n[1969-04-10 20:18:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw my future mother-in-law waving at me the moment she saw me, and she greeted me with great enthusiasm. \"I heard, 'Your surprise has finally arrived.'\"\n[1969-04-10 20:18:30] Vomero | I saw the surprise was Pietro, sitting next to Adele Airota.\n[1969-04-10 20:19:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw my fiancé stand up and embrace me the moment he saw me.\n[1969-04-10 20:19:30] Vomero | I know I never mentioned Nino to him. I mentioned Antonio, but not often. I just told him about my relationship with Franco Mari, which was well known among the students at Borgo Normal School.\n[1969-04-10 20:20:00] Vomero | I know I have never even mentioned Nino's name.\n[1969-04-10 20:20:30] Vomero | I thought about how this was a painful thing, these awful events that made me feel ashamed—telling this story meant confessing, and I had always loved someone. To explain why I loved him, I needed to clarify Nino's meaning, to speak of Lina and Ischia.\n[1969-04-10 20:21:00] Restaurant Porto | I know that, in the end, it will force me to admit that the plot I told in the book—the sexual relationship between the heroine and the mature man—stemmed from my experience on the Maronti beach, a choice made by a desperate girl.\n[1969-04-10 20:21:30] Vomero | I thought about how so much time had passed, and now I feel that it was a really disgusting thing, but it's my own business, and I have to bury it in my heart.\n[1969-04-10 20:22:00] Restaurant: Porto | I thought that if Pietro knew this, he would surely understand why I was so unhappy to see him.\n[1969-04-10 20:22:30] Restaurant Porto | I saw him sitting at the head of the table, between his mother and Nino, devouring a steak and drinking wine.\n[1969-04-10 20:23:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw him looking at me, and he sensed my bad mood, so he acted a bit carefully.\n[1969-04-10 20:23:30] Restaurant Porto | Of course I thought of that; he felt a bit guilty because he hadn't been there in a very important moment of my life.\n[1969-04-10 20:24:00] Restaurant Porto | I thought he might feel I didn't take the matter seriously enough, and that could make me seem unloving to him, especially since he left me alone to face those unfamiliar faces without his spiritual support.\n[1969-04-10 20:24:30] Restaurant Porto | I couldn't explain it to him, and I kept my face dark and said nothing precisely because he had arrived now, standing between me and Nino.\n[1969-04-10 20:25:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw Nino—though he was sitting next to me, he didn't say a word to me. I thought of something that made me even more unhappy.\n[1969-04-10 20:25:30] Restaurant Porto | I saw him pour wine for Pietro, ask him to smoke his own cigarette, and light it for him. I thought that Pietro had come and it made me happy.\n[1969-04-10 20:26:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw that now, both of them were inhaling smoke. I heard them talking about how it's tiring to drive from Borgo to Porto, and also about the pleasure of driving.\n[1969-04-10 20:26:30] Vomero | I saw Nino was thin and tall, his voice high-pitched and full of enthusiasm. I thought what surprised me was the difference between them.\n[1969-04-10 20:27:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw Pietro, short and stocky, with a messy, somewhat ridiculous head of hair, a high forehead, big cheekbones, his face freshly shaven and pale, and his voice deep and low.\n[1969-04-10 20:27:30] Restaurant Porto | I knew this was unusual for Pietro, because he had always been focused only on his own affairs and wasn't interested in socializing. I thought they seemed happy to have met each other.\n[1969-04-10 20:28:00] Vomero | I saw Nino showing great interest in his research (he had read an article that opposed drinking wine, opposed any form of intoxication, and promoted milk and honey), and he wanted to lead Pietro into discussing the topic.\n[1969-04-10 20:28:30] Vomero | I saw it, but this time he gave in. He patiently corrected that view and then began to open up. I know that when it comes to these topics, my fiancé has always tended to say nothing.\n[1969-04-10 20:29:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw when Pietro was speaking freely, Adele Airota interjected. \"I'm not talking about anything else,\" she said to her son, \"where's the surprise you prepared for Elena?\"\n[1969-04-10 20:29:30] Restaurant Porto | I looked at her, somewhat confused. Did I think there were other surprises?\n[1969-04-10 20:30:00] Restaurant Porto | I thought, isn't it enough that Pietro drove nonstop to come here just for my celebration dinner? I felt curious.\n[1969-04-10 20:30:30] Restaurant Porto | At that moment, my fiancé made a discontented face. I understood his reaction—that was the expression he would wear when forced by circumstances to speak well of himself.\n[1969-04-10 20:31:00] Restaurant Porto | I saw him announce it to me, almost muttering it. I heard that he officially became a very young professor, and Mergellina University appointed him as a full professor.\n[1969-04-10 20:31:30] Restaurant: Porto | I thought of the way he spoke, as if a miracle had suddenly turned him into a professor.\n[1969-04-10 20:32:00] Restaurant Porto | I knew he was just like that—never boasted about himself, and never mentioned the severe trials he had faced. I thought about it so much that I didn't even realize how highly regarded he was as a scholar.\n[1969-04-10 20:32:30] Restaurant Porto | I saw it then, just like that, he said the news almost with contempt. I thought it was as if his mother had forced him to say it, as if it meant nothing to him at all.\n[1969-04-10 20:33:00] Vomero | I thought, but in reality, it meant that he had achieved remarkable success at a young age, meaning financial security, meaning he could leave Borgo and easily escape its political and cultural atmosphere.\n[1969-04-10 20:33:30] Restaurant Porto | I know he's had a hard time with the city these past few months. I thought I didn't know why.\n[1969-04-10 20:34:00] Restaurant Porto | I thought this especially meant that in that autumn, or by the earliest spring of the following year, we would get married, and I would leave San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1969-04-10 20:34:30] Vomero | I noticed that no one mentioned the final thing, but everyone congratulated Pietro and me, including Nino.\n[1969-04-10 20:35:00] Vomero | I saw him look at his watch after hearing the news, then speak bitterly about the academic titles at the university, and finally apologize to everyone, saying he had to leave.",

    "text": "[1969-04-10 20:35:30] Restaurant Porto | I saw everyone stand up.\n[1969-04-10 20:36:00] Restaurant Porto | I didn't know what to do, I felt a sharp pain in my chest, and I really wanted to catch his gaze.\n[1969-04-10 20:36:30] Restaurant Porto | I thought it was all over, that I had lost a chance, and those wishes had all come to nothing.\n[1969-04-10 20:37:00] Street of Porto | I saw us walking down the road, and I hoped he would give me a phone number, an address, but he just shook my hand and wished me all the best.\n[1969-04-10 20:37:30] Street of Porto | I thought that from that moment on, every move he made was meant to get rid of me.\n[1969-04-10 20:38:00] Street of Porto | When we said goodbye, I smiled and waved a hand as if holding a pen. In reality, it was a plea: You know where I live, write to me, please. But he had already turned away.\n[1969-04-10 20:38:30] Street of Porto | I thanked Adele Airota and her friends, especially for the trouble they had gone through for me, and for my book.\n[1969-04-10 20:39:00] Street of Porto | I saw both of them sincerely praising Nino, saying many good things about him. I thought that his cuteness and intelligence were all because of me.\n[1969-04-10 20:39:30] Street 005 | I saw Pietro saying nothing, just making an impatient gesture when his mother told him to go back home early.\n[1969-04-10 20:40:00] Street of Porto | I heard myself say right away, \"You don't need to go with me to the hotel, you and your mother go back.\" I know they all live with Mariarosa.\n[1969-04-10 20:40:30] Street of Porto | I thought no one would believe me, but in reality, I was really unhappy and just wanted to be alone.\n[1969-04-10 20:41:00] Street of Porto | I saw that all along the way, my mood was terrible, and my fiancé could hardly communicate with me.\n[1969-04-10 20:41:30] Street of Porto | I heard myself sigh, I don't like Mergellina. I thought it wasn't real.\n[1969-04-10 20:42:00] Street of Porto | I heard myself say that I never wanted to write again, that I wanted to teach. I thought that wasn't real either.\n[1969-04-10 20:42:30] Street 005 | I heard myself say that I was tired and sleepy. I thought that wasn't real either.\n[1969-04-10 20:43:00] Street of Porto | I saw that there was more to it, and when Pietro suddenly announced to me that he wanted to go to San Gregorio Armeno to meet my parents, I shouted at him. \"I heard, 'Are you crazy? You should leave my parents alone. You're not suitable for them, and they're not suitable for you.'\"\n[1969-04-10 20:43:30] Street of Porto | I heard him ask me, worriedly, \"You don't want to marry me anymore?\"\n[1969-04-10 20:44:00] Street 005 | I almost said, \"Yes, I don't want to marry you anymore,\" but I immediately held it back. I know it's not true.\n[1969-04-10 20:44:30] Street of Porto | I heard myself say softly, \"I'm sorry, I'm feeling down. Of course, I want to marry you.\"\n[1969-04-10 20:45:00] Street of Porto | I saw myself grabbing one of his hands, our fingers entwined.\n[1969-04-10 20:45:30] Street of Porto | I thought he was a smart man, very learned, and also kind. I really liked him, and I didn't want him to suffer.\n[1969-04-10 20:46:00] Street of Porto | I thought that, even so, when I took his hand and told him I wanted to marry him, I clearly knew that if he hadn't shown up at the restaurant that night, I would have tried to get Nino.\n[1969-04-10 20:46:30] Street of Porto | I thought of it, but I couldn't admit it; Pietro shouldn't have been treated that way.\n[1969-04-10 20:47:00] Street of Porto | I thought, of course, if I got Nino, I would have no regrets. I would find a way to attract Nino, just as I had in the past years, from elementary school through high school, all the way to Ischia and the period at Martiri Square.\n[1969-04-10 20:47:30] Street of Porto | I thought about how, despite not liking the thing he said about Lina, that sentence made me very uneasy.\n[1969-04-10 20:48:00] Street 005 | I thought I would end up with Nino, but I would never tell Pietro.\n[1969-04-10 20:48:30] Street of Porto | I thought maybe I would tell Lina about it, but who knows when that would be—perhaps when we were both old, I imagined, and by then, neither of us would care about such things anymore.\n[1969-04-10 20:49:00] Street of Porto | I thought about time, as with other things, it was decisive.\n[1969-04-10 20:49:30] Street of Porto | I thought about having Nino, maybe just for one night, and he would leave in the morning.\n[1969-04-10 20:50:00] Street of Porto | I thought that although I had known him for a long time, he had always been in my imagination, an imagination that had begun in my childhood, made up of all the wishes of those years, without any specific content, without a future. I knew that being with him forever was impossible.\n[1969-04-10 20:50:30] Street of Porto | I thought of Pietro as belonging to the present, solid and definite like a boundary stone. He had drawn for me a new territory, a realm full of reason.\n[1969-04-10 20:51:00] Street of Porto | I thought about the norms that existed in this field, rules coming from his family—that everything had to be given meaning, that great ideals had to be defended, principles upheld, and the family's reputation maintained.\n[1969-04-10 20:51:30] Street of Porto | I thought about how, on Pietro's estate, everything was taken for granted, such as marriage, which was a war between the worldly and the religious.\n[1969-04-10 20:52:00] Street 005 | I knew that Pietro's parents hadn't married in a church, just registered their marriage at the civil affairs office.\n[1969-04-10 20:52:30] Street 005 | I thought that, as far as I know, Pietro knows a lot about religion, and perhaps because of that, he wouldn't get married in a church.\n[1969-04-10 20:53:00] Street 005 | I thought maybe he really knew too much about religion, that he would rather give me up than marry me in a church.\n[1969-04-10 20:53:30] Street of Porto | I know the issue of baptism is the same. Pietro wasn't baptized, and neither was Mariarosa, so our children won't be baptized either.\n[1969-04-10 20:54:00] Street of Porto | I thought he was just like that, things would definitely turn out this way, as if someone were directing him.\n[1969-04-10 20:54:30] Street of Porto | I thought about how he didn't have God's support, but his family sustained him, and that was enough for him to be certain that he stood on the side of truth and justice.\n[1969-04-10 20:55:00] Street of Porto | I thought about sex, I didn't know his attitude, but I knew he was very careful.\n[1969-04-10 20:55:30] Street of Porto | I thought he knew very well about the things between me and Franco Mari, and he should be able to figure it out—I wasn't a virgin.\n[1969-04-10 20:56:00] Street of Porto | I saw that he never mentioned the subject, not even with the slightest joke, not a single roundabout comment, not even a word laced with jealousy.\n[1969-04-10 20:56:30] Street 005 | I thought to myself that he probably didn't have another girlfriend, and going to a prostitute was unimaginable. I also ruled out the possibility of him talking about women with other men.\n[1969-04-10 20:57:00] Street 005 | I know he really hates dirty jokes, and he also dislikes small talk, parties, shouting, and any form of waste.\n[1969-04-10 20:57:30] Street 005 | I knew that although his family was very wealthy, he still preferred a life of restraint. Once, this led to an argument with his parents and his sister.\n[1969-04-10 20:58:00] Street of Porto | I thought of him, of his strong sense of responsibility, of how he would never betray me or let me down.\n[1969-04-10 20:58:30] Street of Porto | Yes, I did. I didn't want to lose him.\n[1969-04-10 20:59:00] Street of Porto | I thought that although I had gone to school, my nature remained vulgar, far from his standards. If I couldn't be honest and proper like him, I could only accept my fate.\n[1969-04-10 20:59:30] Street of Porto | I thought that he would give me a chance to get rid of my father's despicable opportunism and my mother's rudeness.\n[1969-04-10 21:00:00] Street of Porto | I tried desperately to push Nino out of my mind, and I grabbed Pietro's arm, muttering. \"I heard, 'Yes, we should get married as soon as possible. I want to leave home early, I want to get a driver's license, I want to travel. I want a phone, a television. I've always had nothing.'\"\n[1969-04-10 21:00:30] Street of Porto | At that moment, he became happy, he laughed. I heard him say okay, and he agreed to everything I said.\n[1969-04-10 21:01:00] Street 005 | I saw him stop just a few steps away from the hotel, and he asked in a hoarse voice. \"I can sleep with you, can't I?\"",

    "text": "[1969-04-10 21:01:30] Street of Porto | I realized this was the final surprise of that night. I looked at him uneasily. I thought back to so many times before when I had suggested making love with him, but he always made excuses.\n[1969-04-10 21:02:00] Street of Porto | I thought about it, but in Porto, in this hotel, after the argument at the bookstore and my encounter with Nino, I felt I couldn't accept it.\n[1969-04-10 21:02:30] Street of Porto | I heard myself say, \"We've waited a long time, we can wait a little longer.\"\n[1969-04-10 21:03:00] At the entrance of the hotel | I saw myself doing it with him in a dark corner, at the threshold of the hotel. I watched him walk up Via Garibaldi, glancing back now and then, shyly waving at me.\n[1969-04-10 21:03:30] At the entrance of Mask Hotel | I saw his clumsy steps and the messy hair sticking up on his head. I suddenly felt very soft-hearted.\n[1969-04-11 20:00:00] at home | I remember, for example, that on the same evening I returned from Porto, I told my parents. I heard that Pietro wants to meet them, and we might get married within a year. After the wedding, we'll go live in Mergellina.\n[1969-04-11 20:00:30] at home | I saw that they didn't show any surprise, or rather, any happiness. I thought, they have already become completely accustomed to my coming and going freely. I have become a stranger in the house, and I never take any interest in the household matters.\n[1969-04-11 20:01:00] at home | I thought to myself that my father was a bit excited, which was normal—those issues he had never faced before always made him a little anxious.\n[1969-04-11 20:01:30] at home | I saw him impatiently asking. I heard, \"Is that university professor really coming to our house?\"\n[1969-04-11 20:02:00] at home | I saw my mother lose her temper. I heard myself say, \"If he doesn't come to our house, where else would he go? If he doesn't come here, how can he propose to Elena, how can he ask for your hand in marriage?\"\n[1969-04-11 20:02:30] at home | I saw her make her husband shut up. I know that usually, my mother remains calmer than my father when faced with problems. She is practical and decisive, sometimes even seeming a bit unfeeling.\n[1969-04-11 22:00:00] at home | I saw my father go to bed, and Elena, Peppe, and Gianni had set up their beds in the dining room.\n[1969-04-11 22:00:30] at home | I saw her start to scold me. Her eyes were red, and she stared at me, speaking slowly and clearly. I saw her voice was low, but it was shouted.\n[1969-04-11 22:01:00] at home | \"I heard you say, 'To you, we're nothing. You always inform us at the last minute. You went to school for a few days, wrote a book, and are about to marry a university professor, so you think you're special, that you've become a princess. But, my dear, you came out of this very belly, and that's your nature. Don't get so full of yourself. Never forget, if you're smart, it's because I gave birth to you. I'm just as smart as you, or maybe even smarter. If I had the same opportunities as you, I'd have done exactly the same thing, do you understand?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:01:30] at home | I saw her angry, and she started by saying it was because of me, because I had gone away to study, thinking only of my own affairs. My younger brothers were doing terribly in school, completely useless.\n[1969-04-11 22:02:00] at home | I saw and then she asked me for money, saying she needed it to buy a decent outfit for Elena and to tidy up the house, because I forced her to host my fiancé.\n[1969-04-11 22:02:30] at home | I saw that I hadn't paid attention to my younger brothers' grades at school, but I immediately gave her the money. I thought, although I knew those money wasn't meant for fixing the house, she kept asking me for money, and each reason she gave was good.\n[1969-04-11 22:03:00] at home | I thought that although she never said it outright, she still couldn't accept the fact that I was saving money in the post office, instead of handing over all the money I earned to her as I had before.\n[1969-04-11 22:03:30] at home | I know that before, I worked at the Mazzucchelli bookstore, or maybe I took the shopkeeper's daughter to the sea, and all the money I earned went to her.\n[1969-04-11 22:04:00] at home | I thought, maybe she felt that all my money belonged to her, that she wanted to convince me she belonged to me, even though I would get married, I would still belong to her forever.\n[1969-04-11 22:04:30] at home | I kept myself as calm as I could, just as we had agreed.\n[1969-04-11 22:05:00] at home | I heard myself telling her that I would install a telephone at home and buy a television for the house on installment.\n[1969-04-11 22:05:30] at home | I saw her looking at me as if she couldn't believe it, then suddenly she made an expression of great appreciation, speaking to me in the same tone as before. I heard, \"Installing a telephone and television at home?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:00] at home | I heard, \"Of course.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:05] at home | I heard, \"You're paying?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:10] at home | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:15] Borgo | I heard, \"You'll keep paying even after we get married?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:20] at home | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:25] at home | I heard her say, \"Does that professor know we don't have a penny in dowry and can't even afford to host a banquet?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:06:30] at home | I heard, \"He knows, we won't have a wedding banquet.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:07:00] at home | I saw her mood getting worse again. I saw her eyes turn red.\n[1969-04-11 22:07:30] at home | \"I heard, 'What, no wedding banquet? You can make him pay for it.'\"\n[1969-04-11 22:07:35] Borgo | I heard, \"No, we won't have a wedding banquet.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:08:00] at home | I saw my mother start to lose her temper again, and she cursed me with all sorts of words. I thought she wanted me to respond to her, to add fuel to the fire.\n[1969-04-11 22:08:30] at home | I heard, \"Do you remember Lina's wedding? Do you remember the wedding banquet?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:08:35] at home | I heard \"Remember.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:08:40] Borgo | I heard, \"You're much better than her, why don't you do it?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:08:45] at home | I heard \"Don't want to.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:09:00] at home | I saw that we have always communicated this way. I thought, in the end, it was better to let her vent her anger all at once rather than savor it slowly.\n[1969-04-11 22:09:30] at home | I said, \"Mom!\" I said, \"We're not having a wedding banquet, and we won't get married in a church either. We'll just get married at the civil affairs office of the city government.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:10:00] at home | As I thought about this, I felt as if a strong wind had blown, pushing the doors and windows open.\n[1969-04-11 22:10:30] at home | I saw her start to scream uncontrollably, her face red, her whole body leaning forward as she cursed in the most vile way. I know that although my mother was not religious at all.\n[1969-04-11 22:11:00] Borgo | I heard her shouting that without a priest, the marriage was invalid! She said, if I hadn't married in front of God, then I wasn't a wife, but a prostitute.\n[1969-04-11 22:11:30] at home | I saw her, despite her leg problems, rush like the wind to wake up my father and my brothers, telling them the thing she had been worried about all along—that I had studied for too many years and had ruined my mind.\n[1969-04-11 22:12:00] at home | I heard her shouting that I was so lucky, so successful, but I let others treat me like a prostitute. She said that having a daughter who didn't believe in God would be so shameful she couldn't even leave the house.\n[1969-04-11 22:12:30] at home | I saw my father come out in his underwear, looking confused. Several of my brothers and sisters wanted to find out what I had done and what trouble we were now facing.\n[1969-04-11 22:13:00] at home | I saw them trying to calm my mother down, but it didn't work. She screamed and shouted that she wanted me out of the house immediately. She didn't want to endure such humiliation. I heard her say she didn't want a daughter like Lina or Pinocchio, not even one with a formal marriage.\n[1969-04-11 22:13:30] at home | I saw it then, even though she didn't actually come over to slap me, just waving her hand in the air. I thought of her, but it seemed as if I were a shadow, and she was hitting a real me.\n[1969-04-11 22:14:00] at home | I saw her struggling hard to calm down, which was Elena's doing.\n[1969-04-11 22:14:30] at home | I saw my sister ask hesitantly. \"I heard, 'Is it you or your fiancé who wants to get married at the civil affairs office?'\"",

    "text": "[1969-04-11 22:15:00] Borgo | I saw myself explaining to her, actually wanting to clarify everything for everyone. I heard that it's been a long time since I went to the church. To me, whether getting married in the church or at the civil affairs office is the same.\n[1969-04-11 22:15:30] Borgo | I heard it, but for my fiancé, getting married at the Civil Affairs Bureau was very important. He understood all the issues related to religion; he thought religion was a sacred thing, but the church had interfered too much in state affairs and had become corrupted.\n[1969-04-11 22:16:00] at home | I heard myself say at last, in conclusion, that if we didn't get married at the civil affairs office, then he wouldn't marry me.\n[1969-04-11 22:16:30] Borgo | I saw that at this point, my father began to take my mother's side, but now he no longer joined in her complaints or scolded me.\n[1969-04-11 22:17:00] at home | I heard, \"He won't marry you?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:17:05] at home | I heard, \"No.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:17:10] at home | I heard, \"What will he do? Will he break up with you?\"\n[1969-04-11 22:17:15] at home | I heard, \"We won't get married, but we'll live together at Mergellina.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:17:30] Borgo | I realized this was the one thing my mother could not stand. She was absolutely furious. I heard her say that if I dared to do that, she would kill me with a knife.\n[1969-04-11 22:18:00] at home | I saw my father nervously running his hands through his hair, and he said to my mother. I heard, \"Just shut up for a moment and don't anger me. Let's talk calmly. We both know that those who get married in front of the priest and then have a big feast might end up with a really bad marriage.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:18:30] at home | I know this has always been a scandal for us, Mergellina. I thought he was referring to Lina.\n[1969-04-11 22:19:00] at home | I thought about how my mother had finally understood that the priest wasn't a guarantee, that in this ugly world of ours, there were no guarantees at all.\n[1969-04-11 22:19:30] Borgo | I saw that she stopped shouting and asked my father to assess the situation, then told me to obey.\n[1969-04-11 22:20:00] at home | I saw her limping around the house at that moment, shaking her head and cursing my future husband. \"I heard, 'What is he? A professor? Is he Communist Party? What a stupid professor! What kind of professor would think like that? Only an idiot would think that way!\"\n[1969-04-11 22:20:30] at home | I heard my father say, \"Not like that. This professor has only studied religious issues; he knows better than anyone the dirty things those priests have done. That's precisely why he wants to get married at the civil affairs office.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:21:00] at home | \"I heard, 'Well, you're right, many party members do it this way. So, your daughter is like unmarried, but I don't believe that university professor at all. If he really loved our daughter, I can't believe he would let Elena live with him like a prostitute, unmarried.\"\n[1969-04-11 22:21:30] at home | \"I heard, 'In any case, if we don't believe him, we should at least believe the city government— but I do believe him, even though I haven't met him yet. He's a very important man, the kind of man many girls want to marry. I work at the city government, and I can assure you that weddings held there are just as valid, if not more so, than those held in churches.'\"\n[1969-04-12 01:00:00] at home | I watched them talk like that for several more hours. Later, my younger brothers and sisters couldn't take it anymore and one by one went to sleep.\n[1969-04-12 01:00:30] at home | I saw myself comforting my parents, trying to convince them to accept this situation. I thought that feeling this was very important for me to enter Pietro's world.\n[1969-04-12 01:01:00] at home | I thought, in addition, through this way, I felt bolder than Lina.\n[1969-04-12 01:01:30] Borgo | I thought, especially, that if I met Nino again, I would hint to him: \"Look, what came of that argument between me and the religious teacher. Every choice has consequences. Often, our lives are squeezed into a corner, waiting for an opportunity, and that opportunity will eventually come.\"\n[1969-04-12 01:02:00] at home | I thought, but maybe I was exaggerating. In reality, things were simple. For at least ten years, the God of my childhood had already lost most of his influence over me. He was like an ailing old man, lying in a corner.\n[1969-04-12 01:02:30] at home | I thought I didn't need a sacred marriage at all. The most essential issue was: I had to leave San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1969-04-12 08:00:00] at home | I thought about how my family's fear that I was going to the civil affairs office to get married, instead of the church, wouldn't disappear in one night, but that fear gradually faded.\n[1969-04-12 08:00:30] at home | I saw that the next day, my mother was extremely angry with me, yet she didn't shout. I thought about it and felt as if everything she touched—the coffee pot, the glass with milk, the sugar bowl, a fresh slice of bread—would make her want to smash it right into my face.\n[1969-04-12 08:01:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her, but I ignored her. I left very early in the morning to handle the paperwork for installing a telephone at home.\n[1969-04-12 09:00:00] Alba Port | I finished quickly and then ran to the Albano port, where I wandered through the bookstores.\n[1969-04-12 09:00:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I thought about my determination to overcome my shyness when speaking in public, for example, the scene at Porto's bookstore.\n[1969-04-12 09:01:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I saw that I had blindly picked out some books and magazines based on pure instinct, spending a lot of money.\n[1969-04-12 09:01:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I saw that after much hesitation, I finally chose Freud's Three Essays on Sexuality, and I also bought two little pamphlets about sex. I know almost nothing about Freud, and the little bit of his theory that I do know is something I can't accept. I often find Nino's words echoing in my mind.\n[1969-04-12 09:02:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I know, just like when I used to read textbooks at school, prepare for exams, and write essays, it was also like how I had treated the newspaper that Galiani gave me, or the Marxist pamphlets Franco Mari gave me a few years ago. I thought about wanting to \"study\" the modern world.\n[1969-04-12 09:02:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I found it hard to explain, my understanding of the world during that time.\n[1969-04-12 09:03:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I know I've talked to Pasquale, to Nino. I've had some interest in what's been happening in Cuba and Latin America. I'm aware of the inescapable poverty of Mergellina, Lina's downfall, and the fact that the school expelled my two younger brothers because they weren't as diligent in their studies as I was.\n[1969-04-12 09:03:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I know I had long conversations with Franco Mari, and also an accidental meeting with Mariarosa. I think about it now, and I feel that all of this has been swallowed up in a white smoke (this world is extremely unfair and needs to be changed, but whether it's peaceful coexistence between the US and the Soviet Union, or the political reforms of the European labor parties, especially the Italian ones, they all tend to keep the proletariat in a state of waiting, keeping them in an auxiliary position, all of them are dousing the revolution, and the result is that the world gets stuck in a deadlock).\n[1969-04-12 09:04:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I thought that if the Social Democratic Party won, capitalism would rule the world, and the working class would also become part of consumerism.\n[1969-04-12 09:04:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I thought about these things, which stirred me up from time to time. I forced myself to update my knowledge, to keep up with current events. At first, my goal was simply to make an impression.\n[1969-04-12 09:05:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I have always believed that everything can be learned, including political passion.\n[1969-04-12 09:05:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I saw, while paying for these books, that my novel was placed on one of the shelves. I immediately turned my gaze elsewhere.\n[1969-04-12 09:06:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I saw, every time I looked in the bookstore window, my book displayed alongside the other newly published ones. I feel a mix of fear and pride, a strong sense of pleasure, but in the end, it always turns into anxiety.\n[1969-04-12 09:06:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I know, of course, that this novel was created by chance, written in twenty days, without much effort. I thought it was like a medicine that could ease my depression.\n[1969-04-12 09:07:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I know, of course. I know what great literature is. I spent a long time studying classical literature, and when I wrote this novel, I never once thought that I was creating something valuable. I thought about it, but I wanted to find a way to express it. Finally, this outburst of mine became a book—a book that contained something of myself.\n[1969-04-12 09:07:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I see it now, \"I\" is right there, I'm watching myself. I thought about how fast my heart was beating in my chest.\n[1969-04-12 09:08:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I thought not only in my books, but usually in those novels, I always feel something that excites me, like a bare, jumping heart. It's the same feeling I had back in the distant past when Lina suggested we write a story together.\n[1969-04-12 09:08:30] Alba Port Bookstore | I thought that this dream was later fulfilled by me. But was it what I really wanted? Writing, writing isn't something arbitrary. It has to be better than before, doesn't it?\n[1969-04-12 09:09:00] Alba Port Bookstore | I thought about the novels of the present and past, about understanding how novels are written, about learning, learning everything in this world, all for the sole purpose of shaping truly real souls. No one portrays them as accurately as I do, not even Lina, who wouldn't have been able to write so well even if she had the chance.",

    "text": "[1969-04-12 09:20:00] Cavour Square | I stopped for a moment on Cavour Square after leaving the bookstore. I saw that the weather was very good that day. I saw the colonnade on Via Fria, supported by steel columns, and it looked very solid, cleaner and neater than usual.\n[1969-04-12 09:25:00] Cavour Square | I read the newly bought book and newspaper very carefully, as I usually did.\n[1969-04-12 09:30:00] Cavour Square | I saw myself taking out my newly bought notebook from my pocket and jotting down some useful information. I thought I wanted to be a real writer, to focus on my own thoughts and observe them carefully.\n[1969-04-12 09:35:00] Cavour Square | I watched L'Unità from start to finish, taking notes on things I didn't know.\n[1969-04-12 09:40:00] Cavour Square | I saw an article by Pietro's father in the Bridge Newspaper, and out of curiosity, I read it carefully. I thought, but I felt it wasn't as important as Nino said, the article made me feel uncomfortable.\n[1969-04-12 09:40:30] Cavour Square | I thought of two reasons: first, the language used by Guido Airota-Pietro was harsher than the language used by the professor with thick glasses.\n[1969-04-12 09:41:00] Cavour Square | I know that later, there's a passage where he mentions some female college students. \"This is a new group,\" he wrote, \"obviously none of them are daughters of wealthy families. These girls wear simple clothes and have received a simple education. They hope to study hard so that in the future they won't have to just stay at home.\"\n[1969-04-12 09:41:30] Cavour Square | I thought he was implying me, he did it on purpose, or perhaps without thinking.\n[1969-04-12 09:42:00] Cavour Square | I noted this down in my journal as well (what was I to the Pietro family? A flower pinned on a button in their broad vision?), which was really disheartening. I became a bit annoyed and started flipping through Corriere della Sera.\n[1969-04-12 09:45:00] Cavour Square | I remember seeing it, the weather was mild, and I also remember—maybe it's invented, maybe it's real—the smell, the scent of fried pizza mixed with the smell of newspapers.\n[1969-04-12 09:45:30] Cavour Square | I watched myself flipping through the newspapers page by page. Later, I saw a headline that took my breath away, and there in the middle of four columns of dense type was a photo of me. I saw a small part of our Mergellina and Mercato in the background of the photo.\n[1969-04-12 09:46:00] Cavour Square | I knew the title of the article was \"A Girl Full of Ambition's Erotic Memoirs — The Debut Work of Elena Greco,\" and the signature at the bottom was indeed that man with thick-rimmed glasses.\n[1969-04-12 09:46:30] Cavour Square | I read the article and broke out in cold sweat, feeling like I was going to pass out.\n[1969-04-12 09:47:00] Cavour Square | I know my book is just an introduction for him; what he really wants to say is that in the past ten years, in every field of society, culture, and production—from factories to offices, universities, publishing houses, and the film industry—this generation of young people has no value whatsoever, they're a spoiled generation, and the entire world has fallen into chaos.\n[1969-04-12 09:47:30] Cavour Square | I know he sometimes quotes sentences from my novels, putting them in quotation marks, just to show: I represent this generation, I am a typical product of bad education.\n[1969-04-12 09:48:00] Garibaldi Square | I know that in the end, he defined me as a girl who used banal pornography to hide her lack of talent.\n[1969-04-12 09:48:30] Cavour Square | I saw myself crying. I thought about how, since the publication of that book, it was the harshest criticism I had ever seen—not in a local newspaper, but in one sold throughout Italy.\n[1969-04-12 09:49:00] Garibaldi Square | What tormented me most was the sight of my smiling face appearing in such an unforgiving article.\n[1969-04-12 10:30:00] On the way home | I saw myself walking home, and before going home, I threw away the newspaper. I thought about how scared I was that my mother would read the review and then use it against me.\n[1969-04-12 10:30:30] On the way home | I thought about how she would cut out that article and put it in her scrapbook, and every time I offended her, she would pull it out.\n[1969-04-12 11:00:00] at home | I saw that only my utensils were placed on the table. I know my father is at work, and my mother has gone to the neighbor's house, I don't know what she's going to get, and my younger brothers and sisters have already eaten.\n[1969-04-12 11:05:00] at home | After I put the noodles and potatoes into the pot, I started reading my book. I thought desperately: maybe this book really has no value at all, maybe they published it just to give Adele Airota a favor.\n[1969-04-12 11:10:00] at home | I wondered how I could have written such a bland sentence, expressed such an ordinary opinion? It's truly clumsy, so many useless quotation marks. I'll never write again!\n[1969-04-12 11:15:00] at home | I was so depressed I couldn't taste my food, and I kept looking at my book while eating.\n[1969-04-12 11:20:00] at home | I saw that Elena had returned and she gave me a note with a phone number from Signora Spagnuolo. I knew Mrs. Spagnuolo was very warm toward me, so I had those people who were urgently looking for me call her instead.\n[1969-04-12 11:20:30] at home | I knew the note said there were three of my numbers: one was Gina Metotti's, who handled the printing for the publisher, one was Adele Airota's, and the last was Pietro's.\n[1969-04-12 11:21:00] at home | I saw Mrs. Spagnuolo's handwriting was crooked. When I thought of those three names, I felt the idea that had just surfaced in my heart had become reality—the terrible things written by that man with thick glasses were spreading rapidly, becoming known to everyone within a single day.\n[1969-04-12 11:21:30] at home | I thought about how Pietro had seen it, and his family had seen it, and the publisher's editor had seen it. Maybe Nino had seen it too, and even my teacher at Borgo. Of course, it would also catch the attention of Teacher Galiani and her several children. Who knows, maybe Lina had seen it as well.\n[1969-04-12 11:22:00] at home | I saw myself suddenly start crying, which frightened Elena.\n[1969-04-12 11:22:30] Borgo | I heard, \"What's wrong? Elena?\"\n[1969-04-12 11:22:35] at home | \"I feel unwell.\"\n[1969-04-12 11:22:40] at home | I heard, \"Shall I brew you a cup of chamomile tea?\"\n[1969-04-12 11:22:45] at home | \"I heard 'Okay.'\"\n[1969-04-12 11:25:00] at home | I saw she hadn't even had time to make tea when someone knocked on the door—Mrs. Spagnuolo. She was very happy, a bit out of breath because she had climbed the stairs all the way up without stopping. I heard her say that my boyfriend called again, and he's still waiting on the other end of the line. His voice is really nice, with a nice northern accent.\n[1969-04-12 11:26:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I saw it and immediately ran downstairs to answer the phone, apologizing to her and saying I was sorry to disturb her.\n[1969-04-12 11:27:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I saw Pietro trying to comfort me. I heard him say that his mother had told him to tell me not to be sad, that the important thing was that someone was talking about the book.\n[1969-04-12 11:28:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | What surprised Mrs. Spenulo was that I, whom she had always thought to be a gentle girl, shouted into the microphone. I heard, \"If people talked about this book and said nothing but bad things, would you still remain indifferent?\"\n[1969-04-12 11:28:30] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard him tell me to calm down again, then he added, \"There will be an article on L'Unità tomorrow.\"\n[1969-04-12 11:29:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I saw myself coldly hanging up the phone. I heard myself say, \"It's best if no one pays any attention to me.\"",

Right in front of the newsstand, I started flipping through it. I knew it was a newsstand just a few steps away from my old elementary school.\n[1969-04-13 07:05:00] Street Newsstand | I saw my photo again, the same one that had been published on Corriere della Sera. I saw that this time the photo wasn't placed in the middle of the article, but at the very top, next to the title, which was: \"The Young Rebel and the Old Reactionary — On Elena Greco's New Book.\"\n[1969-04-13 07:10:00] Street Newsstand | I knew it was written by an author I had never heard of, but the person's writing was extremely good. I thought of his words, and they immediately began to heal me.\n[1969-04-13 07:15:00] Street newsstand | I saw him lavish praise on my novel and criticize the authoritative professor with thick glasses.\n[1969-04-13 08:00:00] at home | I saw myself returning home, and my heart felt better, even my mood had completely improved.\n[1969-04-13 08:30:00] at home | I saw myself flipping through my book. I thought again now and still found it beautifully written, harmonious.\n[1969-04-13 08:35:00] at home | I saw my mother speaking with a mocking expression. I heard, \"Did you win the lottery?\"\n[1969-04-13 08:40:00] at home | I saw myself placing the newspaper on the kitchen table, saying nothing.\n[1969-04-13 15:00:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I saw Mrs. Spagnuolo appear again in the afternoon; she said someone had called me. I heard her say, embarrassed and apologetic, that she was happy to be able to help a girl like me, then went on to praise me a lot.\n[1969-04-13 15:05:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I saw her sighing in the hallway. I heard that \"Giggia was unfortunate. When she was thirteen, her father made her work in the Solara's Capodimonte. It's a good thing she was engaged to Michele, otherwise she would have had to suffer for a lifetime.\"\n[1969-04-13 15:10:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I saw her open the door, walk through the corridor, and lead me to the phone hanging on the wall. I noticed that she had placed a chair in front of the phone, so I could sit comfortably while making the call.\n[1969-04-13 15:15:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I thought how much people respected those who had been to school, how everyone believed that those smart kids studied hard just to avoid a life of labor.\n[1969-04-13 15:15:30] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I thought to myself, how could I explain to this woman that since the age of six, I had become a slave to words and numbers, that my mood entirely depended on these combinations. This kind of pleasure was rare and unstable, perhaps lasting only an hour, an afternoon, or a night.\n[1969-04-13 15:16:00] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard \"Did you see it?\" Adele Airota asked me.\n[1969-04-13 15:16:05] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1969-04-13 15:16:10] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard, \"Are you happy?\"\n[1969-04-13 15:16:15] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1969-04-13 15:16:20] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard, \"I have some good news for you: your book is finally starting to sell. If it keeps going like this, we'll do a second printing.\"\n[1969-04-13 15:16:25] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | I heard \"What do you mean?\"\n[1969-04-13 15:16:30] Mrs. Spagnuolo's house | \"I heard that 'it means the friend on Corriere della Sera thought he could destroy us, but he actually did us a big favor. Goodbye, Elena, enjoy your success.\"\n[1969-04-18 10:00:00] at home | I knew that in the coming days, the book really took off. The most obvious sign was that Gina's phone calls became more frequent. She would tell me what the newspaper had said, or inform me which bookstores and cultural salons had invited me.\n[1969-04-18 10:00:30] at home | I saw that in the end, she would always enthusiastically say a word. I heard, \"The book is selling very well, Miss Greco. Congratulations.\" Thank you, I said. I thought about it, but I couldn't feel the slightest bit happy.\n[1969-04-18 10:01:00] at home | I thought to myself that the reviews appearing in the newspaper were shallow, all of them imitating the enthusiastic tone of the article on L'Unità, or following the formula of the piece on Corriere della Sera.\n[1969-04-18 10:01:30] at home | I know that even though Gina would repeat to me each time, negative reviews would also help the book sell. I thought about it, but it still hurt me deeply. I longed for approval to balance out the criticisms, which would make me feel a little better inside.\n[1969-04-18 10:02:00] at home | I saw that I no longer needed to hide my negative comments from my mother; I gave her all my comments, both good and bad.\n[1969-04-18 10:02:30] at home | I saw her frown as she tried to read a passage, but she never got past four or five lines. Either she would find something to argue with me about, or she would get annoyed and immediately put the article into her scrapbook. I knew it was something she was very passionate about.\n[1969-04-18 10:03:00] at home | I knew her goal was to fill up the entire collection. When I had nothing to give her, she would complain; she didn't want any blank spaces.\n[1969-04-18 10:03:30] at home | I know that during that time, the most painful comment appeared on Il Messaggero.\n[1969-04-18 10:04:00] at home | I know that the author is slavishly imitating the articles on Corriere della Sera, using a very exaggerated style. In the final section, he repeatedly emphasizes a theme: these women are losing control. Just look at Elena Greco's pornographic novels to see this—purely crude and vulgar leftovers of \"Bonjour Tristesse.\"\n[1969-04-18 10:04:30] at home | I know this article was written by Donato Nino, Nino's father. What hurt me most wasn't the comment itself, but the signature at the end of the article.\n[1969-04-18 10:05:00] at home | I thought back to when I was a child, how that man had deeply impressed me because he was the author of a poetry collection. When I found out that he wrote articles in the newspaper, to me he seemed to have a dazzling halo over his head.\n[1969-04-18 10:05:30] at home | I wondered why he wanted to write this review now. Did he want to take revenge on me, seeing his own reflection in the married man who harassed the female protagonist in the novel?\n[1969-04-18 10:06:00] at home | I wanted to call him and curse him in the dirtiest dialect, but in the end I gave up. I thought about Nino and discovered something important: his experience was very similar to mine.\n[1969-04-18 10:06:30] at home | I know we both refused to become like family: I had been trying to distance myself from my mother since childhood, and he had already cut off all ties with his father. I thought of this similarity, which brought me comfort, and my anger gradually faded.\n[1969-04-18 10:07:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I knew, but I didn't realize that in our Mergellina, Il Messaggero was the newspaper people read the most. I thought to myself that I had discovered it that very evening.\n[1969-04-18 20:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him standing at the threshold when I passed by his father's pharmacy in the evening. I know the pharmacist's son Gino, who has become a muscular young man from regularly lifting weights at the gym, even though he hasn't graduated yet, he's wearing a doctor's white coat.\n[1969-04-18 20:00:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him waving the newspaper and called my name in a rather serious tone, because he had already made some progress within the new Fascist Social Movement Party. I heard, \"Did you see what they wrote about you?\"\n[1969-04-18 20:01:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had to prevent him from getting his way, so I answered and then waved my hand, walking past him. I heard, \"They write too much.\"\n[1969-04-18 20:01:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him looking confused, muttering something, then said it with an obvious malice. I heard, \"I'd like to see your book. I know it's a very interesting one.\"\n[1969-04-19 10:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I realized that was just the beginning. The next day, as I was walking on the street, Michele approached me and asked me to have a cup of coffee.\n[1969-04-19 10:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw us enter his bar, and Giggia silently prepared coffee for us. I realized it was obvious—seeing me with her boyfriend clearly annoyed her.\n[1969-04-19 10:05:30] Capodimonte | At that moment, Michele said, \"Elena, Gino showed me an article saying you wrote an adult novel, which is banned for children under eighteen. Look at this, who could have imagined? This is what you learned at Borgo? This is what the university taught you? I can't even imagine.\"\n[1969-04-19 10:06:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"I think you and Lina have a secret agreement: she does those bad things, and you write them down. Is that right? Tell me the truth.\"\n[1969-04-19 10:06:30] Capodimonte | I saw my face turn red all at once, and before the coffee arrived, I said hello to Jiyao and left.\n[1969-04-19 10:07:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw him behind me, teasingly calling out to me. I heard, \"What's wrong, are you angry? Don't go, I was just joking.\"\n[1969-04-19 15:00:00] Capodimonte | I didn't have to wait long before I met Pinocchia Peluso. I knew my mother sent me to the new store in Karrachi to buy oil because it was cheaper there.\n[1969-04-19 15:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw that it was afternoon, and there were no other customers in the shop. Pinocchio said many flattering things about me. I heard you're really great! She muttered, it's an honor to be your friend, it's the only luck I've had in my whole life.\n[1969-04-19 15:05:30] Capodimonte | I heard her say at the end that she had read Nino's article because a supplier had left a Il Messaggero at the store. She said, Nino really isn't a good person.\n[1969-04-19 15:06:00] Capodimonte | I thought her anger was genuine.\n[1969-04-19 15:06:30] Capodimonte | I heard her say that her brother Pasquale had shown her an article from L'Unità, which was written very well and came with a beautiful photo. You're very beautiful, she said, everything you do is something people envy.\n[1969-04-19 15:07:00] Capodimonte | I heard from her that I would soon be marrying a university professor and moving to Mergellina, where I would live in a very luxurious house.\n[1969-04-19 15:07:30] Capodimonte | I heard she's also getting married, to a man who works at a gas station on the main road, but neither of them have any money, and it's not clear when it will happen.\n[1969-04-19 15:08:00] Capodimonte | I heard later that she suddenly started talking about Pinocchia, and she had a lot of complaints. After Pinocchia replaced Lina and started seeing Stefano, things got even worse. Pinocchia became arrogant in both Capodimontes, and she especially targeted her, accusing her of stealing and giving her orders, keeping an eye on her.\n[1969-04-19 15:08:30] Capodimonte | I heard that, so she could no longer stand it. She wanted to quit and work at her future husband's gas station.\n[1969-04-19 15:09:00] Capodimonte | I saw her speaking very seriously. I know I remember, before, Antonio wanted to marry me, and we also wanted to work at the gas station pumping gas for people.\n[1969-04-19 15:09:30] Capodimonte | I saw myself telling her about it. I thought I just wanted to cheer her up.\n[1969-04-19 15:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw her, and her face grew dark as she muttered. \"I heard, 'Yes, why not, you're pumping gas for people at the station! It's unimaginable, you're really lucky to have gotten out of this situation.\"\n[1969-04-19 15:10:30] Capodimonte | I heard her say some vague words at the end: \"The world is so unfair, Elena! So unfair! We all can't stand this situation anymore.\"\n[1969-04-19 15:11:00] Capodimonte | I saw her take out one of my books from the drawer as she was speaking, its cover already dirty and messed up. I saw that this was the first book of mine I had ever seen in Mergellina. What shocked me was that the first few pages had already turned dark and curled up, but the rest of the pages were still white and crisp.\n[1969-04-19 15:11:30] Capodimonte | \"I'll read a few pages at night,\" she said to me, \"or when there are no guests, but I've only gotten to page thirty-two so far, I don't have enough time, all the work is on me, the people from the Carracci family make me work from six in the morning until nine at night.\"\n[1969-04-19 15:12:00] Capodimonte | I saw later, and she suddenly asked me in a somewhat malicious way. \"I heard, 'How much longer do I have to read those really fiery passages?'\"\n[1969-04-19 15:12:30] Capodimonte | I thought of those provocative chapters.",

    "text": "[1969-04-19 15:30:00] Street | I saw, after a while, I met Pinocchia holding Maria, the daughter of Stefano. I found it hard to be polite to Pinocchio after she told me that dialogue.\n[1969-04-19 15:35:00] Street | I complimented her daughter a bit, saying that the child's clothes were very beautiful and the earrings were lovely too. I heard that Bambina was getting impatient. She told me about Antonio, saying they had started corresponding. In his letters, he said he had married and had children, but that wasn't true.\n[1969-04-19 15:36:00] Street | I heard her say that I had ruined Antonio's mind, and now he could no longer love anyone else.\n[1969-04-19 15:36:30] Street | I heard, and then she mentioned my novel. I didn't read it, she said first, but I heard that the book wasn't suitable to be kept at home.\n[1969-04-19 15:37:00] Street | I saw and then she said, apparently angry. \"I heard, 'What if the child grows up and sees the book? I'm sorry, I won't buy it.'\"\n[1969-04-19 15:37:30] Street | I saw that she added at the end. I heard, \"But I'm glad you can make money. Good luck.\"\n[1969-04-20 10:00:00] at home | I thought about how such things kept happening one after another, which made me doubt that the reason this book was so popular was because both the newspapers that were hostile to me and those that supported me pointed out that there was some bold sexual description in the book.\n[1969-04-20 10:00:30] at home | I thought to myself that maybe Nino mentioned Lina's issues with sex because he felt he could talk about such topics casually with someone who wrote similar things.\n[1969-04-20 10:01:00] Borgo | I thought that, in those circumstances, I really wanted to see Lina. I wondered if Lina might have also found a book to read, like Pinocchio.\n[1969-04-20 10:01:30] Borgo | I imagine: in the evening, after work at the factory, Enzo is alone in her room, while she has the child in another room. Even though she's completely exhausted, she still wants to read the book I wrote. She presses her lips together, frowns as she reads it, wearing that look she gets when she's completely focused on something.\n[1969-04-20 10:02:00] at home | I wondered what she would say about this book. Would she also think that it became popular only because of a few pages with overly explicit descriptions?\n[1969-04-20 10:02:30] at home | I thought, but maybe she didn't read this book. I suspect she couldn't afford to buy it. I should bring one to her.\n[1969-04-20 10:03:00] at home | I thought it was a good idea at first, but then I gave it up.\n[1969-04-20 10:03:30] at home | I thought again, and still, Lina was the most important person in my life, but I just couldn't bring myself to go find her. I didn't have time; I needed to learn a lot quickly.\n[1969-04-20 10:04:00] at home | I thought about it, and I remembered our last meeting: she was wearing an apron over her coat, standing in the factory courtyard, facing the fire, and she threw The Blue Fairy into the flames—that was her final farewell to childhood, and the path between us had grown increasingly distant.\n[1969-04-20 10:04:30] at home | I thought maybe she would tell me, \"Have you seen my life? I don't have time to read the book you wrote.\" I thought, I'll just continue on my own path.\n[1969-04-20 15:00:00] at home | I know that, for whatever reason, the book was really selling more and more.\n[1969-04-20 15:00:30] at home | I remember once when Adele Airota called me, still using that tone mixed with sarcasm and tenderness. I heard, \"If you keep going like this, you'll get rich. I wonder what you'll do with poor Pietro then.\"\n[1969-04-20 15:01:00] at home | I saw her hand the phone to her husband. She said, \"Guido Airota would like to say a few words to you.\"\n[1969-04-20 15:01:30] at home | I felt excited, and I had spoken to Professor Pietro very few times, which made me feel embarrassed.\n[1969-04-20 15:02:00] at home | I saw that Pietro's father was very polite; he congratulated me on my success and joked that those who criticized me were too conservative. I heard him mention Italy's long Middle Ages, praising my contribution to Italy's modernization, and other such things.\n[1969-04-20 15:02:30] Borgo | I knew he hadn't talked about anything specific regarding the novel; of course he hadn't read the book, he was very busy. I was happy that he, in any case, affirmed and appreciated me.\n[1969-04-20 15:30:00] at home | I saw Mariarosa also being very enthusiastic toward me, saying a lot of complimentary things. I heard her start by saying she wanted to talk about my book, but then she changed the subject and, speaking in an extremely excited tone, told me she wanted to invite me to Porto National University, where she thought I was absolutely necessary for the movement—the irresistible trend!\n[1969-04-20 15:30:30] at home | I heard you're leaving tomorrow,\" she encouraged me, \"have you seen what's happening in France?\"\n[1969-04-20 15:31:00] at home | I saw that I had been listening to the radio all along, a dirty, greasy blue radio that my mother had placed in the kitchen. I thought to myself, of course I know.\n[1969-04-20 15:31:30] at home | I heard myself say, \"I know, it's great!\" at the barricades in the Latin Quarter, at the University of Paris X.\n[1969-04-20 15:32:00] Chiaia | I heard she wanted to go to Paris with a few other companions, and she asked me to drive her. I thought about her, but she seemed to know even more than I did, and she was also involved.\n[1969-04-20 15:32:30] at home | I saw that I was a little excited. I heard myself say, \"Okay, I'll think about it.\"\n[1969-04-20 15:33:00] at home | I thought of going to Porto, then to France, arriving in Paris where student riots were raging. I wanted to throw myself into the hottest movement in recent months, facing brutal police.\n[1969-04-20 15:33:30] at home | I thought about going abroad, continuing the path I had taken years ago with Franco Mari.\n[1969-04-20 15:34:00] at home | I wish I could have left with Mariarosa! She was the only girl I'd ever known who was open-minded. Now, she could fully dedicate herself to the movement in the world, and like a man, she had already completely mastered the language of politics.\n[1969-04-20 15:34:30] at home | I thought about how I admired her, there was no other girl like her, brave enough to destroy the old world.\n[1969-04-20 15:35:00] at home | I thought of those young heroes—Rudi Dutschke, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. They risked their lives to face the violence of the counter-revolution, just like in war movies, where only men could do such things. Women could not imitate them; they could only love them, understand their thoughts, and suffer for their fate.\n[1969-04-20 15:35:30] at home | I thought that among Mariarosa's companions might be Nino, and they might know each other.\n[1969-04-20 15:36:00] at home | I think, meeting Nino and throwing myself into that movement with him, going on adventures with him—it's unimaginable.\n[1969-04-20 22:00:00] at home | I saw that the kitchen was very quiet, my parents were sleeping, and my two younger brothers were wandering outside. Elena was locked in the bathroom taking a shower. I knew that day had passed.\n[1969-04-20 22:00:30] at home | I thought about leaving, and I'll set out tomorrow morning.\n[1969-04-21 08:00:00] Mergellina | I saw myself leaving, but not for Paris. First, I was invited to the Normal School, and the female professor who invited me was a friend of a friend of the Pietros. I knew that after the turbulent political election of that year, Gina had me promote my book everywhere, starting with Mergellina.\n[1969-04-21 10:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I gave a lecture to thirty or so male and female students in the university, which was filled with an atmosphere of unrest.",

    "text": "[1969-04-21 10:30:00] Normal University | I saw many girls, even worse than what my grandfather wrote about in the newspaper: they dressed and acted in a vulgar way, became overly emotional when expressing themselves, spoke in a confused manner, were always angry about exams, and were dissatisfied with their teachers. I thought the first thing that surprised me was.\n[1969-04-21 11:00:00] Normal University | I spoke about the student movement and the events in France, guided by the professor. I felt very excited.\n[1969-04-21 11:15:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself showing off what I had learned. I thought I was quite satisfied with myself, I felt my expression was clear and full of confidence.\n[1969-04-21 11:30:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had spoken clearly. I thought that those girls really appreciated the way I spoke, the many things I knew, and my ability to explain the complex issues of the world.\n[1969-04-21 11:45:00] Normal University | I saw it, but I quickly realized that I tried to avoid mentioning my own book. Talking about my book made me very uncomfortable, and I preferred to summarize the ideas mentioned in the magazines \"Reading Joy\" or \"Monthly Review\" using my own language. I know, but I was invited to those places precisely in order to talk about my book. I thought about how scared I was of having a reaction like the one I had in our Mergellina.\n[1969-04-21 12:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw someone asking a question. I know that the initial questions always revolve around the female protagonist of the book, her efforts to escape from her environment of birth.\n[1969-04-21 12:15:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that only at the end, a girl asked me to explain why there was \"a passage of pornography\" in such an elegant and smooth novel. I remember she was very tall and thin, and her dialogue was often interrupted by a nervous laugh.\n[1969-04-21 12:15:30] Normal University | I rambled on about various social reasons, and finally I said that it was necessary to honestly portray all human experiences. I thought I was embarrassed, maybe I was blushing.\n[1969-04-21 12:16:00] Normal University | I said, emphasizing, everything including the unspeakable things, and those things we aren't even willing to admit to ourselves.\n[1969-04-21 12:20:00] Normal University | I saw that the last sentence won everyone's approval. I thought I had once again found my confidence.\n[1969-04-21 12:30:00] Normal University | I saw the professor who had invited me expressing his admiration for me. I heard that she will consider the issue and write to me.\n[1969-04-25 10:00:00] Other Bookstores/Salons | I sometimes speak in a humorous tone, sometimes in a tragic one, sometimes briefly, and sometimes I go on at length. I thought about her approval, which fixed the few ideas I had in my mind even more firmly, and soon they became the things I kept repeating.\n[1969-05-01 10:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw things that way, but in early May, before leaving San Gregorio Armeno for good, I decided to do one last thing: visit Professor Galiani, and that's when some unpleasant events occurred.\n[1969-05-01 10:05:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had found her phone, called her, and said that I was getting married, that I would be living in Mergellina, and that I wanted to visit her.\n[1969-05-01 10:06:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that she didn't show any surprise, nor was she happy, but rather polite. She told me to come see her at five o'clock the next afternoon before hanging up. I heard, \"Take your friend Lina, if she's willing to come.\"\n[1969-05-02 16:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw it happen, and Lina didn't hesitate at all—she handed Gennaro over to Enzo's care.\n[1969-05-02 16:30:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself made up, my hair styled, dressed according to the taste I had learned from Adele Airota.\n[1969-05-02 16:40:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself helping Lina, getting her properly dressed, because it was hard to convince her to look beautiful.\n[1969-05-02 16:45:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw she wanted to bring some snacks, so I said that wasn't appropriate—I had bought a copy of my own book. I thought, even though I was sure Teacher Galiani had already read it, I was doing this just to write a dedication for her.\n[1969-05-02 17:00:00] At Galiani's doorstep | I saw that we arrived at her house right on time and rang the doorbell. I saw a profound silence inside.\n[1969-05-02 17:01:00] At Galiani's front door | I saw us ring the doorbell again. Nadia opened the door, looking hurried and disheveled, not as polite as usual. I thought that not only had we disturbed her appearance, but also her upbringing.\n[1969-05-02 17:02:00] The Galiani Family's Home | I said that I had made an appointment with her mother, Nadezhda said. I heard, \"She's not here.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:03:00] The living room of the Galiani family | I saw her tell us to sit in the living room and wait, then she disappeared.\n[1969-05-02 17:05:00] Elena's living room | I saw that neither I nor Lina said anything; we just looked at each other awkwardly and smiled. I saw her in the silent living room.\n[1969-05-02 17:10:00] Elena's living room | I had been waiting for maybe five minutes when I finally heard footsteps in the hallway. Pasquale appeared, his hair a bit disheveled.\n[1969-05-02 17:10:10] The living room of the Galiani family | I shouted in great surprise, seeing that Lina showed no sign of astonishment at all. I heard, \"What are you doing here?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:10:20] Elena's living room | I saw him respond seriously and unceremoniously. I heard, \"What are you two doing here?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:10:30] Elena's living room | I realized I had to explain to him that I had made a meeting with my teacher, and I was coming to see her. I thought that sentence changed our situation at the time, as if it were his house.\n[1969-05-02 17:11:00] Elena's living room | \"I saw 'Ha!' he said, then shamelessly asked Lina, 'Are you better now?'\" \"About as good as ever,\" she replied. \"I'm glad.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:12:00] The living room of the Galiani family | I saw that I was angry, and I answered for her. I said, Lina is feeling a little better now. Either way, Soca was properly taught a lesson. The inspectors came, and the factory had to give Lina all the money she was owed.\n[1969-05-02 17:13:00] Elena's living room | \"I see,\" he said, at which point Nadia appeared, now neatly dressed, as if she were about to go out. \"I heard 'Do you understand, Nadia?' said Mrs. Greco, who gave Socalvo a good beating.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:13:30] Elena's living room | I saw myself and said loudly, \"It's not me.\" \"Not her either,\" Nadia smiled, \"it was a lesson from heaven for Soka.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:14:00] Elena's living room | I saw her walk across the room, and despite there being empty spots on the sofa, she made a graceful move and sat on Pasquale's lap. I thought I felt very uncomfortable.\n[1969-05-02 17:14:30] Elena's living room | I said, \"I just wanted to help Lina.\" Pasquale wrapped one arm around Nadezhda's waist and sighed at me. \"I heard, 'Good, that means in this world, in every corner of Italy, in all the factories, on all the construction sites, whenever a boss behaves badly and the workers are in danger, we call Elena Greco, she calls her friends, she calls the labor inspector, and tells the saints in heaven, and that's it, it's solved.'\"\n[1969-05-02 17:15:00] The living room of the Galiani family | I know he never spoke to me in such a tone, not even when I was still a little girl, when I thought he was very old and already a full-fledged political expert, did he ever treat me that way. I thought I had been offended.",

    "text": "[1969-05-02 17:15:30] Elena's living room | I was about to answer him, but Nadia interjected, pushing me aside. She spoke to Lina in that slow, sultry voice, as if there was nothing worth saying between her and me. \"I heard, 'Those labor inspectors are of no use, Lina. They went to the Sokolovo factory, they took notes, but then what? Everything stayed the same in the factory. The ones who spoke up got in trouble, and the quiet ones received a few lira as compensation. The police attacked us, and the Fascist members came downstairs and beat Nadia.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:16:00] Elena's living room | I saw she hadn't finished speaking, and Pasquale said to me in an even more resolute tone, raising his voice more than before. I heard, \"Tell us, you fucking bastard, what problem have you actually solved?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:16:30] Elena's living room | I saw the look on his face when he said those words, and it was filled with real pain, a genuine disappointment. I heard, \"Do you know what's going on in Italy now? Do you have any concept of class struggle?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:17:00] Elena's living room | I saw Nadia say, \"Please don't shout so much,\" and then she turned to Lina, almost whispering. \"I heard, 'You shouldn't leave your companion behind.'\"\n[1969-05-02 17:17:30] Elena's living room | I heard, \"No matter what, we're going to fail.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Inside, it's impossible to win by handing out flyers or fighting with Fascist.\" \"Then how do we win?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:18:00] Elena's living room | I saw Lina stop talking, and at that moment, Pasquale faced her, speaking slowly and clearly. I heard, \"Do we have to rely on the boss's good friend? Can't we just get some money without worrying about anyone else?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:18:30] Elena's living room | I couldn't help but say it, and in the same moment, I found myself raising my voice involuntarily. \"I heard, 'Pasquale, don't do this, what do you mean by saying these things? It's not like that.'\"\n[1969-05-02 17:19:00] Elena's living room | I thought, even though my mind was blank and I didn't know how to organize my words, I wanted to explain, to make him stop talking. The only sentence that kept coming to my lips, which was politically incorrect, was: \"Why are you doing this to me? Now that you can put your hands on this wealthy family's daughter, do you think you're something special?\"\n[1969-05-02 17:19:30] Elena's living room | I saw that, but at that moment, Lina stopped me with an unexpected and impatient remark, leaving me very confused, she said. I heard, \"Stop it! Elena, they're right.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:20:00] Elena's living room | I saw that, but at this moment, Teacher Galiani returned, and I could hear her footsteps echoing in the hallway. I thought I felt sad, were they right? I wanted to fight back, I wanted to get angry with her, what exactly was she trying to say?\n[1969-05-02 17:20:10] The living room of the Galiani family | I hoped that the teacher hadn't heard my cry, and I waited for Nadia to quickly get off Pasquale's lap and sit on the sofa. I also hoped to see the two of them feel embarrassed about their pretense. I noticed that Lina was also looking at them with a mocking expression.\n[1969-05-02 17:20:20] Elena's living room | I saw them, but they remained in their original position. Nadia had her arm around Pasquale's neck, as if afraid she might fall, and she said to her mother who had appeared at the door. I heard, \"Next time you have a guest, let me know in advance.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:20:30] Living Room of the Galiani Family | I saw the teacher ignoring her, just coldly saying to us. I heard, \"I'm sorry, I'm late. Let's go to my study.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:21:00] Elena's living room | I saw us following her in. Pasquale pushed Nadia aside a bit, and suddenly spoke in a tone that had become unexpectedly despondent. I heard, \"Come on, let's go over there.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:22:00] Corridor of the Galiani House | I saw Galiani leading us, and in the hallway, she muttered angrily under her breath. I heard, \"I hate rude behavior most.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:23:00] Galiani's Study | I saw and then she led us into a spacious room. I saw an old writing desk inside, with many books on it and some rather formal, upholstered chairs.\n[1969-05-02 17:24:00] Galiani's Study | I saw her speaking to us in a gentle and polite manner. I thought, but it was obvious that she was struggling with her bad mood.\n[1969-05-02 17:25:00] Elena's Study | I saw her say that she was happy to see me and Lina. I thought, yes, but I could sense her anger between the lines, and I hoped to leave as soon as possible.\n[1969-05-02 17:26:00] Elena's Study | I said, I apologized for not appearing for so long, and I spoke about the hardships of my studies, the book I had published, and all the things I had to deal with: the engagement, the upcoming wedding, and so on.\n[1969-05-02 17:27:00] Galiani's Study | I heard, \"Are you getting married in the church or at the civil affairs office?\" \"Just at the civil affairs office.\" \"Good.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:27:30] Galiani's Study | I saw her looking at Lina, wanting her to join our conversation. \"I heard that the wedding was held in the church?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you a believer?\" \"No.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:28:00] Galiani's Study | I heard, \"Then why did you get married in the church?\" \"Everyone does it that way.\" \"You shouldn't just follow what others do.\" \"A lot of people do it that way.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:28:30] Galiani's Study | I saw the question: \"Are you going to Elena's wedding?\" \"She didn't invite me,\" I immediately replied. \"That's not true.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:29:00] Galiani's Study | I saw Lina smirk and say. I heard, \"It's true, she's afraid I'll embarrass her.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:29:10] Galiani's Study | I knew she was speaking in jest. I kept thinking about it, but I was still hurt. What happened? Why did she say I was wrong in front of Nadia and Pasquale, and now she's saying such hateful things in front of the teacher?\n[1969-05-02 17:30:00] Galiani's Study | \"I don't believe it,\" I said. To calm myself down, I took out my novel from my bag and handed it to Professor Galiani, saying, \"I want to give this to you.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:31:00] Galiani's Study | I saw that she didn't look at the book properly, she thanked me, and she said. I heard, \"I already have one.\" I thought about my own matters.\n[1969-05-02 17:31:30] Galiani's Study | I saw it and then returned the book to me, asking me. I heard, \"What does your husband do?\" \"He teaches Latin literature at Mergellina.\" \"He's much older than you, isn't he?\" \"He's twenty-seven.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:32:00] Galiani's Study | I heard, \"So young, already holding a teaching position at the university?\" \"He's really good.\" \"What's his name?\" \"Pietro. Pietro.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:32:30] Galiani's Study | I saw Teacher Galiani examining me very carefully. I thought of how, back in school, she had asked me a question and my answer hadn't been comprehensive enough.\n[1969-05-02 17:33:00] Galiani's Study | I saw \"He's a relative of Guido Airota-Pietro?\" \"He's his son,\" she said, smiling, clearly with malice. \"I heard 'A very good marriage.' 'We love each other very much.'\"\n[1969-05-02 17:34:00] Galiani's Study | I heard, \"Have you already started writing another book?\" \"I'm working on it.\" \"I saw the article you wrote on L'Unità.\" \"Not much.\" \"I'm not writing there anymore, now it's just a bureaucratic newspaper.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:35:00] Galiani's Study | I saw her speaking to Lina again, as if trying every possible way to show her friendliness, and she said to Lina. I heard, \"What you do in the factory is amazing.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:35:30] Galiani's Study | I saw Lina make an annoyed face. \"I didn't do anything.\" \"That's not true.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:36:00] Galiani's Study | I saw Teacher Galiani stand up, riffled through the papers on the desk, and showed her a few pages. I thought it was irrefutable evidence.\n[1969-05-02 17:37:00] Galiani's Study | I heard that \"Nadia just randomly left the manuscripts at home, and I took a look. It's something full of courage, very original, and it's written well. I wanted to talk to you about it when I saw you.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:38:00] Galiani's Study | I saw that what she was holding in her hand was the few pages written by Lina. I know that based on these materials, I wrote my first article for L'Unità.\n[1969-05-02 17:50:00] The Galiani Family's Home | I thought, yes, I really should have pulled away. After leaving Teacher Galiani's house, I felt very bitter, and my mouth was dry.",

    "text": "[1969-05-02 17:51:00] Galiani Family | I thought about how I lacked the courage to tell my teacher that she shouldn't have treated me that way: even though she might have had the book I wrote a long time ago, she must have read it, at least roughly, and it was fine that she never mentioned my book at all, but she didn't even ask me to bring her the copy with my dedication.\n[1969-05-02 17:52:00] The Galiani Family's Home | I still left the book for her before leaving. I thought about it because of my cowardice, and also because I wanted to end the relationship in a gentle way.\n[1969-05-02 17:53:00] Galiani Family | I saw her neither say yes nor no; she smiled and continued talking to Lina.\n[1969-05-02 17:54:00] the Galiani family's home | I saw that, especially regarding my article, she didn't mention it at all. She only referred to it once in order to lead into a negative evaluation of L'Unità. I thought about how she took out the pages that Lina had written and started talking to Lina, as if my opinions on the subject were worthless, as if I wasn't even in the room anymore.\n[1969-05-02 17:55:00] The Galiani Family's Home | I thought of what I had wanted to shout at her: \"Yes, Lina is very smart, that's true, I've always known she was smart. I love her intelligence, it has influenced everything I've done. But I've achieved this through my own efforts. Everyone admires me. I'm not like your daughter, who's absolutely useless.\"\n[1969-05-02 17:56:00] The Galiani Family's Home | I watched but remained silent, I was there, listening to them discuss the work in the factory and the workers' demands.\n[1969-05-02 18:00:00] Stairs of the Galiani Family | I didn't stop until I reached the stairwell, and they were still talking there. In the end, Teacher Galiani casually greeted me, but she was still speaking to Lina.\n[1969-05-02 18:01:00] Stairs of the Galiani Family | I saw that they had already started calling each other \"you\": \"You should keep in touch with me often!\" Then they hugged her. I thought of it and it made me feel humiliated.\n[1969-05-02 18:02:00] Stairs of the Galiani Family | I knew Nadia and Pasquale never showed up again. I thought about how I'd never get the chance to vent the anger I'd been holding inside: was it wrong to help a friend? Hadn't I also put myself out there for her? How could they criticize what I'd done like that.\n[1969-05-02 18:05:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that finally, on the stairs, in the foyer, and on the sidewalk on Vittorio Emanuele street, only me and Lina were left.\n[1969-05-02 18:06:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought to myself, I was desperate to shout at her: \"Do you really think I'm afraid of bringing shame upon you? What's wrong with your mind? Why did you say those two people were right? You're truly heartless. I've done everything I could to help you, to be with you, and this is how you treat me? Your mind is really sick.\"\n[1969-05-02 18:07:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her, but as soon as we stepped outside, I hadn't even opened my mouth (if I had spoken, would anything have been different?), she took my arm and began defending me, talking about Galiani in a bad way.\n[1969-05-02 18:15:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I couldn't find any opportunity to blame her, whether it was about her supporting Pasquale and Nadia, or about not letting me attend my wedding. When it came to these matters, she now acted like another Lina, a Lina who clearly didn't know what had just happened, and trying to get her to explain was pointless.\n[1969-05-02 18:20:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I kept hearing her say that as we walked all the way to the Metro station at Piazza Amendola. \"I heard, 'What a bunch of rotten people. Look, how that old woman treated you. She wants revenge. She can't stand you writing books and articles. She can't stand you marrying well.'\"\n[1969-05-02 18:21:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard that what especially drove her crazy was that Nadia had been brought up to be superior to others, and she should have been a source of pride for her mother, but instead she was a complete failure. Not only that, but she was involved with a bricklayer, doing disgraceful things right under her mother's nose.\n[1969-05-02 18:22:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | \"I heard, 'Yes, Galiani couldn't stand it at all. You shouldn't feel bad about it, whatever she says. You shouldn't have left the book with her, you shouldn't have asked if she wanted it, you shouldn't have written a dedication. Those people, you should kick them in the ass. Your biggest flaw is that you're too kind. You listen to whatever they say.'\"\n[1969-05-02 18:23:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | \"I heard her say, 'Those who have been to school think they're the only ones with a brain, but that's not how it is. Just relax, go ahead, get married, go on your honeymoon. You've taken care of me for too long. Hurry up and write another novel. You know I expect you to live well and do something great. I love you.'\"\n[1969-05-02 18:25:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I was very shocked, I kept listening to her, being with her, I couldn't calm down at all. I thought about how every pause in our relationship would eventually bring about some unexpected situation, something that would throw her off balance and also me.\n[1969-05-02 18:26:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought, I didn't understand whether her words were an apology to me, or if she had said them on purpose to cover up her true feelings, not wanting to confess them to me, or perhaps wanting to say a final goodbye.\n[1969-05-02 18:27:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought, of course, she's hypocritical and has no conscience. As for me, even though my situation has changed, I'm still dependent on her. I feel that this dependence on her might never leave me for the rest of my life, and that makes me unbearable.\n[1969-05-02 18:28:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought to myself—I couldn't suppress my impulse—that the cardiologist's diagnosis was wrong, that Nadia was right, and I wished she were really dying.\n[1969-05-05 10:00:00] Spaccanapoli | One day, in a bookstore at Turin, I was talking about my book in a carefree tone, facing many readers. I thought I felt very at ease.\n[1969-05-05 10:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that even if someone asked about the sexual scenes on the beach in the book, using a passionate or provocative tone, I could now face it calmly. I already had a ready-made answer, and I would explain it so convincingly that people would accept it without question.\n[1969-05-05 11:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that at Turin, Professor Tarantano was accompanying me to the reader's meeting, which was also arranged by the publisher. I knew he was a close friend of Adele Airota, and he proudly said that he had really had the foresight to recognize the book's potential.\n[1969-05-05 11:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw him enthusiastically introducing me to the audience. I knew it was the same tone he had used at Porto a while ago.\n[1969-05-05 20:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw him at the end of the evening, when the reader's meeting ended, and he praised me, saying that I had made great progress in a short time. I heard it, and then he asked me in his usual kind tone: \"They say the sexual descriptions in the book are 'degrading chapters.' Why did you readily accept them? Why do you yourself also say such things to the public?\"\n[1969-05-05 20:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw him explaining to me that, first of all, my novel had other more interesting and exciting chapters besides the one on the beach. I heard that, and those descriptions that seemed a bit bold, in fact, many girls encounter while writing.\n[1969-05-05 20:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I heard him conclude by saying that pornography appears in many good literary works—the real art of storytelling—and sometimes it may cross the line, but it never becomes vulgar.\n[1969-05-05 20:15:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought my mind was a mess—this very cultured man was trying to tell me, in a roundabout way, that the \"sins\" in my novel were actually quite minor, forgivable things. Every time I explained them so dramatically, it was as if they were deadly, and I was wrong.\n[1969-05-05 20:15:30] Spaccanapoli | I thought, overall, I had exaggerated too much, I had catered to the public's short-sighted gaze.\n[1969-05-05 20:16:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought to myself: Now is enough. I don't want to act so servile, trying to please others. I need to learn to say no to my readers. I shouldn't let myself sink to their level.\n[1969-05-05 20:16:30] Spaccanapoli | I thought to myself that the next time I had the chance, I would respond to whoever asked questions about those pages in a more severe tone.\n[1969-05-05 21:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I saw that dinner was in a hotel restaurant, booked by the publisher for us. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I still listened with interest as Tarentano quoted literary works.",

I thought, and at the same time, I began to wonder: although this man praised me, he surely believed I had no real talent.\n[1969-05-05 21:20:30] Mask Loc 007 Hotel Restaurant | I thought that in his eyes, I was just a girl who had gotten lucky with success; even the chapters that were most attractive to readers probably didn't mean much to him, they could only impress those who didn't know much, but people like him, the intellectuals, wouldn't find them impressive at all.\n[1969-05-05 22:00:00] Mask Loc 007 Hotel Restaurant | I said that I was a bit tired, and I helped the person I had dinner with to stand up—he had had a bit too much to drink. I saw he was a short man with a big belly, looking like a food lover, his white hair fell in strands over his ears. His ears were large, his face was flushed, his nose was big, his lips were thin, and his eyes were lively. He smoked heavily, and his fingers were yellow.\n[1969-05-05 22:05:00] Hotel Elevator | I saw him trying to embrace me, to kiss me in the elevator, even though I struggled to push him away, he didn't give up.\n[1969-05-05 22:05:30] Albergheria | I thought about how I touched his stomach and the smell of alcohol on his breath, a feeling that had deeply imprinted itself in my mind.\n[1969-05-05 22:06:00] Hotel Elevator | I never thought that an old man, a friend of my future mother-in-law, who was so kind and cultured, would behave in such a way.\n[1969-05-05 22:07:00] Hotel Corridor | I saw that we had reached the corridor, and he quickly apologized to me. He hurried into his room and closed the door behind him. I heard him say that it was all the wine's fault.\n[1969-05-05 22:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that at this moment, Mariarosa, Juan, and Sylvia entered together. I saw them bring clean towels and pajamas.\n[1969-05-05 22:30:30] At Mariarosa's house | I thought Mariarosa certainly heard the last sentence, and she certainly understood that we were talking about my novel, but she said not a word.\n[1969-05-05 22:31:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought she could have said she liked the novel, that writing novels was possible anytime, but she didn't.\n[1969-05-05 22:31:30] Stazione Centrale | I thought to myself that although she appeared kind and warm towards me on the surface, in this culture completely swept up by political fervor, my book was probably seen as a trivial little thing.\n[1969-05-05 22:32:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought that some people might consider my book as the leftovers of some bolder, more audacious works—though I haven't read those books yet; or, as Franco Mari once said in a derogatory way, it's just a story about petty love and small passions.\n[1969-05-05 22:32:30] Spaccanapoli | I saw that at this moment my sister-in-law pointed me to the bathroom and my room. I thought she was polite, yet also hard to figure out.\n[1969-05-05 22:33:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I said goodnight to me and Franco Mari, and took the opportunity to say goodbye as well. I knew because he had to leave very early the next morning.\n[1969-05-05 22:33:30] Spaccanapoli | I saw that I had only shaken his hand, and he didn't seem to want to embrace me.\n[1969-05-05 22:34:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw him disappear into the same room with Mariarosa. I saw Juan's face grow dark, and Sylvia also became very unhappy. I thought to myself that I understood— the master of the house was going to sleep with the guest.\n[1969-05-05 22:35:00] Porto | I saw myself entering the room that had been prepared for me. I saw and smelled a very strong smell of smoke. There was a very messy little bed in the room, no bedside table or lamp, just the overhead light in the center of the ceiling.\n[1969-05-05 22:35:30] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I saw newspapers piled on the floor, along with a few magazines—*Mena Bo*, *New Mission*, *Marcatele*—and some very expensive art books, some of which were extremely worn, while others looked as if they had never been opened at all.\n[1969-05-05 22:36:00] Posillipo | I saw myself opening the window and placing the ashtray on the balcony. I saw an ashtray full of cigarette butts under the bed.\n[1969-05-05 22:36:30] Porto | I saw myself taking off my clothes and putting on the nightgown Mariarosa had given me. I saw that the dress was too long and too tight.\n[1969-05-05 22:37:00] Bathroom at Mariarosa's House | I saw myself walking barefoot through the dim corridor to the bathroom, and it didn't matter that I had no toothbrush. I know that when I was a child, no one taught me to brush my teeth. I started developing the habit of brushing my teeth when I was at Borgo Normal University.\n[1969-05-05 22:40:00] Porto | I saw myself lying in bed, trying desperately to erase the image of that Franco Mari from tonight out of my mind. I thought about the guy who loved me a few years ago. He was rich and generous. He helped me, bought me a lot of things, educated me, took me to political gatherings in Paris, and to Vesuvius, where we spent vacations at his parents' house.\n[1969-05-05 22:40:30] Porto | I think of him but I can't do it. My mind is full of this current Franco Mari, very provocative, shouting slogans in a crowded classroom, and the political slogans he shouted still echo in my mind.\n[1969-05-05 22:41:00] Porto | I thought about how he had belittled my book, dismissing it as insignificant, and now this Franco Mari had finally prevailed.\n[1969-05-05 22:41:30] Porto | Am I imagining my future as a novelist? he asked. There are other things to do besides writing novels. Was Franco Mari right? What impression did I leave on him?\n[1969-05-05 22:42:00] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I wondered what kind of memories he still kept about our past love, if he remembered it at all. Was he now complaining about me to Mariarosa, just as Nino had complained about Lina to me?\n[1969-05-05 22:42:30] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I saw myself getting up and turning off the light. I thought of it and immediately lost my confidence, feeling painful. I had imagined a sweet, perhaps slightly sorrowful evening, but in the end, I was deeply sad. I couldn't wait for the night to end so I could return to San Gregorio Armeno right away.\n[1969-05-05 22:45:00] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I lay in the dark, but I couldn't fall asleep. I kept turning over. I smelled someone else's body on the bed, a faintly familiar scent similar to the secret smell on my own bed at home, but I didn't know who had left it, and it made me feel slightly sick.\n[1969-05-05 23:00:00] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I saw myself lying flat on the bed again, and suddenly I woke up, realizing someone had entered the room. I whispered. I heard \"Who?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:00:30] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I saw it was Juan. He didn't beat around the bush, he was very urgent, as if he were asking me to do him a big favor. He spoke in a pleading voice. \"I heard, 'Can I sleep with you?'\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:00] Porto | I saw the request was so absurd that I immediately woke up. I wanted to figure out what was going on, so I asked. I heard \"sleeping?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:05] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I heard, \"Yes, I'm lying next to you, I won't bother you, I just don't want to be alone.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:10] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I heard, \"Absolutely not.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:15] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I heard \"Why?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:20] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I didn't know how to answer him, so I mumbled something. \"I'm engaged.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:25] Porto | \"I heard, 'What's the big deal? We were just sleeping.'\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:30] Porto | I heard, \"Go ahead, please, I don't really know you.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:35] Porto | I heard, \"I'm Juan. I showed you my work. What else do you want?\"",

    "text": "[1969-05-05 23:01:40] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I saw him sit down on the edge of the bed. I saw his black silhouette and caught the scent of cigar smoke in his breath.\n[1969-05-05 23:01:45] Porto | \"I beg you,\" I whispered, \"I'm tired.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:01:50] Porto | I heard, \"You are a female writer. You write about love. Everything that happens to you will inspire your imagination and help you create. Let me stay by your side; it will be something you can tell about in the future.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:02:00] Porto | I saw his fingertips brush my foot, and I immediately rushed to the switch and turned on the light. I thought I couldn't stand him anymore.\n[1969-05-05 23:02:10] Porto | I saw him still sitting on the bed, wearing only his underwear and a vest.\n[1969-05-05 23:02:20] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I said, \"Get out!\" I made it very clear to him. My tone was so decisive, I used all my strength, almost a shout, and I almost hit him.\n[1969-05-05 23:02:30] Porto | I saw him slowly getting up, and he said with obvious disdain. I heard, \"You're an old-fashioned person.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:03:00] Posillipo | I saw him leave, and I closed the door, but I couldn't lock it.\n[1969-05-05 23:03:30] Porto | I thought I was absolutely furious and also very scared, and many words from the San Gregorio Armeno dialect were churning in my mind.\n[1969-05-05 23:04:00] Porto | I saw that I had left the light on, and I waited a little longer before [intimate act]. I wonder what impression I leave on others? What kind of woman do I really look like?\n[1969-05-05 23:04:30] Porto | What made Juan make such a request? Was it the free-spirited woman in my book? Was it because of my political views?\n[1969-05-05 23:05:00] Porto | I thought about the words I had said—not just a game of argument to prove that I was as capable as men, but also that I could do whatever I wanted, even when it came to sex?\n[1969-05-05 23:05:30] Porto | I wondered if that was why he felt free to come into my room without hesitation—that he thought we were of the same kind? Or perhaps Mariarosa had brought Franco Mari into her room without any restraint at all?\n[1969-05-05 23:06:00] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | Was it because I had caught the feverish sexual energy of the university classroom, and I myself was exuding that same energy without realizing it?\n[1969-05-05 23:06:30] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I know it was also at Porto last time. I had already made peace with betraying Pietro. I wanted to be intimate with Nino, but that kind of passion had already existed for a long time — it could explain my desire and my betrayal. I thought about it, but the very idea of sex, the direct demand of the body, was something I couldn't accept. I was completely unprepared and felt sick.\n[1969-05-05 23:07:00] Porto | I thought about Turin, why did I let Adele Airota's friend touch me? Why did I let Juan touch me in this house? What did I show? What did they want to show?\n[1969-05-05 23:07:30] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I know that the memory of my time with Donato Nino on the beach in Ischia isn't about what happened that night on the beach and later became part of a novel's plot, but rather about the moment he appeared in Nella's kitchen.\n[1969-05-05 23:08:00] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I know that at the time, he had [intimate contact] with me, and he [intimate contact] me, and he touched me, making me feel a pleasure that went against my will.\n[1969-05-05 23:08:30] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | Did I think about the connection between that terrified girl and the woman now being harassed in the elevator, invaded by a stranger in her room?\n[1969-05-05 23:09:00] Guest Room at Mariarosa's House | I thought of Adele Airota's friends—the cultured Tarantano, the Venezuelan painter Juan—were they all of the same sort as Nino's father, that train conductor, small-time poet, and hired writer?\n[1969-05-05 23:30:00] Porto | I saw my nervousness, I couldn't sleep, my mind was full of conflicts.\n[1969-05-05 23:30:30] Porto | I saw that just at this moment, Milko started crying again, his sobs would not subside. I thought of this, which stirred up the intense emotion I had felt when I held him in my arms.\n[1969-05-05 23:31:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw that I couldn't control myself anymore, so I got up and followed the sound of the child's crying to a door. I saw light coming through the slightly open door.\n[1969-05-05 23:31:30] Sylvia's Room | I shouted, and Sylvia answered me in a bad mood.\n[1969-05-05 23:32:00] Sylvia's Room | I saw that room was a bit more comfortable than the one I was staying in, with an old wardrobe, a nightstand, and a double bed.\n[1969-05-05 23:32:30] Sylvia's Room | I saw the young mother sitting cross-legged on the bed, wearing a pink short nightgown, with a fierce expression on her face. I know she had her hands spread out, the backs of her hands resting on her bare thighs, like a gesture of making a wish.\n[1969-05-05 23:33:00] Sylvia's Room | I saw Mirko naked, his mouth wide open, crying so hard his whole body turned purple. His eyes were tightly shut, and his limbs were trembling.\n[1969-05-05 23:33:30] Sylvia's Room | I saw that at first, Sylvia was hostile toward me, but later her tone softened. I heard her say that she didn't think she was a good mother, that she didn't know what to do, and that she was too desperate.\n[1969-05-05 23:34:00] Sylvia's Room | I heard her say in a low voice, \"He's always like this when he's not drinking milk. Maybe he's sick and will die in this bed.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:34:30] Sylvia's Room | I got to the end, and she started crying. I thought about the way she spoke, and it made me feel that she was nothing like Lina at all. She had become ugly, her eyes wide and staring, her mouth twitching nervously, ruining her beauty.\n[1969-05-05 23:35:00] Sylvia's Room | I heard the child's crying and the mother's sobs, which made me very soft-hearted. I wanted to embrace them and take care of them.\n[1969-05-05 23:35:30] Sylvia's room | I said in a low voice, \"Can I hold him?\" She nodded, her voice trembling with sobs.\n[1969-05-05 23:36:00] Silvia's Room | I saw myself taking the child from her lap and holding him against my chest. I thought again about that exchange of scent, sound, and warmth, just like the last time I held him. His vitality once again stirred me, bringing me joy.\n[1969-05-05 23:36:30] Sylvia's Room | I saw myself pacing around the room, softly humming a lullaby I had improvised, a long, meaningless declaration of love.\n[1969-05-05 23:37:00] Sylvia's Room | I saw Mirko calm down miraculously and finally fall asleep.\n[1969-05-05 23:37:30] Sylvia's Room | I saw myself gently placing him beside his mother, but I didn't want to leave him. I thought about how I was afraid to return to my own room, and my subconscious told me that Juan was surely waiting for me there.\n[1969-05-05 23:38:00] Sylvia's Room | I saw Sylvia thanking me, but there was no real gratitude in her tone. After hearing that thank you, she then listed a cold, detached list of my virtues: \"You're smart, you know everything, you can make people respect you. You are a real mother, and your children in the future will be very lucky.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:38:30] Sylvia's Room | I said I had to leave, trying to be polite. But suddenly she looked uneasy. She took my hand and begged me to stay. I heard he can feel you, she said. Stay with him, so he'll sleep more peacefully.\n[1969-05-05 23:39:00] Sylvia's Room | I saw that I immediately accepted it, we lay in bed with the child in the middle, turned off the light, but we didn't sleep. We began to tell each other our stories.\n[1969-05-05 23:45:00] Sylvia's Room | I saw her, and she told me about the hatred she felt when she discovered she was pregnant. I saw that in the dark, Sylvia had become less difficult to get along with.\n[1969-05-05 23:45:30] Sylvia's Room | I know that on one hand, she kept secret from the man she deeply loved that she was pregnant, and on the other hand, she also deceived herself, believing it was like an illness that would pass. But her body began to react, gradually changing.\n[1969-05-05 23:46:00] Sylvia's Room | I knew Sylvia had to tell her parents about it. She came from a very wealthy family in Monza, and after a big argument with her family, she ran away from home.\n[1969-05-05 23:46:30] Sylvia's Room | I know that in the first few months, she hoped for a miracle. She had never considered an abortion, not even out of fear for her body.",

    "text": "[1969-05-05 23:47:00] Silvia's Room | I saw her begin to think that, out of love for the man who had made her pregnant, she would have the child. I heard him tell Sylvia, \"If you're going to have a child, out of love for you, I want this child too.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:47:30] Sylvia's Room | I saw the two of them start talking seriously. I know about love and affection, I love you, you love me. But after a few months, when the child still hadn't come, their love had already faded.\n[1969-05-05 23:48:00] Sylvia's Room | I knew Sylvia was in great pain, and she kept begging him to stay. In the end, all that remained between them was resentment.\n[1969-05-05 23:48:30] Sylvia's Room | I saw her give birth alone, and she was able to do it all thanks to Mariarosa.\n[1969-05-05 23:49:00] Sylvia's Room | I heard her speaking very enthusiastically about Mariarosa. I heard, \"She's a really great teacher, truly on the students' side, and an unparalleled Communist Party member.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:49:30] Sylvia's Room | I told her that the entire Pietro family was admirable, that I was Pietro's fiancée, and that we would get married in the fall. I heard her say, \"Marriage and family scare me—they're all just clichés.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:00] Sylvia's Room | I heard her suddenly say in a sad tone, \"Milko's father also teaches at the university.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:05] Sylvia's Room | I heard \"Is that so?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:10] Sylvia's Room | I heard him say, \"Everything started when I took his class. He was very confident, smart, knowledgeable, and handsome. He had many great qualities. Before the students even began to fight, he said, 'You must reform your professors, don't let them treat you like animals.'\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:15] Silvia's Room | I heard, \"Did he take care of the children?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:20] Sylvia's Room | I saw her smile in the darkness, a bitter smile. I heard myself say, \"A man, except for those crazy moments—when you love him, when he enters you—otherwise he's always outside of you. That is, later you don't love him anymore, and when you think about how you once wanted him, it makes you uncomfortable. I liked him, he liked me, the thing is over. I might fall for someone every day, don't you? This kind of liking lasts for a while, then it passes, only the child remains, he is part of you. The father of the child is always an outsider, first an outsider, then still an outsider. Even his name sounds different now. I used to call him Nino. Every morning when I woke up, that name would repeat in my mind, it was a magical word, but now it's a sad one.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:50] Sylvia's Room | I stayed silent for a while, and finally asked in a low voice. I heard, \"Does Mirko's father's name is Nino?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:50:55] Sylvia's Room | I heard, \"Yes, everyone knows him, he's very famous at the university.\"\n[1969-05-05 23:51:00] Sylvia's Room | I heard, \"What's Nino's last name?\"\n[1969-05-05 23:51:05] Sylvia's Room | I heard \"Nino. Nino.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I left early in the morning, without waking Sylvia or the child sleeping in her arms, and I didn't see the painter.\n[1969-05-06 06:10:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I only greeted Mariarosa, because she got up very early to take Franco Mari to the train station. I know she has just returned home, and she looks very tired. I thought I felt very uncomfortable.\n[1969-05-06 06:10:30] Stazione Centrale | I heard her ask, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n[1969-05-06 06:10:35] Spaccanapoli | I heard, \"I talked with Sylvia for a long time.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:10:40] Stazione Centrale | I heard, \"She told you about Nino.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:10:45] Stazione Centrale | I heard \"Yes.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:10:50] Stazione Centrale | I heard, \"I know you're friends.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:10:55] Stazione Centrale | \"I heard, 'It's him who told you?'\"\n[1969-05-06 06:11:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"Yes, we've talked about you.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:11:05] At Mariarosa's house | I heard, \"Miro is really his child?\"\n[1969-05-06 06:11:10] San Gregorio Armeno | \"I see,\" she yawned, then smiled. I heard her say, \"Nino is charming, all the girls are fighting to be with him. This is a happy time, you can be with whoever you want. He always has this energy that makes people feel good, really exciting.\"\n[1969-05-06 06:11:40] Spaccanapoli | I heard her say that in this movement, we very much needed people like him, but we had to take care of him, guide him, and help him grow.\n[1969-05-06 06:12:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard he's a very capable man, she said, but he needs to lead; in his heart, there's always some leftover of bourgeois democracy, of company technicians, of modernists.\n[1969-05-06 06:30:00] Porto | When I finished reading, we felt that the time we had spent together was too short. Both of us were sorry and vowed that next time we would stay longer.\n[1969-05-06 07:00:00] Porto | I saw myself taking the luggage from the hotel and then leaving.\n[1969-05-06 10:00:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I knew that only on the train, during the long journey back to San Gregorio Armeno, did I begin to accept that Nino was becoming a father again. I thought of a dull grayish white, spreading from Sylvia to Lina, from Mirko to Gennaro.\n[1969-05-06 10:00:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I know the passion of Ischia, the loving nights of Mergellina, the infidelity on Piazza Martiri. I thought to myself that everything had lost its color, becoming a mechanical reaction.\n[1969-05-06 10:01:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I know that Nino left San Gregorio Armeno, and is now passionately involved with Sylvia. Who knows if he has other women as well. I get angry thinking about it, as if Lina is hiding in some corner of my mind, and I feel exactly what she feels.\n[1969-05-06 10:01:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I felt a bitter resentment, just as she might have felt when she heard the news, and I was also very angry, as if Nino had done something wrong to me.\n[1969-05-06 10:02:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about Nino betraying us—Lina and I were both suffering the same humiliation, we both loved him, but he had never truly loved either of us.\n[1969-05-06 10:02:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought, therefore, that despite his many good qualities, he was ultimately a frivolous man, shallow like an animal, sweating and excreting bodily fluids, leaving behind living creatures nurtured in the bellies of women after careless pleasures.\n[1969-05-06 10:03:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I know I remember, a few years ago when he came to Mergellina to see me, we were talking in the courtyard, and Melina saw him through the window, mistaking him for his father.\n[1969-05-06 10:03:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I knew that Donato's previous lovers had noticed the similarity, but I hadn't. I realized now that Melina was right and I was wrong.\n[1969-05-06 10:04:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about Nino cutting off relations with his father, not because he was afraid of becoming like him, but because Nino was already like his father now, he just didn't want to admit it.\n[1969-05-06 10:04:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him, but I still couldn't hate him. On the steamy train, I didn't just think of the moment I saw him in the Porto bookstore—I wove him into everything that happened during those days, into every word that was said.\n[1969-05-06 10:05:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I found myself thinking about sex all the time—dirty, tempting sex, everywhere in actions, words, and books.\n[1969-05-06 10:05:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought of the high walls that separated men and women were collapsing, and the bonds of upbringing were also breaking apart.\n[1969-05-06 10:06:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought of Nino, who was immersed in this era, part of the noisy student assembly at Porto University. He fit perfectly into that atmosphere, as well as into the chaos of Mariarosa's home; they must have been together once.\n[1969-05-06 10:06:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that, with his intelligence, desires, and ability to seduce, he would live in that era with curiosity and great confidence.\n[1969-05-06 10:07:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought maybe I was wrong, and I shouldn't have assumed he was as dirty and vulgar as his father. His actions belonged to another culture.\n[1969-05-06 10:07:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I know that both Silvia and Mariarosa emphasized this: the girls all wanted him, and he simply accepted their advances. There was no oppression, no right or wrong—only desire was in control.\n[1969-05-06 10:08:00] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that maybe when Nino told me that Lina had problems with sex, he was trying to tell me that the era of expectations had ended, that it was wrong and distorted to mix responsibility with pleasure.\n[1969-05-06 10:08:30] On the train back to San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that if he was like his father, his obsession with women would be another version of it.",

    "text": "[1969-05-06 11:30:00] Mercato | When I arrived at San Gregorio Armeno, I felt a bit surprised and, at the same time, repelled by the thought that Nino was loved by so many people, and he loved so many people too.\n[1969-05-06 11:30:30] Mercato | I thought to myself: What's wrong with admitting it? He was enjoying life, just like those who know how to enjoy it.\n[1969-05-06 12:00:00] at home | I thought about when I returned to Mergellina, and I realized why all the women wanted him and why he readily accepted them. I had always wanted him, but now my desire was even stronger. I decided to try my best not to meet him again.\n[1969-05-06 12:00:30] at home | I didn't know what to do about Lina. Should I tell her what I knew, or not? I'd wait until I saw her.\n[1969-05-06 13:00:00] at home | I saw that upon returning home, I had no time and didn't want to think about it anymore.\n[1969-05-06 13:30:00] at home | I saw Pietro calling me, and he announced that he would visit my parents next week.\n[1969-05-06 13:30:30] at home | I thought about how I had accepted this reality, like accepting an unavoidable disaster.\n[1969-05-07 10:00:00] at home | I saw that I had to quickly find him a hotel, I cleaned the room, did the family's ideological work, telling them not to worry, but none of it helped. My situation was getting worse and worse.\n[1969-05-08 10:00:00] at home | I know that in our Mergellina, there's been more and more gossip about my book, about me personally, and about the fact that I often travel alone.\n[1969-05-08 10:30:00] Borgo | I saw my mother defending me, boasting that I was about to get married. I heard her say that my decision not to get married in the church only made things worse, that I wasn't getting married in San Gregorio Armeno, but instead in Genoa, which led to even more gossip, and that really angered her.\n[1969-05-08 20:00:00] at home | I saw that one night, she was very brutal with me. I heard her say that people who read my book thought the content was embarrassing, and they all talked behind my back.\n[1969-05-08 20:10:00] at home | I saw my brothers shouting at me too, saying they had to fight with the butcher's son because he called me a whore. Not only that, but they also had to beat up Elisa's classmate because the guy made Elisa do the same things her sister did.\n[1969-05-08 20:15:00] at home | I heard my mother hissing at me, \"What did you write?\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:05] at home | I heard, \"Nothing, Mom!\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:10] at home | I heard, \"Did you write about all those disgusting things you did when you were out?\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:15] at home | I heard, \"What kind of dirty business it is, you go and see for yourself.\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:20] at home | I heard, \"I don't want to waste my time on those stupid things you write.\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:25] at home | I heard, \"Then just let me go.\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:30] Borgo | I heard, \"If your father knew what people were saying about you, he'd throw you out of the house.\"\n[1969-05-08 20:15:35] at home | I heard, \"No need, I can walk by myself.\"\n[1969-05-08 21:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I went out in the evening, leaving home to clear my mind, just so I wouldn't say things to my mother that would make me regret later.\n[1969-05-08 21:10:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about on the road, in the park, along the main road—I felt everyone's eyes were fixed on me, a world I was about to leave, angry at me.\n[1969-05-08 21:30:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her later when I met Giugliara, who had just gotten off work. We lived in the same building, and we walked back together.\n[1969-05-08 21:35:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I knew I was worried that she would eventually say something to annoy me, as her usual personality was either stubborn or sly. I thought, but what surprised me was that she timidly said to me.\n[1969-05-08 21:35:05] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"I read the book you wrote, it's great! It's so brave of you to write those things.\"\n[1969-05-08 21:35:10] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I was a bit stunned. \"I heard, 'What thing?'\"\n[1969-05-08 21:35:15] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"That's what you did on the beach.\"\n[1969-05-08 21:35:20] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"It wasn't me, it was the characters in the book.\"\n[1969-05-08 21:35:25] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | At that moment, she took my hand, and I had to stop. She whispered. I heard, \"Yes, but you wrote it so well, Elena, just like it really happened, so dirty! This is a secret only a woman would know.\"\n[1969-05-08 21:35:50] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | \"I heard 'You tell Lina, if you see her, tell her she did the right thing, I support her. She got rid of her husband, mom, dad, brother, Marcello, Michele, and all the other crap, and she did well. I should also run away from here, but I'm not as smart as the two of you. I was born stupid, there's nothing I can do.'\"\n[1969-05-08 21:40:00] Apartment Building San Gregorio Armeno | I stopped on the floor where I lived, and she went back to her house, but the words she said kept echoing in my mind.\n[1969-05-08 21:40:30] via Toledo | I thought what shocked me was that she talked about my success and Lina's downfall together, and to her, both were equally exciting.\n[1969-05-08 21:41:00] via Toledo | I thought of some other words that were deeply etched in my mind: the disgusting things I described in my book made her feel exactly as I did, which was a new experience for me, and I couldn't make a judgment about it.\n[1969-05-08 21:41:30] at home | I didn't think about it anymore when Pietro came later.\n[1969-05-13 14:00:00] Train Station San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself going to the train station to meet him, accompanying him all the way to Mercato, where there was a hotel, recommended by my father, and I had booked a room there.\n[1969-05-13 14:10:00] Train Station San Gregorio Armeno | I saw Pietro looking more nervous than my family. He got off the train, dragging a big suitcase, as usual unkempt. I saw that because of the heat, his face was red and full of exhaustion.\n[1969-05-13 14:20:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw him wanting to buy a bouquet of flowers for my mother, and he bought a large, fairly expensive bouquet. I thought this was different from his usual habits, but he was satisfied.\n[1969-05-13 15:00:00] Porto | I saw that we had arrived at the hotel, and he told me to stay in the lobby alone with the flowers. I heard him promise that he would be back right away.\n[1969-05-13 15:30:00] Porto | I had been watching for half an hour when he appeared. I saw him wearing a blue suit, a white shirt, a sky-blue tie, and his shoes were polished to a shine.\n[1969-05-13 15:30:30] Porto | I saw myself laughing instantly. I heard him ask me, \"Do I look bad?\"\n[1969-05-13 15:30:35] Porto | I saw that I had made him feel at ease; his clothes were very good.\n[1969-05-13 16:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw it, but on the way, I could feel the eyes of the men around me, and their mocking laughter. I thought, as if I were walking alone, perhaps they wanted to imply and emphasize that the person accompanying me was not worth respecting.\n[1969-05-13 16:00:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw Pietro holding a large bouquet of flowers. He wouldn't let me hold them; every detail of his was so proper. I thought of a city that wasn't suitable for me.\n[1969-05-13 16:01:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that his empty arm was resting on my shoulder. I thought, but I felt, I should protect him.",

    "text": "[1969-05-13 16:30:00] at home | I saw Elena opening the door for us, then my father came out, followed by my brothers. I saw that everyone was dressed in festival clothes, and everyone was being too polite.\n[1969-05-13 16:35:00] at home | I saw my mother was the last one to appear. After the sound of the toilet flushing, I heard her limping over. I saw her get her hair done and put some color on her lips and cheeks. I thought to myself, she had once been a beautiful girl.\n[1969-05-13 16:40:00] at home | I saw her politely take the flowers, and we sat together in the restaurant. I knew that, in order to entertain guests, they had hidden the beds that were set up in the evening and taken down in the morning.\n[1969-05-13 16:45:00] at home | I saw everything was very clean, and the tableware on the table was arranged with great care. I knew my mother had been preparing with Elena for several days, which made the dinner last endlessly.\n[1969-05-13 17:00:00] at home | I was shocked to see Pietro because he suddenly became very cheerful.\n[1969-05-13 17:10:00] at home | I saw him asking about my father's job at the city hall. My father spoke Italian awkwardly, so Pietro had my father speak in the local dialect. I knew my father had told him some amusing stories about city government employees, and although my fiancé didn't understand them very well, he showed great appreciation for those stories.\n[1969-05-13 17:30:00] at home | I saw, especially, that I had never seen him eat so much. Every time a dish was brought out, he would compliment my mother and sister, and he would ask about the method of each dish, as if he were about to cook them himself. I know, but as far as I know, he can't even boil an egg himself.\n[1969-05-13 17:40:00] at home | I saw that his favorite dish was the potato cake. After he finished, my mother added another portion to his plate, and it was generously sized. I heard her say, in that distinctive tone of hers, devoid of any emotion, that she would make the potato cake again before he left.\n[1969-05-13 18:00:00] at home | I saw that within a short time, the atmosphere became very harmonious. I know even Peppe and Gianni set aside their reserve and became friends with him.\n[1969-05-13 19:00:00] at home | I saw that, no matter what, the meal was still finished. Pietro became very serious and proposed to my father.\n[1969-05-13 19:05:00] at home | I saw that he was very excited when he spoke about it. I saw that made my younger sister's eyes sparkle, and my two younger brothers found it amusing.\n[1969-05-13 19:10:00] at home | I saw my father feeling embarrassed, stammering out some polite words. I heard that Pietro is such an outstanding and serious professor, and this request made him very honored.\n[1969-05-13 19:15:00] at home | I thought this night was going to end perfectly when my mother spoke up.\n[1969-05-13 19:15:30] at home | I saw her face, dark with anger. \"I heard, 'We disagree with the fact that you're not getting married in the church. A wedding without a priest isn't a real wedding.'\"\n[1969-05-13 19:16:00] at home | I saw everyone fall into silence. My father still couldn't help but smile at Pietro, meaning that although he too was part of the \"we\" my wife had mentioned, he was willing to make a concession. I knew my parents must have already secretly agreed, with my mother being the one to bring up the matter.\n[1969-05-13 19:16:30] at home | I saw Pietro also smile at my father, but this time, his conversation partner wasn't my father—he was only speaking to my mother. I know I've already told him my family's stance, and he's made his preparations.\n[1969-05-13 19:17:00] Borgo | I saw that what he said was simple, full of tenderness, but his thoughts were clear. I heard him say that he understood, but also hoped everyone would understand him. He said he respected those who truly believed in God, but he felt he didn't belong to that kind of person.\n[1969-05-13 19:17:30] at home | I heard him say that being a man who didn't believe in God didn't mean he believed in nothing. He was certain of his absolute loyalty to me. He said it was this love, not the altar, the priest, or the city officials, that made our marriage strong.\n[1969-05-13 19:18:00] at home | I heard him say that refusing to get married in the church was a matter of principle for him. If he were a man without principles, I wouldn't have loved him, or I would have loved him less.\n[1969-05-13 19:18:30] at home | I heard him say at last, of course, my mother didn't want to hand her daughter over to someone who could so easily betray the basic principles of his own life.\n[1969-05-13 19:19:00] at home | I saw my father nodding as he listened to these words. I saw my brothers' mouths wide open in surprise, Elena was once again deeply moved, but my mother remained unmoved.\n[1969-05-13 19:20:00] at home | I saw her fiddle with her wedding ring, then look at Pietro's face. She didn't continue the previous conversation, nor did she say she agreed. Instead, she spoke in a cold, determined manner, praising me. I heard her say that I was always a different child, that I was capable of doing something no other girl in the entire Mergellina could accomplish.\n[1969-05-13 19:20:30] Borgo | I heard that I was her pride, and the pride of the whole family, and I had never let her down. She said I had the right to be happy, and if anyone made me suffer, it would hurt her a thousand times more.\n[1969-05-13 19:21:00] at home | I listened, feeling very embarrassed, and throughout the whole thing, I wanted to figure out whether she was serious or just exaggerating as usual. I thought of her purpose as being to make it clear to Pietro that she didn't care about his position at all, nor about the things he was saying. It wasn't that the Greco family needed him, but rather that he needed the Greco family.\n[1969-05-13 19:21:30] at home | I saw that I couldn't figure out her attitude, but my fiancé completely believed what she said, nodding in agreement while my mother was speaking.\n[1969-05-13 19:22:00] at home | I saw that she had finally finished speaking, and then Pietro began to talk. I heard him say that he clearly knew how valuable I was, and he was grateful to my mother for raising me the way I am.\n[1969-05-13 19:22:30] at home | I watched until he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a blue box, handing it to me shyly. I thought, what is this? He's already given me a ring, is he going to give me another one?\n[1969-05-13 19:23:00] at home | I saw myself opening the box. I saw a real ring, very beautiful, made of red gold, set with a purple crystal, and surrounded by small diamonds.\n[1969-05-13 19:23:30] at home | I heard Pietro whisper, \"This is my grandmother's ring. If I could marry you, everyone in my family would be happy.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:24:00] at home | I saw everyone start drinking again, and my father began telling some amusing stories about his personal life and work. Gianni asked Pietro which football team he supported, and Peppe challenged him to a arm-wrestling match. I thought this gift meant the ceremony had ended.\n[1969-05-13 19:30:00] Kitchen at Home | I saw myself helping my sister clear the table. In the kitchen, I immediately made a mistake, and I asked my mother. \"I heard 'How is it?'\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:05] at home Kitchen | \"I heard 'the ring?'\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:10] at home Kitchen | I heard \"Pietro.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:15] at home Kitchen | I heard, \"She's ugly and her legs aren't straight.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:20] Kitchen at Home | I heard, \"Dad wasn't much better than him either.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:25] at home Kitchen | I heard, \"What right do you have to talk about your father?\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:30] at home Kitchen | I heard, \"No.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:30:35] at home Kitchen | I heard, \"Then shut up, you just act so high and mighty in front of us.\"",

If he has his own principles, don't you have your own? Let him respect your principles.'\"\n[1969-05-13 19:31:00] Kitchen at Home | I saw that at this point Elena inserted a word. I heard, \"Mom, Pietro is a gentleman. You don't even know what a real gentleman is like.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:31:10] Kitchen at Home | I heard, \"You know? Be careful! You're still young, don't speak out, or I'll slap you. Did you see his hair? Is that the way a gentleman's hair should be?\"\n[1969-05-13 19:31:20] Elena's Kitchen | I heard, \"There's no standard for a gentleman's appearance, Mom. Whether someone is a gentleman, you can feel it.\"\n[1969-05-13 19:31:30] at home Kitchen | I saw my mother pretend to hit her, and my sister laughed as she pulled me out of the kitchen, saying cheerfully. \"I heard, 'You're really lucky, Elena! Pietro is so thoughtful, he loves you so much! He gave you his grandmother's ring, let me see it.'\"\n[1969-05-13 19:40:00] at home | I saw us return to the restaurant. All the men in the family were wrestling with my fiancé, trying to outdo the professor in strength.\n[1969-05-13 19:40:30] at home | I saw him show no fear, he took off his jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeves, then sat down at the table.\n[1969-05-13 19:45:00] at home | I saw him lose to Peppe, also lose to Gianni, and even lose to my father.\n[1969-05-13 19:50:00] at home | What surprised me was his passion for the game; his face was red, and the veins on his forehead were clearly visible.\n[1969-05-13 19:50:30] at home | I saw him accuse the opponent of openly breaking the rules, especially because he was very stubborn in wrestling with Peppe and Gianni. I know my two younger brothers often lift weights, but my father could unscrew a bolt with one hand.\n[1969-05-13 19:51:00] at home | I watched the entire struggle with the wrench, and he didn't yield at all. I thought about how I was worried his arm might break.\n[1969-05-15 00:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I know that from that time on, for many years, we didn't see each other. We only called each other, and to each other, we had become intermittent voices, with no eye contact at all. The thought of wanting her to die, which I had, remained in some corner of my mind, never leaving me.\n[1969-05-16 03:00:00] Parents' home | On the night before I left for Mergellina, I couldn't sleep. My mind was filled with painful thoughts, and the hardest thing to swallow was Pasquale's criticism. His words pierced my nerves, one by one.\n[1969-05-16 03:30:00] My parents' house | I thought about it at the beginning, trying my best not to think about it, but now I'm not sure if I did the right thing. I thought, Lina said they were right, maybe I really was wrong.\n[1969-05-16 04:00:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I reached the end, and I did something I had never done before: at four in the morning, I got out of bed and went out alone from the house before the sun rose.\n[1969-05-16 04:05:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought I was extremely unhappy, and I wished for some accident, some very bad thing, to punish my wrong actions and my terrible thoughts, and thus also punish her.\n[1969-05-16 04:10:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw nothing happen, I walked alone on the empty street. I felt safer outside than when it was daylight and crowded.\n[1969-05-16 04:30:00] Seafront of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had arrived at the sea. I saw the sky begin to turn purple, under the dimming light, the sea looked like a gray sheet of paper, there were only a few clouds in the sky, and the horizon was pink.\n[1969-05-16 04:31:00] Beach | I saw the daylight slicing Oviedo Castle into two parts. On the side near Vesuvius, it was a dazzling reddish-brown, while on the side near the train station and Posillipo, it was a long stretch of brown. The road along the cliffs was empty, the sea silent, exuding a strong, palpable presence.\n[1969-05-16 04:35:00] Seafront | I thought about what it would be like if, instead of waking up in Mergellina every morning, I woke up in one of those houses by the sea, and I didn't know what I would think about San Gregorio Armeno or about myself.\n[1969-05-16 04:36:00] Seafront | I thought about what I was pursuing? Did I want to change my origin? Change myself, and others? Did I want to fill this empty city with new residents? People who weren't tormented by poverty or greed, who had no resentment or anger, who could appreciate this magnificent view just like the gods who once lived here.\n[1969-05-16 04:37:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought I still had to yield to the demon within me, to live a good life and be happy on my own?\n[1969-05-16 04:38:00] Beach | I know that Pietro's family has fought for socialism for generations, standing by people like Pasquale or Lina. I thought about how I used the power of the Pietro family to help Lina, but I didn't do it with the intention of changing the world's injustices. Instead, I wanted to help someone I loved. If I hadn't done it, I would have felt guilty.\n[1969-05-16 04:39:00] Seafront | Was I wrong? Should I have let Lina get into trouble? I'll never do this again. I'll never move a finger for anyone ever again. I'm leaving. I'm getting married.\n[1969-05-17 12:00:00] Mergellina | I know that now, I can't remember a single thing about my wedding. The few photos that remained didn't trigger my memories; instead, they froze my wedding into a few images. I thought of Pietro's careless attitude, and I felt a bit angry. My mother was slightly blurred in the photo, but she always had that expression of discontent.\n[1969-05-17 12:01:00] Mergellina | I don't remember anything about the ceremony itself, but I clearly recall the long discussions I had with Pietro before our marriage.\n[1969-05-17 12:02:00] Mergellina | I saw him saying it to me. I heard her say, \"I don't want to have a child right away. I want to take birth control pills because the urgent thing now is to write a new book.\"\n[1969-05-17 12:03:00] Mergellina | I saw it, but to my surprise, he opposed it. I thought to myself that I was sure he would agree to my request.\n[1969-05-17 12:04:00] Mergellina | I saw him first raise the question of whether it was legal or not. He said the pills had not been officially released for sale. I heard and then said that he had heard these drugs were harmful to the body, and he went on at length about sex, love, and reproduction with a lot of complicated talk.\n[1969-05-17 12:05:00] Mergellina | I saw him mutter at the end. I heard her say, \"If you really have something to write, even if you're pregnant, you can still write.\"\n[1969-05-17 12:06:00] Mergellina | I felt very upset and angry. I thought his reaction was not something a young scholar who wanted to get married at the civil affairs office should have.\n[1969-05-17 12:07:00] Mergellina | I saw that I told him my thoughts, and we fought.\n[1969-05-17 12:08:00] Mergellina | I saw that on the day of the wedding, we still hadn't made up. He said nothing, and I remained cold and distant.\n[1969-05-17 15:00:00] Mergellina | I saw another shocking thing, and the banquet left me with some memories. I knew we had already decided that after registering our marriage, we would say hello to the relatives and then go home, without holding any kind of wedding banquet.\n[1969-05-17 15:05:00] Mergellina | I knew this choice was due to Pietro's ascetic tendencies. I thought I also wanted to express that I had completely left my mother's world behind, this was a decision my and Pietro had made together.\n[1969-05-17 15:10:00] Mergellina | I saw how our rules were secretly disrupted by Adele Airota, who pulled us to her friend's house, saying it was to have a drink and celebrate.",

    "text": "[1969-05-17 16:00:00] Banquet Hall | I arrived, but when I got there, I and Pietro found ourselves at the center of a grand feast. I saw that it was a very luxurious residence, with many relatives from the Pietro family, many famous people they knew, and highly esteemed individuals who stayed until late at night.\n[1969-05-17 16:10:00] Banquet Hall | I saw my husband's face grow dark, and I asked, confused, why was that? I heard it's a banquet celebrating my wedding, and I only invited my parents and my younger brother and sister.\n[1969-05-17 16:15:00] Ballroom | I said to Pietro. I heard, \"Do you know what's going on?\" \"No.\"\n[1969-05-17 16:30:00] Banquet Hall | I saw it start, and we both faced the situation together, but soon he managed to get away from his mother and sister, who wanted to introduce him to one person after another. He hid in a corner and stayed with my parents, talking with them all the time.\n[1969-05-17 17:00:00] Banquet Hall | I felt a bit uncomfortable at first, but there was nothing to do but go along, and gradually I got used to the trap we had fallen into. But later, I began to feel excited. I thought about the fact that the people I was facing were well-known politicians, senior intellectuals, young revolutionaries, even a very famous poet and a novelist, all of whom showed great interest in me and my novel, praising the article I had published on L'Unità.\n[1969-05-17 18:00:00] Banquet Hall | I saw time flying by quickly. I thought about how I felt completely absorbed into Pietro's world.\n[1969-05-17 18:10:00] Ballroom | I saw my father-in-law even pulling me to his side, politely asking me about my work at the factory.\n[1969-05-17 18:30:00] Banquet Hall | I saw that quickly, a lot of people had gathered together—those who were dedicated to discussing labor issues in newspapers and magazines. We talked about the various waves of workers' petitions that had swept across the country. I thought about being there with them, discussing things, that evening was my festival, I was the center of the entire conversation.\n[1969-05-17 19:00:00] Banquet Hall | I later saw my father-in-law mention an article published in \"Workers' World,\" which he said was well-written and directly pointed out the problems with democracy in Italy.\n[1969-05-17 19:05:00] Banquet Hall | I know the article lists a series of data showing that television, big newspapers, schools, universities, and legal institutions are constantly serving an established ideology, so elections are also full of fraud. The working-class parties will never have enough votes to rule the country. The article is well-reasoned and cites many other articles.\n[1969-05-17 19:10:00] Banquet Hall | I saw that in the end, Professor Pietro spoke with his authoritative tone about the author of the article—Giovanni Nino, that is, Nino. I thought that even before he spoke the name, I had already known it was him.\n[1969-05-17 19:15:00] Banquet Hall | I saw that I was very happy at the time and couldn't help saying, \"I know him.\"\n[1969-05-17 19:20:00] Banquet Hall | I saw that Adele Airota also knew Nino, so I told Adele Airota, to her husband and to the people present, how talented my San Gregorio Armeno friend was.\n[1969-05-17 19:30:00] Banquet Hall | I saw that Nino, although he didn't appear, was still part of my wedding. When mentioning him, I felt it necessary to say something about myself—I began to get involved in the workers' struggle.\n[1969-05-17 19:35:00] Banquet Hall | I said, I need to help them, so that the leftist party and parliamentary representatives can catch up as soon as possible. They need to understand the current political and economic situation, as well as other things I had just learned but was already able to use skillfully.\n[1969-05-17 19:40:00] Banquet Hall | I thought about how I felt great, my mood was getting better and better, I liked standing by my in-laws, feeling appreciated by their friends.\n[1969-05-17 21:00:00] Banquet Hall | I watched until the end, and my family bid me a shy farewell, preparing to leave without knowing where they would stay, waiting for the first train to San Gregorio Armeno.\n[1969-05-17 21:10:00] Banquet Hall | I could hardly stand Pietro's resentment, and he must have sensed that, because he softened first, and our relationship eased up.\n[1969-05-17 23:00:00] Vomero | As soon as we arrived at our place, the door closed behind us, and we started making love. At first, I really liked it, but something else happened that day that surprised me.\n[1969-05-17 23:10:00] Vomero\n[1969-05-17 23:30:00] Vomero | I saw him thinking deeply, powerfully impacting me. I thought I felt, Pietro's time stretched on endlessly. The initial pleasure gradually weakened, his rhythm was monotonous and prolonged, causing my stomach to hurt.\n[1969-05-17 23:35:00] Vomero | I saw that after long hours of hard work, he was drenched in sweat, his face and neck covered with it. I touched his sweaty back, and along with the pain, all my desire disappeared.\n[1969-05-17 23:40:00] Vomero | I saw it, but he didn't notice. He kept pushing into me with force and rhythm, never stopping.\n[1969-05-17 23:45:00] Vomero | I didn't know what to do, I caressed him and whispered sweet words into his ear, hoping he would stop.\n[1969-05-17 23:50:00] Vomero | I felt he was very sensitive when he finally stopped with a loud groan, even though I was in pain and still unsatisfied.\n[1969-05-18 00:00:00] Vomero | I saw him get up not long after getting into bed; he went to the bathroom.\n[1969-05-18 02:00:00] Vomero | I waited for him for a few minutes, but I was too tired and fell asleep. Later, I suddenly woke up and realized he hadn't returned to bed.\n[1969-05-18 02:05:00] Vomero | I saw him in the study, sitting at his desk, asking. I heard, \"What are you doing?\"\n[1969-05-18 02:06:00] Vomero | I saw him smile at me and say. I heard, \"Work.\" \"You go to sleep.\" \"You go ahead, I'll be there in a minute.\"\n[1969-05-18 02:07:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that I was indeed pregnant that very night.\n[1969-06-01 09:00:00] Vomero | I realized I was pregnant and immediately became very anxious; I called my mother. I thought that although there was always conflict between us, in that situation, I really needed her.\n[1969-06-01 09:10:00] Vomero | I realized it was a mistake; she immediately became repulsive. She wanted to leave right away, come to me, help me, guide me. She also wanted to take me back to Mergellina, have me live in her house, and hand me over to an old midwife. I heard myself say to her: \"My mother-in-law has a friend, a gynecologist and a professor. He's examining me, and I'll give birth in his clinic.\"\n[1969-06-01 09:15:00] Vomero | I saw her getting angry. I heard her say to me, word for word: \"If you love your mother-in-law more and don't like me, then don't call me.\"\n[1969-06-05 10:00:00] Vomero | A few days later, Lina called me. She was cheerful, but I was cold. She joked and asked how my new marriage was going. I responded seriously and asked about her health. I know that after I left San Gregorio Armeno, we called each other a few times, but the calls were always short—we didn't want to spend too much on phone bills. I thought about how she would realize something was wrong.\n[1969-06-05 10:01:00] Vomero | \"I heard you're angry with me?\" \"No, why would I be angry with you?\" \"You didn't tell me anything. I found out about this news because your mother told everyone that you've [state of childbirth].\" \"I found out just now too.\"\n[1969-06-05 10:02:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'I thought you were going to take the medicine.'\" \"Then I decided not to.\" \"Why?\" \"Because time doesn't wait.\" I thought I felt embarrassed.\n[1969-06-05 10:03:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Where's the book you were going to write?\" \"You'll see it.\" \"Remember what you said.\" \"I'll try my best.\" \"You should do your best.\" \"I'll try.\"\n[1969-06-05 10:04:00] Vomero | I saw that she was silent, and I didn't say anything either. When she spoke again, she not only told me how she felt during her first [pregnancy], but also described her experience during the second one. She said both were terrible experiences. I heard, \"I'm taking my medicine.\" \"So, you and Enzo are okay?\" \"Very okay, but I'll never want to be [pregnant] again.\"\n[1969-06-05 10:05:00] Vomero | I heard her say, \"The second time, I was sure the child was Nino's, even though I felt uncomfortable, I was secretly happy. But no matter how you feel, look, your body is suffering, changing, it's too painful.\"\n[1969-06-05 10:06:00] Vomero | Since that moment, her tone became increasingly gloomy. Those were all things she had told me before, but she had never, not like this, tried to pull me into her pain, make me feel her suffering as well. I thought she was trying to make me prepare, that she was worried about me and my future.\n[1969-06-05 10:07:00] Vomero | I saw her say that another person's life first lives inside you, and when he finally comes out, he will imprison you, tie you down, and you will never belong to yourself again.\n[1969-06-05 10:08:00] Vomero | I saw her comparing each stage of her [reproductive state] with mine, as vivid and incisive as before. She sighed, saying it was like you were creating trouble for yourself. I thought that her feelings should be the same as mine, but she couldn't possibly imagine that she was herself and I was me.\n[1969-06-05 10:09:00] Vomero | I thought she could never understand that my experience of pregnancy would be completely different from hers, that my feelings toward the child would be entirely different too. She naturally assumed I would face the same difficulties. If I felt happy and fulfilled during my pregnancy, she would surely see it as a betrayal.\n[1969-06-05 10:10:00] Vomero | I didn't want to talk to her anymore, so I moved the receiver a little away from my ear. I thought of her and it made me feel afraid.\n[1969-06-05 10:11:00] Vomero | I saw us saying goodbye without any enthusiasm. \"I heard her say, 'If you need me, just call out.' 'Okay.' 'You've helped me before, now I want to help you.' 'Okay.'\"\n[1969-06-05 12:00:00] Vomero | I thought talking to her would be of no help at all, and instead, it made me feel even more uneasy.",

    "text": "[1969-06-10 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know I live in a strange city, although I have become familiar with every corner of it under my husband's guidance. I thought that I couldn't even say I knew San Gregorio Armeno that well.\n[1969-06-15 17:00:00] Mergellina | I really like the Arno River, and I often take walks along its banks, but I don't like the colors of those houses; they always make me feel bad.\n[1969-06-15 17:30:00] Mergellina | I thought of the annoying way the people in this city spoke, the concierge, the butcher, the baker, and the postman all made me feel repulsive. I had an inexplicable aversion to this city.\n[1969-06-20 20:00:00] Mergellina | I know there are others too, the friends of my father-in-law and mother-in-law, who were so enthusiastic on the day of the wedding, but after that they never showed up again, and Pietro also had no intention of meeting them again. I thought about how I felt lonely and vulnerable.\n[1969-06-21 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that I had bought some books on how to become the perfect mother, and I started reading them diligently as usual.\n[1969-07-15 10:00:00] Mergellina | I thought about how the days passed, then the weeks, and to my surprise, this [pregnancy] thing wasn't a burden at all, but instead made me feel light.\n[1969-07-15 10:01:00] Mergellina | I felt a slight nausea, but my body didn't weaken, and my mood wasn't affected. I was still the same as before, free to do whatever I wanted.\n[1969-08-15 10:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I knew that from that moment on, my life would never be at peace again. In the following months, it seemed that every day brought something good or bad.\n[1969-08-15 10:00:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about returning to San Gregorio Armeno, and all I could think about was Nino, about our meetings that had led to nothing.\n[1969-08-15 10:01:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I sometimes couldn't control myself, wanting to look for Lina, wait for her to finish work, and tell her things that could be told, trying not to hurt her.\n[1969-08-15 10:01:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that in the end, I still gave up. I thought to myself that mentioning Nino was a kind of injury to her.\n[1969-08-15 10:02:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I knew Lina was in trouble, and Nino had already started his own life; I also had a lot of important things to deal with.\n[1969-08-20 18:00:00] Mergellina | I know that when I was three months pregnant, my book won a relatively significant award, which brought me more reputation and some money.\n[1969-08-25 20:00:00] Award Ceremony Venue | I went to accept the award even though the political climate at the time was strongly against it, and I felt proud of myself. I thought about physical and mental fulfillment, which made me forget my shyness, and I became very open.\n[1969-08-25 21:00:00] Award Ceremony Venue | I realized I had spoken too much in the thanks-giving dialogue. I heard myself say that I felt happy, like an astronaut walking on the white moon.\n[1969-08-30 10:00:00] Vomero | A few days later, I felt very strong, so I called Lina and told her about the award. I wanted to tell her that things weren't as bad as she had predicted, that I was doing fine now, that I was very satisfied, and that I felt so proud, wanting to surpass the unease she had caused me.\n[1969-08-30 10:05:00] Vomero | I know Lina saw the message on Il Messaggero, and also what I said about the astronaut—the newspaper from San Gregorio Armeno mentioned the award in a few lines.\n[1969-08-30 10:06:00] Vomero | I saw that before I could even tell her about the award, she already harshly criticized me, mocking me. I heard, \"On the white moon? Sometimes it's better to keep quiet than to say such nonsense.\"\n[1969-08-30 10:07:00] Vomero | I saw, and then she added. I heard, \"The moon is a big stone, just one of billions of stones. Stones are just stones; you'd better keep your feet on the ground and face these troubles on Earth.\"\n[1969-08-30 10:08:00] Vomero | I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. I thought about why she had hurt me like this? Didn't she want me to be happy? Or had she never really gotten better, was her heart disease constantly strengthening her evil side?\n[1969-08-30 10:09:00] Vomero | I wanted to say some harsh words, but I couldn't get them out. I thought, but she seemed completely unaware that she had hurt me, as if she believed she had the right to hurt me.\n[1969-08-30 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw her then speaking to me in a friendly tone, telling me about her life—she had already made peace with her brother, her mother, and even her father.\n[1969-08-30 10:11:00] Vomero | I saw her arguing with Michele about the brand of shoes and the money he owed Rino. She also negotiated with Stefano, hoping that from a financial perspective, he could act as Gennaro's father, not just Maria's.\n[1969-08-30 10:12:00] Vomero | I saw her say some very angry things about her brother Rino, as well as about the Solara brothers and Stefano, sometimes very vulgar.\n[1969-08-30 10:13:00] Vomero | I saw her at the end and she asked me, as if she really needed my opinion. I heard, \"Did I do the right thing?\"\n[1969-08-30 10:14:00] Vomero | I saw that I hadn't answered her. I thought about how I had won a prize, but she only remembered the words I'd said about astronauts.\n[1969-08-30 10:15:00] Vomero | I asked, perhaps to provoke her, whether she still had that feeling of her mind being disconnected. I heard her say, \"No.\"\n[1969-08-30 10:16:00] Vomero | I saw her repeat it many times, saying that she was fine. When she said these words, she had a mocking smile. I heard, \"Sometimes, I catch someone coming out of the furniture with my peripheral vision.\"\n[1969-08-30 10:17:00] Vomero | I later saw her ask me about my [pregnancy status], and I said. I heard, \"Very good, very, very good, I've never felt this good before.\"\n[1969-10-15 10:00:00] Locations: All over Italy | I saw those months, I was often traveling, often invited—not just because of the book, but also because of some articles I had written. I know that sometimes, in order to write these articles, I have to go out and get close to the new forms of strikes and the reactions of the bosses.\n[1969-10-15 12:00:00] Locations across Italy | I never thought I would become a public intellectual, but doing these things makes me happy. I feel like I'm rebelliously and powerfully resisting, and my gentle appearance is just a disguise.\n[1969-10-15 14:00:00] At the factory gate | I saw, actually, because of this, I mingled with the crowd at the factory gate, talking with male and female workers and union members, moving about among the police. I thought I wasn't afraid at all.\n[1969-12-12 16:30:00] Via Caracciolo | When I saw the Agricultural Bank get blown up, I was at Porto's publishing house, but I wasn't worried at all. I thought I had no ominous signs.\n[1969-12-12 17:00:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought to myself, I am a force that cannot be resisted, I feel invincible, no one can hurt me, and there's the child in my belly.\n[1969-12-12 17:01:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought about how the two of us were one, a lasting existence. I was the one in the spotlight, while he—or she, as Pietro hoped it would be a boy—still hadn't seen it yet.\n[1969-12-12 17:05:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought that what was left was just a gust of wind, waves of sounds and images, whether good or bad, all of which made up the material of my work. These things either faded away with the wind or became the substance of my writing, transformed through the magic of language into a story, an article, or a public dialogue.\n[1969-12-12 17:10:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought about how I didn't care at all whether what I said or wrote conformed to social norms, or whether the Pietros, the publisher, or Nino liked it.\n[1969-12-12 17:15:00] Via Caracciolo | I thought that Nino must be watching me as I wrote all this, and so too would Pasquale, Nadia, and Lina. Why not? They would surely think: See, we were unjust to Elena, and she always stood by us. Look at what she's written.",

    "text": "[1969-12-15 22:00:00] Vomero | I know that the stage of my [reproductive status] was a very active period. What surprised me was that after [pregnancy status], I felt even more eager for sex.\n[1969-12-15 22:30:00] Vomero | I saw that I was arousing Pietro's interest, I embraced him and [intimate act] him. I thought that even though he wasn't interested in [intimate acts], he wanted to get straight to the point, tormenting me in his long, painful way.\n[1969-12-15 23:00:00] Vomero | I saw and then he would get up, working until very late.\n[1969-12-16 01:00:00] New Home | I know that after sleeping for an hour or two, I will wake up. When I can't find him in bed, I'll turn on the light and read until I'm exhausted.\n[1969-12-16 03:00:00] Vomero | I would go to his room at that point, and ask him to [intimate act] sleep with me. He would obey me, but he'd get up early in the morning. I thought that he was afraid of sleep, while I had slept until noon.\n[1969-12-20 15:00:00] New Bilong | I saw myself at the gate of New Bologna, where the conflict happened, and I ran away immediately. I knew that by this time, I had reached my seventh month of pregnancy, and my belly was big and heavy. I thought of only one thing that made me very uneasy.\n[1969-12-20 15:05:00] New Bilong | I saw that maybe because I made an inappropriate movement, for some reason, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my right buttock, which spread all the way down my leg, as if a red-hot iron rod had been inserted into it.\n[1969-12-20 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself limping back home, falling onto the bed, and slowly waiting for the pain to pass.\n[1969-12-25 10:00:00] Vomero | I felt that pain from time to time, especially in my thigh and groin area. I gradually got used to the pain and tried changing positions to ease it. But when I realized I was limping while walking, I became very scared.\n[1969-12-26 10:00:00] Doctor's Clinic | I went to the doctor who gave me regular checkups.\n[1969-12-26 10:10:00] Doctor's Clinic | I saw him telling me to be at ease, saying everything was normal. My child in my belly was getting heavier, which caused my sciatica, and he asked gently. I heard, \"Why are you so worried? You've always been a cheerful person.\"\n[1969-12-26 10:11:00] Doctor's Clinic | I said, I don't know why I was so worried. I realized I had lied, but in my heart I knew very well that I was afraid my mother's steps would be imprinted on me, and I would limp like her.\n[1969-12-26 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw the gynecologist, who said some comforting words to me, and I calmed down. My pain lasted for a while longer, then finally disappeared.\n[1970-01-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro preventing me from doing other crazy things; he wouldn't let me run around.\n[1970-01-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I followed him, in the final stage of my reproductive state, I spent all my time reading at home, hardly writing anything.\n[1970-02-12 05:30:00] Clinic | I saw that after a severe contraction, I gave birth to the child, but the pain didn't last very long. I know our daughter was born on February 12, 1970, at 5:30 in the morning.\n[1970-02-12 05:35:00] Clinic | I saw that we called her Adele Airota. I heard her, even though my mother-in-law kept saying, \"Poor child, Adele Airota is a terrible name; you should give her another name, any name would be better than that.\"\n[1970-02-12 06:00:00] Clinic | I saw her after she was born, looking at her jet-black hair, her purple little body writhing and crying with strong, powerful cries. I thought of the indescribable pleasure I felt, a kind of joy I had never experienced before.\n[1970-02-13 10:00:00] Clinic | I saw that we hadn't given the child a baptism, and my mother said many harsh things on the phone. She swore she wouldn't come to see the child. I thought to myself, she would calm down, but suddenly I felt sad. If she didn't come, it would be her loss.\n[1970-02-13 11:00:00] Clinic | I saw that as soon as I could get up, I called Lina, I wanted to tell her as soon as possible that I had given birth, I didn't want her to be angry.\n[1970-02-13 11:05:00] Clinic | I saw her saying it to me. I heard, \"It's a wonderful experience.\" \"What?\" \"Having a child, Adele Airota is beautiful and well-behaved.\"\n[1970-02-13 11:06:00] Clinic | I saw her answer. I heard, \"Everyone can describe their life however they want.\"\n[1970-02-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought about that stage, and I found that my mind was filled with tangled threads, some old and faded, some new, sometimes very bright in color, sometimes colorless, extremely thin, almost invisible.\n[1970-02-15 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw the child was very disobedient, like an accidental movement that revealed the most worn-out and hidden parts. I thought I was lucky to have escaped Lina's prophecy, but that sense of happiness and ease suddenly vanished.\n[1970-02-16 10:00:00] Vomero | At first, when we were still at the clinic, she had no problem nursing, but as soon as we got home, something went wrong. She wouldn't take me anymore. She'd take a few sips of milk and then start crying like an angry little animal.\n[1970-02-16 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought I felt weak, as if I'd been cursed. What happened? Was my nipple too small for her to grasp? Did she not like my milk? Or did she hate me—her mother—so much, or was it because someone had cast a spell on her?\n[1970-02-17 10:00:00] Doctor's Clinic | I started going from doctor to doctor, just me and my daughter. I knew it was because Pietro had been busy with university matters.\n[1970-02-17 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw my chest swollen and painful, a burning sensation inside my breasts. To get the milk out, to feed the baby with a bottle, and to ease the pain, I tortured myself with the breast pump. I thought about how it might have become inflamed and suppurated.\n[1970-02-17 11:10:00] Vomero | I saw her as I spoke softly to her. I heard, \"Come on, suck, good girl, so obedient, pretty little mouth, beautiful eyes, is there anything wrong?\"\n[1970-02-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that it was still no use. I first made a sad decision to combine breastfeeding with formula, but finally I gave up and started feeding her only with formula.\n[1970-02-20 12:00:00] Vomero | I watched day and night, and preparing the formula was a long process; I had to sterilize the nipple and bottle, and I had to weigh the baby before and after each feeding. I always feel deeply frightened whenever the child has diarrhea.\n[1970-02-20 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself crying alone and silently on many occasions. I sometimes think about how Sylvia, in the turbulent atmosphere of the Porto student assembly, breastfed Milko, Nino's son, with such natural ease. Why couldn't I do that?\n[1970-03-01 10:00:00] Vomero | For a few days, the child's eating became normal again, and I felt a great relief. I hoped to reorganize my life.\n[1970-03-08 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that this peaceful life lasted less than a week. In the first year of her life, she never slept at night; her small body would convulse and cry for hours, full of strength and showing an unexpected endurance.\n[1970-03-08 23:00:00] Vomero | I saw that only when I held her in my arms and walked around the house would she calm down.\n[1970-03-08 23:30:00] Vomero | I saw that I would have to keep talking to her. I heard, \"My good child, my beautiful child, be quiet and rest now, go to sleep...\"\n[1970-03-08 23:45:00] Vomero | I saw that this beautiful little creature didn't want to sleep. I thought of her as afraid of sleeping just like her father.\n[1970-03-09 00:00:00] Vomero | What happened to her? Is she in pain? Hungry? Afraid of being abandoned? Because I didn't breastfeed her? Did she get possessed? What's wrong with me? Is there poison in my milk? What's wrong with my legs? Is it just my imagination, or have they really started hurting again? Was it my mother's fault? She wanted to punish me because all my efforts in life were to avoid becoming like her? Or was there some other reason?",

    "text": "[1970-04-15 02:00:00] Vomero | I thought back to one night when Giullia's voice echoed again in my ears, and at that time she was saying all over Mergellina that Lina had a terrible power, that she could make things get possessed and catch fire, that she could expel the child from her belly. I felt ashamed of myself.\n[1970-04-15 02:10:00] Vomero | I saw that I needed to take action, I needed rest, I tried to hand my daughter over to Pietro's care. I thought that because he was used to studying at night, he wouldn't be very sleepy in the evening.\n[1970-04-15 02:11:00] Vomero | I said what I saw. I heard, \"I'm too tired, come wake me in two hours.\"\n[1970-04-15 02:12:00] Vomero | I saw myself lying in bed and immediately fell asleep, as if losing consciousness.\n[1970-04-15 04:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but later I was woken up by a child's desperate crying. I waited a while, but the crying never stopped.\n[1970-04-15 04:05:00] Vomero | I saw myself getting up, and I found that Pietro had moved the child's cradle into his study.\n[1970-04-15 04:06:00] Vomero | I saw that he didn't pay much attention to the child's heart-rending crying, still hunched over his work as if he were deaf, filling out some forms.\n[1970-04-15 04:07:00] Vomero | I saw myself losing control and cursed him in the local dialect. I heard, \"You don't care about anything, that thing is more important than your daughter, right?\"\n[1970-04-15 04:08:00] Vomero | I saw my husband coldly and utterly indifferent, ordering me to leave his room, along with the baby's crib. I knew he had a very important article to finish, written for an English magazine, and the deadline was approaching.\n[1970-04-16 10:00:00] Vomero | I didn't ask for his help again after that, and if he offered it voluntarily, I would say. I heard, \"Thank you, no need. Go ahead, I know you have things to do.\"\n[1970-04-16 20:00:00] Vomero | After dinner, he would linger by my side, clumsy and unsure of what to do, then lock himself in the study and work until late at night.\n[1970-05-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought I felt abandoned, but I felt I deserved it: I couldn't make my daughter calm down.\n[1970-05-01 10:30:00] Vomero | I saw that no matter what, even as I became more and more afraid, I gritted my teeth and kept going. I thought about how my body refused to become a mother.\n[1970-05-01 12:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself trying my best to fight against my legs, ignoring the pain in them, but the ache was growing stronger. I gritted my teeth and kept going, carrying everything up the stairs.\n[1970-05-01 12:10:00] Vomero | I saw that the building didn't have an elevator, so I put the child in the stroller, carried the stroller up and down myself, went shopping, and came back carrying many bags.\n[1970-05-01 12:20:00] Vomero | I saw myself cleaning the house, cooking. I thought to myself: I will soon become old and ugly, just like the women in Mergellina.\n[1970-05-01 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw nature, just when I was feeling extremely desperate, Lina called me.\n[1970-05-01 14:01:00] Vomero | I thought, as soon as I heard her voice, I wanted to scream at her: \"What have you done to me? Everything was going smoothly at first, and then suddenly, just like you said, the child is uncomfortable, and my leg is broken. How could this happen? I can't take it anymore.\"\n[1970-05-01 14:02:00] Vomero | I saw it, but I managed to restrain myself in time. I said in a low voice. I heard, \"Everything's fine, the child had some troubles, but she's grown a bit now, she's very beautiful, and I'm very happy.\"\n[1970-05-01 14:03:00] Vomero | After seeing it, I started asking about Enzo and Gennaro, about her relationship with Stefano and her brother, and about our Mergellina situation.\n[1970-05-01 14:04:00] Vomero | I asked her if there were still questions with Bruno Socavo and Michele, and she answered me in a crude, vulgar dialect, but there was no anger in her tone. I heard her say that Soccavo should be made to bleed; Michele, if I met him, I'd spit in his face.\n[1970-05-01 14:05:00] Vomero | I saw that, when she mentioned Gennaro, she already considered him to be Stefano's son, she said. I heard, \"He's just like his father.\"\n[1970-05-01 14:06:00] Vomero | I said he was a lovely child, and she laughed and said. I heard, \"You're a good mother, take it and raise it.\"\n[1970-05-01 14:07:00] Vomero | I thought that in these words, I detected a hint of mockery—the tone of someone who knew my situation through some mysterious ability—and I felt angry.\n[1970-05-01 14:08:00] Vomero | I saw it, but I still insisted on playing my part well. I heard her say, \"Listen to Dede's voice, how lovely it is! Life with Mergellina is so good! I'm reading a book by Balan, it's a very interesting book.\"\n[1970-05-01 14:09:00] Vomero | I realized I had been saying the same things all along, until she forced me to lower the curtain, and then she started talking to me about the IBM System course at Enzo.\n[1970-05-01 14:10:00] Vomero | I saw that she spoke with respect only when talking about Enzo. She talked for a long time, and finally asked about Pietro. I heard, \"Are you and your husband doing well?\" \"Fine.\" \"Enzo and I are also doing well.\"\n[1970-05-01 14:15:00] Vomero | I saw her hang up the phone, and her voice left a long echo, filled with images and words from the past, lingering in my mind for hours.\n[1970-05-01 14:16:00] Vomero | I thought of the courtyard, the dangerous game, the doll she had thrown into the cellar, the dark stairs I had taken to her house to get the doll back, her marriage, her generosity and her evilness, and the way she had gotten Nino.\n[1970-05-01 14:17:00] Vomero | I thought about how she couldn't stand my luck, and I felt full of fear, thinking that she again wanted to use me, to put me at a disadvantage, so I could deal with her miserable struggles in Mergellina.\n[1970-05-01 14:18:00] Vomero | I heard the last part and said to myself, \"I'm really stupid! What's the point of all this schooling?\" I thought about how I had pretended everything was under my control.\n[1970-05-01 15:00:00] Vomero | I told her that I often called my sister Elena. I heard, \"Being a mother is truly wonderful.\"\n[1970-05-01 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pinochietta Peluso call me, telling me she had married the man at the gas station on the main road, I replied. I heard, \"Ah, what a great piece of news. I wish you happiness and fulfillment. Please give my regards to Pasquale. What's he up to these days?\"\n[1970-05-01 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself talking to my mother—she rarely called me—and I acted cheerful. Once, I couldn't help but ask her. I heard her ask, \"What's wrong with your leg? Why do you walk with a limp?\" She replied, \"Mind your own business, take care of yourself.\"\n[1970-06-01 10:00:00] Vomero | For months, I was fighting alone, trying to hide my dark side. Sometimes, I even began to pray to the Virgin, though I was an atheist, and I felt ashamed of myself.\n[1970-06-01 12:00:00] Vomero | More often than not, when I'm alone at home with the child, I let out terrible screams—just screams, no words, just breaths that come out with despair.\n[1970-06-01 14:00:00] Vomero | I thought about that awful phase that just wouldn't go away, a very slow and tormenting period.\n[1970-06-02 02:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself at night, holding the child and limping back and forth in the corridor. I no longer said senseless things in her ear; I completely ignored her, thinking only of myself.\n[1970-06-02 02:10:00] Vomero | I saw that I would always be holding a book or a magazine in my hands, even though I couldn't concentrate on reading, or could only read a little bit.\n[1970-06-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw her sleeping peacefully during the day - I tried to write an article for the newspaper. I knew at first I called her \"A Dai,\" without realizing that these two syllables contained the meaning of \"hell.\" Later, Pietro reminded me, and I felt embarrassed, so I started calling her Dede.\n[1970-06-02 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but I didn't have time. Of course, I couldn't go around for L'Unità, so the things I wrote lost their power. I thought I was just showing off my strong ability to express myself, my elegant style, but nothing substantial.\n[1970-06-05 10:00:00] Vomero | I remember once I wrote an article, and before submitting it to the editor, I showed it to Pietro, who said. I heard \"It's very hollow.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Just a pile of words.\"\n[1970-06-05 11:00:00] Vomero | I was very angry, but I still sent the article to the editor, but they didn't publish it.",

Not long ago, I had thought the living and working conditions I had fought for were unshakable.\n[1970-06-10 14:00:00] Vomero | I see, but now when I read, my eyes are on the book or magazine, but it seems I only stay on the surface of the words, and I can't grasp the meaning anymore.\n[1970-06-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw it two or three times, I happened to come across Nino's articles, but when I read these articles, I didn't feel any pleasure, no longer the usual pleasure of imagining his voice, enjoying his thoughts.\n[1970-06-15 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought of course I was happy for him: if he was writing, that meant he was in good shape. I didn't know where he was living his life, or who he was with.\n[1970-06-15 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw it, but I stared at the signature. I read a few lines and a growing sense of something began to take hold. I thought of the things he had written in black and white, which made my situation even more unbearable.\n[1970-06-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I realized I had lost all curiosity, and I no longer even cared about my own appearance. I thought, but then again, for whom am I getting dressed? Besides Pietro, I don't see anyone else. He has always been polite to me, but I feel that, to him, I'm just a shadow.\n[1970-06-20 12:00:00] Vomero | Sometimes I put myself in his position, and I could feel his dissatisfaction; marrying me made his life as a scholar more complicated.\n[1970-06-20 12:05:00] Vomero | I know that at this stage, his reputation is on the rise, especially in Britain and America, where people greatly appreciate him.\n[1970-06-20 12:10:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but it still annoyed me. When I spoke to him, there was always a hint of resentment and submission in my voice.\n[1970-07-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought enough! One day I said to myself, forget about L'Unità, if I can find the right breakthrough for my new book, that would be good enough. Once this book comes out, everything will get better. But which book was I actually talking about?\n[1970-07-01 11:00:00] Vomero | I told my mother-in-law and the publisher that the book was almost finished, but I was lying. I always lied in a very polite way.\n[1970-07-01 12:00:00] Vomero | I thought that in reality, I only had some notebooks filled with notes, nothing else, and I didn't have much passion either.\n[1970-07-01 14:00:00] Vomero | I would look through these notes, whether it was night or day — it depended on Dede's condition — and every time I did, I would fall asleep involuntarily.\n[1970-07-15 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw one afternoon, when Pietro came back from the university, and he found my condition worse than the last time he had suddenly returned. I saw myself in the kitchen, asleep on the table.\n[1970-07-15 16:05:00] Vomero | I saw the child had missed her feeding time, and her father saw her half-naked in the crib, left there forgotten. I saw, in the distance, in the bedroom, screaming.\n[1970-07-15 16:30:00] Vomero | I saw that later Dede finally calmed down, hugging the bottle and sucking desperately, at that moment, Pietro said to me sadly. I heard, \"You really can't find anyone to help you?\"\n[1970-07-15 16:31:00] Vomero | I heard, \"In this city, I have no one, you know that well.\" \"Have your mother or sister come.\" \"I don't want to.\"\n[1970-07-15 16:32:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Then have that friend of San Gregorio Armeno come and help: you've helped her before, and she'll help you.\"\n[1970-07-15 16:32:10] Vomero | I saw it and my body shivered with shock. I thought I could clearly feel it—that moment, part of my body seemed already to have sensed Lina in my home, she was already there.\n[1970-07-15 16:32:20] Vomero | I thought that if she had been hiding in my body all along, she would now slip into Dede's body, her eyes squinting, her brow furrowed.\n[1970-07-15 16:32:30] Vomero | I saw myself shaking my head very forcefully, and the image vanished at once, along with that possibility. What was I really thinking?\n[1970-07-15 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro give in, he called his mother and reluctantly asked her whether she would be willing to come and stay with us for a while.\n[1970-07-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I felt a wave of relief when I saw that my mother-in-law was handling the household matters. I thought about how she had acted, and it made me want to be a woman like her.\n[1970-07-25 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw my mother-in-law carefully instructing her on what she needed to do: tidy the house, go shopping, and cook. I knew that in just a few days, she had found a girl in her twenties named Clelia, from Maremma.\n[1970-07-25 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw how Pietro became impatient when he found out that Clelia had come home without his mother asking for his opinion. I heard, \"I don't want to have a slave in the house.\"\n[1970-07-25 18:01:00] Vomero | I saw Adele Airota speak slowly and calmly. I heard, \"She's not a slave, we pay her a salary.\"\n[1970-07-25 18:02:00] Vomero | I couldn't help but say it because my mother-in-law was backing me up. I heard, \"So what do you think, should I be a slave?\" \"You should be a mother, not a slave.\"\n[1970-07-25 18:03:00] Vomero | I heard, \"I wash your clothes, iron them, clean the house, cook for you, and gave birth to your child. I've struggled so hard to raise her, and I'm about to break.\" \"Who forced you? When did I ever ask you to?\"\n[1970-07-25 18:05:00] Vomero | I saw her using a sarcastic and mocking tone to gradually wear down her son. I thought I couldn't stand such conflicts, but Adele Airota could.\n[1970-08-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that Clelia stayed behind. She took the baby from my hands and brought the crib to the room I had arranged for her. Whether by day or night, she was always punctual in preparing the baby's formula.\n[1970-08-02 10:00:00] Doctor's Clinic | When my mother-in-law saw me walking with a limp, she took me to see a doctor, who was a friend of hers. The doctor gave me some injections.\n[1970-08-05 08:00:00] Vomero | I saw her every morning and evening, personally taking the sterilized syringes and needles, along with the medicine, and injecting them into my butt. She did it accurately and firmly. I thought I would feel much better soon, the pain in my legs disappeared, and my mood gradually brightened.\n[1970-08-10 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that Adele Airota didn't stop taking care of me; she politely asked me to get myself together, took me for a haircut, and took me to the dentist.\n[1970-08-15 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw, and in particular, she kept talking to me about theaters, cinemas, and the books she was translating or writing, what articles others had written in magazines, and reviews of her husband's or other celebrities' works. I know she affectionately called these people by their names.\n[1970-08-15 16:30:00] Vomero | I saw, for the first time, a very militant feminist magazine mentioned by her. I know Mariarosa is very passionate about feminism. She knows the girls who edit the magazine and greatly respects their ideas.\n[1970-08-15 16:35:00] Vomero | I saw that my mother-in-law didn't agree with these people. She spoke in her usual sarcastic tone, saying that they treated women's issues as if they were matters of class struggle, but the problem wasn't that simple. Finally, she advised me. I heard, \"Look at the things they write.\"\n[1970-08-15 16:40:00] Vomero | I saw that she had left me a few magazines, and finally said a serious sentence. I heard, \"If you want to be a writer, you can't miss anything.\"\n[1970-08-15 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself putting those magazines aside. I thought to myself, if Adele Airota didn't like something, I didn't need to waste my time watching it.",

    "text": "[1970-08-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought, especially in that situation, the refined words my mother-in-law said weren't meant to have a meaningful exchange with me; Adele Airota was simply planning to rescue me from the position of an incapable mother.\n[1970-08-20 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought she was trying to spark something with her words, to ignite my empty mind and gaze, but in reality, she preferred to save me rather than listen to me.\n[1970-09-01 02:00:00] Vomero | I saw that even though everything had been sorted out, Dede would still cry at night. I heard her crying and felt uneasy. I thought of how she had conveyed a sense of unhappiness to me, turning all the benefits brought by my mother-in-law's kindness into thin air. Even though I now have the time, I still can't write.\n[1970-09-01 20:00:00] Vomero | I usually saw Pietro as patient, but in front of his mother, he became very reckless, even somewhat rude. It made my sense of failure even stronger.\n[1970-09-01 20:30:00] Vomero | I saw that once he got home, he always ended up fighting with his mother, exchanging sharp words and sarcastic remarks.\n[1970-09-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I realized that my husband naturally considered Adele Airota the root of all the troubles he'd recently encountered. Whatever happened, he would blame his mother, including his misfortunes at work.\n[1970-09-02 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but in front of his mother, he broke those limits, speaking to her with the resentful tone of a neglected son. He revealed before Adele Airota the side of himself that he had hidden from me. I realized I didn't understand the tense atmosphere on campus back then. Usually, when I asked him how he was, he'd always say fine. He preferred not to let me worry, and he vented himself as if I wasn't even there, as though I—the wife—was just a silent witness.\n[1970-09-03 10:00:00] Vomero | I know that all his colleagues at the university were older than him, and they attributed his brilliant prospects, including the reputation he had gained abroad, to his family background and his surname, so they began to isolate him. I thought that in this way, things were becoming increasingly clear.\n[1970-09-03 10:05:00] Vomero | I know the students think he's too strict and of no use. He's a boring bourgeois, tending his little vegetable garden and completely ignoring the current situation. In short, he's a class enemy. I think of him, and usually he neither defends himself nor attacks others, but instead walks his own path.\n[1970-09-03 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought about how he was convinced—very sure of it—that clear and well-structured lessons were a guarantee that students would be able to think deeply, and in the end, they would bear fruit, but everything was difficult.\n[1970-09-05 20:00:00] Vomero | One night, I saw him shouting these circumstances at Adele Airota with a voice full of resentment.\n[1970-09-05 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw it, and immediately he lowered his voice, muttering. I heard, \"I need silence. The work has already made me very tired, and many colleagues are uniting with the students against me.\"\n[1970-09-05 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw him tell me that groups of young people would often break into his classroom while he was teaching, forcing him to stop the class and spray very vulgar slogans on the walls.\n[1970-09-05 20:15:00] Vomero | I said something out of control at this moment, before Adele Airota even opened her mouth. I heard, \"If you weren't so reactionary, none of this would have happened to you.\"\n[1970-09-05 20:16:00] Vomero | I saw him, and for the first time since I'd known him, he spoke to me in a rough, violent tone. I heard, \"Shut up, you always talk nonsense.\"\n[1970-09-05 20:20:00] Vomero | I saw myself locked in the bathroom. I thought, I suddenly realized, I don't know him at all, what do I really know about him?\n[1970-09-05 20:25:00] Vomero | I thought he was a calm man, but full of determination, so stubborn that he became inflexible. He stood on the side of the workers and students, yet his way of teaching and giving exams was the most traditional.\n[1970-09-05 20:26:00] Vomero | I thought he was an atheist, that he didn't want to get married in a church, and that he insisted on not having Dede baptized. But he appreciated the Christian groups in the Arno Valley, and when it came to religious matters, he always seemed to know everything.\n[1970-09-05 20:27:00] Vomero | I thought he was the son of the Pietro family, but he couldn't stand the wealth and privilege that family brought him.\n[1970-09-05 20:30:00] Vomero | I thought I had calmed down, and I wanted to stand by his side, to let him feel my emotions and support. He was my husband, I thought. We should communicate more.\n[1970-09-05 20:35:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but Adele Airota's presence was a problem. There was something unspoken between mother and son that made Pietro, when speaking, abandon his usual polite manner. The way Adele Airota spoke to him sounded as if he were a hopeless idiot.\n[1970-09-10 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw that this is how we lived—full of conflicts. He kept arguing with his mother, and in the end, he would say things that made me so angry that I would respond to him in the same harsh way.\n[1970-09-15 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw it get to the point where, during dinner, my mother-in-law asked him right in front of me why he was sleeping on the sofa, and he answered. I heard, \"You'd better go back tomorrow.\"\n[1970-09-15 20:01:00] Vomero | I saw that, even though I knew why he was sleeping on the sofa, I didn't say anything. I know he did it for me. After working until three in the morning, he would rest on the sofa to avoid disturbing me.\n[1970-09-16 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that the next day, Adele Airota had returned to Genoa. I thought I had completely lost myself.\n[1971-02-12 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that later, my child and I lived in peace for several months, and Dede learned to walk on her first birthday.\n[1971-02-12 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw her father crouching in front of her, clapping his hands. She smiled, let go of my hand, and wobbled toward her father, her hands open, her mouth slightly parted. I thought that after crying for a year, she had finally reached the end of happiness.\n[1971-02-15 10:00:00] Vomero | Since then, she began to sleep soundly at night, and I also found peace.\n[1971-04-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I noticed that my daughter was spending more and more time with Clelia, and my anxiety eased a bit. I gained some personal space, but I found that I didn't want to bother with work at all. I thought of it as if I had just recovered from a long illness, and I was eager to be outside, to enjoy the sunlight and the vibrant life, walking on crowded streets and admiring the goods in the shop windows.\n[1971-04-01 12:00:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw myself buying a lot of clothes for myself, the kids, and Pietro, and buying a lot of furniture and decorations for the house. I had never spent money so carelessly before. I knew that at that stage, I had a lot of money.\n[1971-04-01 18:00:00] Vomero | I wanted to dress up and meet some interesting people, but I couldn't connect with anyone.\n[1971-04-01 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw that, on the other hand, Pietro rarely brought guests to his house.\n[1971-05-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I tried to slowly get back to my old life, the active one from a year ago, but I realized that the phone at home rarely rang, and calls coming to me were becoming fewer and fewer.\n[1971-05-01 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw my novel fading, and people gradually lost interest in me. I thought about how, after that ecstatic phase, worry would follow, sometimes even depression.\n[1971-05-01 12:00:00] Vomero | I found myself wondering what to do, and I started reading modern literature again. I often felt ashamed of the novels I wrote. Compared to other works, my books seemed trivial and overly traditional.\n[1971-05-01 14:00:00] Vomero | I put aside the notes for my new novel because the content was too similar to my previous work. I tried to come up with something substantial that reflected the current turbulent social reality.\n[1971-05-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself calling L'Unità very timidly, and I was still thinking about writing an article for them, but I immediately realized that the editor no longer liked what I had written.\n[1971-05-02 11:00:00] Vomero | I thought about how I had lost my own territory, how my information was too scarce, and I didn't have the time to take part in the events as they were happening, let alone tell their story.\n[1971-05-02 12:00:00] Vomero | I thought about how I could only write beautiful, abstract sentences, and I didn't know where, to whom, to show: I agreed with the harsh criticism of the Italian leftist parties and trade unions.\n[1971-05-02 13:00:00] Vomero | I think it's hard for me to explain now why I wrote those things, or to be more specific, even though I rarely took part in the political life of this city, even though I was gentle, I felt myself increasingly drawn to some extreme ideas.\n[1971-05-02 14:00:00] Vomero | I thought I was doing it because of laziness, or because I had lost faith in the practice of mediation.\n[1971-05-02 15:00:00] Vomero | Since I was a child, I've been familiar with the fact that my father took advantage of loopholes in the city government to gain some benefits, or rather, I have personally experienced what it means to live in poverty. I feel it is necessary to remember everything I've gone through. I want to stand with the lower class, to fight alongside them and overthrow everything.\n[1971-05-02 16:00:00] Vomero | I thought, or perhaps because of the scattered political activities I took part in, my efforts to write requests and appeals were ignored by everyone. I hoped for some major event—I've used this expression before, I often said things like that—after which I would be able to see and tell about it.\n[1971-05-02 17:00:00] Vomero | I thought, or perhaps—It's hard for me to admit—my way of thinking was still like Lina's, sticking to my irrational attitude and refusing to accept any compromise.\n[1971-05-02 18:00:00] Vomero | I thought that even though I have now distanced myself from her in every way, if she hadn't locked herself inside the Mergellina, if she had the same opportunities as me, what she might have done, what she might have said.",

    "text": "[1971-05-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I stopped buying L'Unità and started reading \"Continue Fighting\" and Il Manifesto. I found that sometimes articles by Nino appeared on Il Manifesto.\n[1971-05-15 10:30:00] Vomero | I knew his article, as usual, was full of data, and the logic was very clear, with a complete structure.\n[1971-05-15 11:00:00] Vomero | I felt, just like when I was a child and talked with him, that I urgently needed to write well-structured complex sentences, mastering the techniques that would keep me from getting lost.\n[1971-05-15 12:00:00] Vomero | I realized that I could no longer think of him with desire or admiration. I felt that he had become the embodiment of my regret, the symbol of a chance I had once had but would never be able to become like him.\n[1971-05-15 13:00:00] Vomero | I thought about how we were both born into the same environment, both had good prospects, so why am I now in such a bleak situation? Because of marriage? Because I had Dede? Because I'm a woman, because I have to take care of the house, change my child's diapers, clean up after him?\n[1971-05-15 14:00:00] Vomero | I see it every time, I see Nino's articles. If the article is written beautifully, my mood turns bad.\n[1971-05-15 18:00:00] Vomero | I thought of Pietro as a victim, and in fact, my husband was my only conversational partner.\n[1971-05-15 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I was angry with him, I accused him, I said. I heard, \"This is the worst phase of my life, you left me behind and didn't care.\"\n[1971-05-15 20:00:00] Vomero | I thought about our relationship—the fact that I found it hard to admit, because it frightened me, but it was true—was getting worse and worse.\n[1971-05-15 21:00:00] Vomero | I thought I understood, because of his work, his situation was also very difficult, but I still couldn't forgive him.\n[1971-05-15 22:00:00] Vomero | I realized I had been criticizing him all along, usually sharing the same political stance as those students who were always looking for trouble with him.\n[1971-05-15 23:00:00] Vomero | I saw him listening to me with great impatience, hardly ever responding.\n[1971-05-16 00:00:00] Vomero | I thought back to those times, and I wondered whether the words he had shouted at me—\"Be quiet! You just talk nonsense\"—weren't just an overwrought remark in the heat of the moment, but rather his usual way of seeing me, the way he felt about me, that he couldn't have a serious conversation with me.\n[1971-05-16 01:00:00] Vomero | I thought about it, and it made me feel extremely desperate and depressed. My resentment was gradually rising, especially within myself, where a complex mix of emotions was filling my heart.\n[1971-05-16 02:00:00] Vomero | I thought of a very blunt way to put it: It's precisely because of social injustice that learning is a very hard thing for some people (like me), but for others it's just a pastime (like for Pietro). On the other hand, regardless of whether society is fair or not, people must study, and that's a good thing, a very good thing.\n[1971-05-16 03:00:00] Vomero | I thought about my academic experiences and the talents I had shown, which filled me with pride. I found it hard to believe that I was wasting my efforts, or that in some way, I was slow-witted.\n[1971-05-16 20:00:00] Vomero | Sometimes, in front of Pietro, because of some hidden reasons, I attributed injustice to inequality, and I said it to him. I heard her say, \"You're acting as if all the students you're dealing with are the same, but that's not true. It's unreasonable to expect children who have different opportunities to achieve the same results.\"\n[1971-05-17 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself criticizing him because he told me he had an intense argument with a colleague who was at least twenty years older than him. I knew the man was a friend of his sister's, and I thought he could be teamed up with the conservative faction in the research institute to fight against them.\n[1971-05-17 20:05:00] Vomero | I know he had a conflict with this colleague because the man politely gave him advice, telling him not to be so strict with his students.\n[1971-05-17 20:10:00] Vomero | I knew Pietro wasn't being evasive; he politely countered that he didn't see himself as harsh, just very strict with his students.\n[1971-05-17 20:15:00] Vomero | I know, okay,\" the man said to him, \"then you shouldn't be so strict, especially with the students who are trying to fix this mess.\n[1971-05-17 20:20:00] Vomero | I didn't know what basis he had for saying those words, but their conversation was becoming increasingly unproductive. I thought about how Pietro usually spoke about these things briefly.\n[1971-05-17 20:25:00] New Home | I knew that at first, he felt it necessary to defend himself, and he just said that he respected all his students equally, treating them all the same.\n[1971-05-17 20:30:00] Vomero | I know he accused his colleagues of using two standards, two measures: being gentle with those tough students, but extremely ruthless with those who were afraid and timid, making them suffer humiliation.\n[1971-05-17 20:35:00] Vomero | I knew his colleague was angry, and finally he shouted at Pietro—because he knew Pietro's sister, something he had never wanted to say to him, but now he did—Pietro was an idiot, he didn't deserve to stand at the podium at all.\n[1971-05-17 20:40:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Can't you be more careful?\" \"I am being careful.\" \"I don't think so.\" \"Well, I have to say what's on my mind.\"\n[1971-05-17 20:41:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Maybe you should learn to tell who your friends are and who your enemies are.\" \"I don't have enemies.\" \"And I don't have friends either.\"\n[1971-05-17 20:45:00] Vomero | I saw you talking back and forth, and I began to exaggerate. I spoke to him word by word. \"I heard, 'If you do this, the end result will be that in this city, no one—let alone your parents' friends—will invite us to dinner, or to a concert, or on an outing.'\"\n[1971-05-18 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that in his work environment, Pietro was obviously considered a very dull person, quite different from his family, whose other members were all full of passion for politics. He was a failure in the Pietro family.\n[1971-05-18 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought I also agreed with this view, and it wasn't good for our shared life or our private relationship.\n[1971-05-18 22:00:00] Vomero | I saw Dede finally calm down, her schedule became regular again, Pietro had returned to our marital bed, but whenever he got close to me, I felt repulsed. I was afraid of another [pregnancy state].\n[1971-05-18 22:05:00] Vomero | I wanted to sleep in peace, so I silently pushed him away and turned around. If he kept insisting, pressing his body against my nightgown, I would gently kick his leg with my heel to make him understand: I didn't want it, and I was very tired.\n[1971-05-18 22:10:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro stop unhappily and get up to go study.\n[1971-06-01 20:00:00] Vomero | I remember one evening, we argued again about Clarissa—something we had done countless times before.\n[1971-06-01 20:05:00] Vomero | Every time I had to pay her, the atmosphere would get a bit tense, but that time was clearly different—Clelia was just an excuse. He muttered something under his breath. I heard, \"Elena, we need to talk about our relationship and find a balance.\"\n[1971-06-01 20:10:00] Vomero | I immediately agreed and told him that I admired his wisdom and refinement; Dede was also a wonderful child. I heard myself say, \"But I was going to say, I don't want any other children. My current state of isolation is unbearable, and I long to return to that active life I had before. I've been working hard since I was young, not to shut myself away, but just to play the role of a wife and mother.\"\n[1971-06-01 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw that we talked for a long time, I was very firm, and he was polite.\n[1971-06-01 21:30:00] Vomero | I saw that he no longer protested about the nanny and had made a concession; he decided to buy condoms and started inviting people over for dinner—people he didn't really have as friends, to be more precise, people he knew.\n[1971-06-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that, despite the increasing bloodshed on the streets, he agreed for me to take Dede with me to the meeting and the demonstration.",

When I took her out, she would get annoyed, throw a tantrum, tug at my ears, hair, and nose. She would cry and shout that she wanted Clelia.\n[1971-06-15 12:00:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that I was certain she would rather be with the girl from Maranna than with me.\n[1971-06-15 13:00:00] Vomero | I began to doubt myself: because I didn't breastfeed her, making her first year of life difficult, in her eyes I must have been a dark figure, a selfish and irritable woman who was always ready to shout at her. I resented the nanny's cheerful personality, and I was harsh toward her nanny—the girl who played with her and told her stories.\n[1971-06-15 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw that even when I was wiping her nose with a handkerchief, or removing food particles from her mouth, she would mechanically push me away. She would cry, saying that I was hurting her.\n[1971-06-15 23:00:00] Vomero\n[1971-06-15 23:10:00] Vomero | Sometimes I let him come from behind, because I feel that way the pain is a little less.\n[1971-06-15 23:20:00] Vomero | I saw him slamming into me, so I grabbed one of his hands and pulled it onto my body, hoping he would touch me. But he seemed unable to do two things at once; he liked the front part and immediately forgot about the back.\n[1971-06-15 23:25:00] Vomero | I thought that after he was satisfied, he seemed unable to notice that I longed for any part of his body to satisfy me.\n[1971-06-15 23:30:00] Vomero | I would run my fingers through your hair and whisper. I heard, \"I'll go do some work.\"\n[1971-06-15 23:31:00] Vomero | After I saw him leave, I felt that loneliness was a comfort and a reward.\n[1971-06-20 16:00:00] Parade procession | I sometimes looked at the young men in the procession with curious eyes. I thought they were fearless, ready to face any risk, full of joyful energy. When they sensed a threat, they became aggressive. I could feel their charm, and I felt that heat drawing me in.\n[1971-06-20 17:00:00] Parade procession | I thought, but I felt that I was completely different from those girls surrounding them. I had read too many books, wore glasses, was already married, and didn't have the time.\n[1971-06-20 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw that, and when I got home, I felt even worse. I was cold toward my husband, and I felt as if I had grown old.\n[1971-06-20 20:00:00] Vomero | I remember once, I was dreaming with my eyes open. I imagined one of these young men—famous and revered in Mergellina—who would find me, pull me over, just like when I was a girl, feeling clumsy and not wanting to dance, and Antonio or Pasquale would grab my arm and force me to dance.\n[1971-07-01 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw nature, and between me and those boys, nothing happened, but the people Pietro brought home caused me a lot of trouble.\n[1971-07-01 19:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself bent over preparing dinner for them, and also pretending to be an energetic hostess, finding topics to chat with them.\n[1971-07-01 20:00:00] Vomero | I had nothing to complain about, this was my request, I was the one who asked my husband to bring people home for dinner. I thought about it, but I quickly realized, to my discomfort, that those meals were not just simple gatherings.\n[1971-07-01 20:30:00] Vomero | I thought I would be attracted to any man who paid attention to me: tall or short, fat or thin, ugly or handsome, old or young, married or single.\n[1971-07-01 21:00:00] Vomero | If a man agreed with my point of view, if he remembered my books and said something complimentary, if he got excited by my intelligence, I would look at him with a very eager gaze, and in a short time, back and forth, he would think I was interested in him.\n[1971-07-01 21:30:00] Vomero | At this point, the man, who had started off dull and uninteresting, would become lively and eventually completely ignore Pietro, focusing all his attention on me.\n[1971-07-01 22:00:00] Vomero | I saw that every word he spoke, every action he took became ambiguous. As we talked, it grew more intimate. He would touch my shoulder with his fingertip, or brush my hand. He would look into my eyes and let out some exclamation. His knee would brush against mine, his toes against mine.\n[1971-07-01 22:30:00] Vomero | At moments like this, I always feel good; I forget about Pietro and Dede, as well as the very boring obligations that come with them.\n[1971-07-01 23:00:00] Vomero | I thought about how I was just worried that after the guests left, I would once again be trapped in this dark house, time passing away aimlessly, and I would feel lazy, along with anger hidden behind tenderness.\n[1971-07-01 23:10:00] Vomero | I saw it, so I was a bit exaggerated, my excitement made my voice get louder. I crossed my legs, trying to expose as much as possible, and with an effortless gesture, I unfastened one button of my shirt.\n[1971-07-01 23:20:00] Vomero | I saw that I was the one who had taken the initiative to draw closer to the guest. I thought that, as if a part of me was certain, by getting close to that stranger in this way, I would feel a little more at ease.\n[1971-07-01 23:30:00] Vomero | I felt this way: when he left the house—alone, or with his wife or lover—the comfortable sensation would stay in my body for a while, and I wouldn't feel so depressed. I wouldn't experience that emptiness that came after revealing my feelings and thoughts, nor the anxiety of failure.\n[1971-07-01 23:45:00] Vomero | I saw, actually, that after dinner, I was lying alone in bed while Pietro was studying. At that moment, I felt extremely foolish and looked down on myself.\n[1971-07-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't change myself. I thought about how those men were sure I had fallen for them, and they would usually call me the next day, making up excuses to meet me. I would agree.\n[1971-07-02 11:00:00] Meeting Place | I felt scared when I arrived at the meeting place. I can't stand the simple fact that they get so excited.\n[1971-07-02 11:10:00] Meeting place | I thought, for example, of someone thirty years older than me, or someone who was married, and the fact that they had developed feelings for me would erase their authority, erase the identity of savior I had given them.\n[1971-07-02 11:20:00] Meeting Place | I thought about the pleasure I had felt during the temptation, which had finally turned into a shameful mistake. I was confused as I asked myself: What exactly had happened? Why had I done it?\n[1971-07-02 12:00:00] Vomero | I saw the result, so I became more attentive to Dede and Pietro, but whenever I had the chance, I would start over again.\n[1971-07-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I don't read, nor do I write. I am full of imagination, and I turn the music up loud, listening to songs I didn't know as a child.\n[1971-07-15 11:00:00] Vomero | What especially annoyed me more and more was that, in the past, I had always been very disciplined in everything I did. I couldn't enjoy that kind of reckless happiness. The women my age, living in similar circumstances, seemed to fully embrace the present moment, and they also made others feel at ease around them.\n[1971-09-10 18:00:00] New Home | I saw, for example, that Mariarosa appeared at Mergellina several times. Sometimes she came to do research, sometimes to attend political meetings, and she would stay with us.\n[1971-09-10 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw that the men she brought each time were different. Sometimes she came with a girlfriend, and she used drugs, and also made her companions and us take them.\n[1971-09-10 19:30:00] Vomero | At that moment, Pietro would scowl and lock himself in the study.\n[1971-09-10 20:00:00] Vomero | I was captivated by her, of course I never tried smoking or hallucinogens—I was scared of feeling uncomfortable—but I would stay in the living room, chatting with her and her friends until late at night.\n[1971-09-10 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw them speak in all sorts of ways, sometimes with violence. I thought to myself, I have always strived to learn elegant language, but now it's out of date, too refined, too clean.\n[1971-09-10 21:30:00] Vomero | I thought about what Mariarosa's language had become now. I thought she had broken through the education she had received, and she had completely let go.\n[1971-09-10 21:31:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Damn! Where did I put my lighter?\" \"Damn! Where's my cigarette?\" I know that Pietro's sister was even more vulgar in her expressions than the things my sister Lina and I used to say when we were little. Every time she spoke, she started with a \"Fuck!\"\n[1971-09-10 21:32:00] Vomero | I thought about how Lina had always spoken like that. What should I do? Become like her again, and return to the starting point? Then why had I put in so much effort in the first place?\n[1971-09-10 22:00:00] Vomero | I looked at my sister-in-law, I liked the close relationship we had, and I also liked watching her make her brother feel embarrassed, as well as the men she brought home.\n[1971-09-10 22:10:00] Vomero | One night, I saw her suddenly stop talking and said to the young man who was with her. I heard, \"Enough, let's do it.\"\n[1971-09-10 22:15:00] Vomero | I saw that, all along, when Pietro spoke about this matter, he used a euphemism for a well-brought-up child, and I immediately adopted his phrasing, replacing the dirty word from the dialect I had used as a child.\n[1971-09-10 22:20:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, but now, I really feel that the world has changed. I have to say those dirty words, to say I want you to fuck me, to do it this way or that way? I can't imagine my husband would say such things.",

    "text": "[1971-09-10 22:30:00] New Home | I thought of the few men who had kept in touch with me. They were all very well-mannered, but they always enjoyed pretending to be rough types. They had a great time playing with women who pretended to be prostitutes, as if they really enjoyed treating a proper lady like a prostitute.\n[1971-09-10 23:00:00] New Home | At first, they were formal and restrained, but they couldn't wait to start arguing, turning unspoken words into spoken ones. Later, they kept talking endlessly, and it became a game of freedom.\n[1971-09-10 23:30:00] Vomero | I realized I had to try my best to go along with it. The more I adapted, the more I felt drawn in. There were times when I even thought I was falling in love. I thought that women's modesty was considered a sign of hypocrisy and stupidity, and that being open and straightforward was the quality a liberated woman should display.\n[1971-10-01 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know I first got involved in an affair with a teaching assistant who taught ancient Greek literature. He was my age, from Asti, and he had a girlfriend back in his hometown, whom he wasn't satisfied with.\n[1971-11-01 10:00:00] Mergellina | I know that later, I also had an affair with the husband of a female teacher who specialized in papyrus documents, though she wasn't on the payroll. She was in Catania, while her husband was in Mergellina, and they had two young children.\n[1971-11-01 10:05:00] Mergellina | I know his name is Mario, an engineer who teaches mechanical engineering. He has a thorough and authoritative understanding of politics. He has long hair and plays keyboard in a rock band in his spare time. He's seven years older than me.\n[1971-11-01 10:10:00] Mergellina | I know that my story with these two men followed the same pattern: Pietro invited them to dinner, I flirted with them, then there were phone calls, attending events together, long walks, movies—sometimes with Dede, sometimes just me.\n[1971-11-01 10:15:00] Mergellina | I recoiled the moment I saw the Greek literature teaching assistant clearly making his point.\n[1972-01-15 22:00:00] In Mario's car | I saw but Mario made it impossible for me to escape. One night, in his car, he did [intimate act] to me, for a long time, he touched my breasts under my underwear.\n[1972-01-16 10:00:00] New Home | I found it hard to push him away, so I said I never wanted to see him again, but he kept calling me, constantly, saying he missed me. I gave in.\n[1972-01-20 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that he had already [intimate act] with me, touched me, and he felt he had the right to continue what he had started. He kept insisting, passionately suggesting it again and again.\n[1972-01-20 10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw that on one hand I was tempting him, and on the other hand I was smiling as I stepped away. He pretended to be angry, and I got angry too.\n[1972-05-15 10:00:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw one morning, the three of us—me, him, and Dede—walking together. I know I remember, Dede was just over two years old then. She was very focused on playing with her doll, which she loved dearly and had named Tess.\n[1972-05-15 10:10:00] Street of Mergellina | I didn't pay much attention to her at the time; I was engrossed in my own language games and would sometimes forget she was even there.\n[1972-05-15 10:15:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw that as for Mario, he completely ignored the child's presence; all he wanted was to say some outrageous things to me.\n[1972-05-15 10:20:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw him whispering to Dede's ear, jokingly saying such things. I heard, \"Please tell your mother to be a little nicer to me.\"\n[1972-05-15 11:30:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw time fly by quickly, and later we parted ways. I walked home with Dede.\n[1972-05-15 11:35:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw her speak sharply after taking just a few steps. I heard \"Tess told me, it will tell Dad a secret.\"\n[1972-05-15 11:35:10] Street of Mergellina | I thought my heart was going to stop, Tess? Yes, what secret would it tell Papa? Tess knew, whether it was a good or bad thing? A bad thing.\n[1972-05-15 11:36:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw I had threatened her. I heard, \"Tell Tess that if it tells Dad about this, I'll lock it in the dark dressing room.\"\n[1972-05-15 11:37:00] Street of Mergellina | I saw her start to cry, I should have carried her home, but she kept walking to make me happy, pretending she wasn't the least bit tired.\n[1972-05-15 11:40:00] Street of Mergellina | I thought that therefore Dede understood, or at least felt, that between me and that man there was something her father could not tolerate.\n[1972-05-16 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had once again cut off contact with Mario. I wondered, fundamentally, what kind of person he really was? A bourgeois man addicted to lust.\n[1972-05-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I felt restless, my inner desire for infidelity was growing. I wanted to break free from myself, and at that moment, the whole world seemed to be breaking all the rules.\n[1972-05-20 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought about how I longed to step out of my marriage, even just once, oh! Why not? I wanted to get rid of everything in my life—everything I had learned, written, and would write, and the children I had brought into this world.\n[1972-05-20 10:10:00] Vomero | I was thinking, yes, marriage is a cage. Lina was a courageous woman; she broke free from that cage at the risk of her life.\n[1972-05-20 10:15:00] Vomero | What risk could I possibly take? Pietro was always away, always so careless. I had no real risks. What could possibly happen?\n[1972-05-20 15:00:00] Mario's Studio | I called Mario, entrusted Dede to Clelia, and went to his studio to find him.\n[1972-05-20 15:30:00] Mario's Studio | I saw us [intimate act], he [intimate act] my nipple, touched between my legs, just like Antonio had done by the pond many years ago.\n[1972-05-20 15:35:00] Mario's Studio | I saw him, but when he took off his pants and his underwear dropped to his knees, he grabbed the back of my neck and tried to push forward. At that moment, I broke free.\n[1972-05-20 15:36:00] Mario's Studio | I straightened my clothes and fled, I said. I heard \"No!\"\n[1972-05-20 16:00:00] Vomero | I thought about going home, and I was very excited, but my heart was full of guilt.\n[1972-05-20 22:00:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, what am I worried about? My period is coming soon, nothing will happen.\n[1972-06-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw, within a few weeks, that I was once again in a state of pregnancy. What I thought would not happen, happened.\n[1972-06-15 10:30:00] Vomero | I knew there was nothing to discuss with Pietro about abortion: I would have another child for him, and he'd be happy. I think about it, but I'm afraid of going through the process again. Just hearing the words \"childbirth state\" makes my stomach hurt.\n[1972-06-15 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw that in the phone call, Adele Airota mentioned abortion, but I immediately changed the subject, saying some vague things. I heard, \"Dede needs a companion. It's very lonely to grow up alone. It would be best to have her a little brother or sister.\"\n[1972-06-15 11:01:00] Vomero | I saw that I was lying. I heard, \"What about the book you were going to write?\" \"It's almost finished.\"\n[1972-06-15 11:02:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'You want to see it?' 'Of course.' 'We're all waiting.' 'I know.'\"\n[1972-06-15 12:00:00] Vomero | I thought of my panic, and without stopping to think, I did something astonishing that surprised Pietro, and even myself.\n[1972-06-15 12:05:00] Vomero | I called my mother and told her I was pregnant again, and I asked if she'd like to come stay at Mergellina for a while. She mumbled something. I heard, \"I can't come, I have to take care of your father and the several younger brothers and sisters.\"\n[1972-06-15 12:06:00] Vomero | I saw myself shouting at her. I heard, \"That means, because of you, I can't write anything anymore.\"\n[1972-06-15 12:07:00] Vomero | I saw her answer and I hung up the phone. I heard, \"This has nothing to do with me, aren't you satisfied being a rich lady?\"\n[1972-06-15 12:12:00] Vomero | I saw it, but five minutes later, Elisa called me and said. I heard, \"I'll take care of the house, Mom leaves tomorrow.\"",

    "text": "[1972-06-16 10:00:00] Train Station | I saw Pietro driving to the station to pick up my mother. I thought that would make her feel proud, making her feel deeply loved.\n[1972-06-16 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw her step into the house, and I immediately set a series of rules with her. I heard, \"Don't touch my room, and don't touch anything in Pietro's room; don't indulge Dede; don't interfere in my business with my husband.\"\n[1972-06-16 11:01:00] Vomero | I heard, \"You must urge Clelia to work, but also get along with her; you must treat me as a stranger, and under no circumstances disturb me; when there are guests, you should either stay in the kitchen or in your room.\"\n[1972-06-20 10:00:00] New Home | I thought I was certain that she wouldn't follow any of my instructions, but in just a few days, she became a very loyal servant, as if leaving the San Gregorio Armeno house had changed her true nature.\n[1972-06-20 11:00:00] Vomero | I watched her manage everything at home, dealing with all kinds of problems decisively and efficiently, never disturbing me or Pietro.\n[1972-07-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I sometimes see her return to San Gregorio Armeno. When she's gone, I find it hard to deal with a lot of things. I'm afraid she'll never come back, but she always does.\n[1972-07-01 11:00:00] New Home | I saw her telling me the news about Mergellina. I know that Pinocchia is pregnant. Pinocchia had a son, and Giggia gave Michele a second son. To avoid conflict, she never mentioned Lina.\n[1972-07-01 12:00:00] Vomero | After that, she became a ghost-like figure in the house. She washed everyone's clothes clean and ironed them perfectly, cooked the meals I loved as a child, and kept the whole house always clean and tidy. If anything was disturbed, she would immediately put it back in order.\n[1972-07-15 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro once again thinking about firing Clelia, and my mother agreed with him. I was angry, but instead of arguing with my husband, I took my anger out on my mother.\n[1972-07-15 20:30:00] Vomero | I saw her go into her room without saying a word.\n[1972-07-15 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro scold me, he tried hard to reconcile me with my mother, and we both went along with it.\n[1972-07-15 21:30:00] Vomero | I saw that he appreciated my mother. He said she was a smart woman, and he often kept her company in the kitchen, chatting with her after dinner.\n[1972-07-15 22:00:00] Vomero | I saw Dede call her grandmother, and they were so close that when Clelia arrived, she would sometimes become impatient.\n[1972-08-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself forcing myself to focus on writing the book. I thought of it, I said to myself, everything is all set, I have no more excuses.\n[1972-08-01 10:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself looking at the notes I had written. I thought to myself that I was certain, I should change my approach. I wanted to put aside those stories that Franco Mari defined as \"small loves and little affections,\" and I wanted to write about something closer to reality: demonstrations in the square, violence, death, police repression, and the fear of the military government.\n[1972-08-05 10:00:00] Vomero | I had written more than a dozen pages unwillingly, and then there was nothing more.\n[1972-08-05 11:00:00] Vomero | I wondered what exactly I was missing. It was hard to say. Maybe it was San Gregorio Armeno, our Mergellina, or perhaps an image like The Blue Fairy, or maybe passion—a voice that could guide me and give me authority.\n[1972-08-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I see myself sitting at the desk, time passing by in vain, I read some novels, but I never go out of the room. I thought I was scared that Dede would keep clinging to me.\n[1972-08-10 11:00:00] Vomero | I heard the child's cries in the hallway, Clelia's voice, and my mother's limping footsteps. I thought to myself that I really felt very unhappy.\n[1972-08-10 11:05:00] Vomero | I saw myself lifting my skirt, looking at my already slightly rounded belly, and I felt a wave of pleasure throughout my body. I thought about the time I felt full again, but at the same time, I also felt empty.\n[1972-09-01 10:00:00] New Home | I started calling Lina during that time, but not the way I used to, calling her occasionally. Instead, I called her every day. I thought about calling her with an extremely expensive long-distance call, my only purpose being to hide in her shadow, to let the time of [childbearing state] pass, I hoped she would stir my imagination as she had before.\n[1972-09-01 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw, of course, I was very careful and never said anything that shouldn't be said, I hoped she did the same. I realized clearly that, by now, if our friendship was to continue, we both had to learn to keep our mouths shut.\n[1972-09-01 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought, for example, that I couldn't tell her about the dark side of my heart: I was afraid that even from a distance, she might bring disaster, and sometimes I even wished she would really get sick and die; for example, she couldn't tell me the real reason why she often treated me so rudely.\n[1972-09-01 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw that, so we just talked about Gennaro, who's in elementary school and already one of the best students in his class; and Dede, who has already learned to read. I thought about how we were like two ordinary mothers, proud of our own children.\n[1972-09-01 10:20:00] Vomero | I would talk to her about my attempts at writing, but I never exaggerated, I just said. \"I'm writing, it's not that simple. After [pregnancy], my energy isn't as strong anymore.\"\n[1972-09-01 10:25:00] Vomero | I saw or tried to figure out whether Michele was still circling around her, making her talk about herself, spending more time with her.\n[1972-09-01 10:30:00] Vomero | I would sometimes ask her if she liked certain actors in movies or on TV, trying to get her to tell me whether men who were different from Enzo might attract her. I wanted to tell her that I, too, was attracted to some men different from Pietro, but I felt she wasn't interested in the last topic.\n[1972-09-01 10:35:00] Vomero | I saw that whenever I mentioned those actors, she would always say. \"I heard, 'Who is it? I've never seen them in any movies or TV shows.'\"\n[1972-09-01 10:40:00] Vomero | I knew that if I mentioned Enzo, she would start talking to me about IBM System, bringing up a bunch of technical terms I didn't understand, leaving me completely confused.\n[1972-09-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that they were all passionate conversations. Sometimes I thought that the things she said might be useful to me in the future, so I took notes while she was speaking.\n[1972-09-02 10:05:00] Vomero | I know Enzo succeeded; he's now working at a small factory fifty kilometers away from San Gregorio Armeno, which produces bedding.\n[1972-09-02 10:10:00] Vomero | I know the factory rented a IBM System machine, and he worked there as a programmer, turning those processes into code.\n[1972-09-02 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw that the mainframe of the machine was as big as a three-door wardrobe, with 8 kb of memory, and it was extremely hot.\n[1972-09-02 10:20:00] New Home | I heard, \"Elena, you can't imagine: IBM System is hotter than a furnace, those are all extremely abstract things, mixed with sweat and stench.\"\n[1972-09-02 10:25:00] Vomero | I saw her talking about the ferrochrome core. I know there are cables passing through the iron rings, and the voltage determines the rotation, 0 or 1, a single ring is a bit, and eight rings grouped together make a byte.\n[1972-09-02 10:30:00] Vomero | Whenever Enzo is mentioned, Lina can't stop talking.\n[1972-09-02 10:35:00] New Home | I saw him in a room with a large air conditioner, manipulating these languages. I thought of him as a god in this field, like a hero who could make machines do everything that people could do.\n[1972-09-02 10:40:00] Vomero | I saw her occasionally asking me, and I would timidly respond. I heard, \"Can you understand?\" \"I do.\" I thought about it, but I really didn't know what she was talking about.\n[1972-09-02 10:41:00] Vomero | I thought about how I felt she also realized I understood nothing at all, which made me feel ashamed.",

    "text": "[1972-09-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that, in the long-distance calls I made, her enthusiasm grew each time. I know Enzo now earns fourteen thousand eight hundred lira a month, fourteen thousand eight hundred! That's exactly how much, because he's very capable, he's the smartest man I've ever met.\n[1972-09-10 10:05:00] Vomero | I knew he was very capable, with a sharp mind, and he quickly became an essential part of the company. Enzo had the company hire her as his assistant, which was the biggest news: Lina was working again, and this time she really liked her job.\n[1972-09-10 10:10:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Elena, Enzo is the leader, and I'm the assistant. I have my mother take care of Gennaro. Sometimes I even have Stefano take care of Gennaro. I go to the factory every morning.\"\n[1972-09-10 10:15:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Me and Enzo gradually studied the company. We worked just like those employees, researching what to input into the computer.\"\n[1972-09-10 10:20:00] Vomero | I heard, \"We made many breakthroughs, doing those financial statements, we put labels on the invoices, verifying the apprentices' logbooks and attendance cards, then turning everything into patterns and cards.\"\n[1972-09-10 10:25:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes, yes, I also do punching, I do it with other women, they give me eight thousand lira.\"\n[1972-09-10 10:30:00] New Home | I heard myself say, \"Fourteen thousand eight hundred plus eight thousand, together we made twenty-two thousand eight hundred lira, Elena! Me and Enzo are now rich men, and in a few months it'll be even better because the boss realized how capable I am and wants to train me. Look at my life now, are you happy?\"\n[1972-10-01 20:00:00] Vomero | I remember one night, it was her who called me. She said she had heard some terrible news. I heard, \"Dario was killed, right there in the Jesus Square at the school gate.\"\n[1972-10-01 20:05:00] Vomero | I knew Dario was a union member, the student she had mentioned before, the boy who was handing out flyers in front of Via Caracciolo.\n[1972-10-01 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw and felt that she was very worried. She talked to me about the dark clouds hovering over Mergellina and the entire city, and there had been many violent incidents.\n[1972-10-01 20:15:00] Vomero | I saw her say that the gang fights were orchestrated by Fascist member Gino, and behind Gino was Michele, and when she mentioned these names, she was filled with old and new grudges. I thought that behind all these things, there were still many things she hadn't said.\n[1972-10-01 20:20:00] Vomero | I thought to myself: How could she be so sure it was them? Maybe she still kept in touch with those students on the way to court, maybe her life wasn't just about studying IBM System with Enzo.\n[1972-10-01 20:25:00] Vomero | I realized I had been listening to her all along without interrupting her, as she once again described everything with vivid detail, just like always.\n[1972-10-01 20:30:00] Vomero | I saw her and she told me a lot of details. She said a group of fascists had set out from the new Fascist branch across from the elementary school, spread out in the Rettifilo district, and arrived at the city hall square. They climbed onto Piazza del Plebiscito, and attacked members of Communist Party with knives and iron rods.\n[1972-10-01 20:35:00] Vomero | I saw Pasquale attacked twice, they knocked out his teeth, and one night at the main gate, Enzo and Gino themselves fought.\n[1972-10-01 20:40:00] Vomero | I saw her stop, and she changed her tone, asking me, \"Do you remember, when we were kids, the atmosphere of Mergellina?\"\n[1972-10-01 20:45:00] Vomero | I saw her mention her father-in-law, Don Achille, the usurer and Fascist member, and Peruzzo, the carpenter, things that happened right before our eyes, she said. I heard, \"Back then it was worse, probably just as terrifying.\"\n[1972-10-01 20:50:00] Vomero | I saw that from that moment on, we gradually returned to that era. I remembered some details, and she mentioned others.\n[1972-10-01 20:55:00] Vomero | I read until the end, and Lina's sentences became more vivid, just like when she was a child, she described the scene of Don Achille's murder. There were some factual fragments, but also a lot of her imagination: Achille's neck was cut, blood splattered far and wide, splashing onto a copper pot.\n[1972-10-01 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw, as before, that she still didn't think it was the carpenter. She said, in her opinion, the law back then was like the law today, always just skimming the surface, so they had judged the carpenter to be the culprit.\n[1972-10-01 21:05:00] Vomero | I saw it all, and she sighed. I heard, \"Who can guarantee that it was Pinocchia and Pasquale's father? Who can say whether the murderer was a man or a woman?\"\n[1972-10-01 21:10:00] Vomero | I saw it just like the game we used to play when we were kids, we were truly a perfect team, my voice grew more and more excited. I thought about how we—two little girls back then, two mature women now—are together unraveling a mystery that has remained unsolved for over twenty years.\n[1972-10-01 21:15:00] Vomero | I saw her ask. I heard, \"Think about it, who really benefited from the murder, who took over Don Achille's place and became the number one loan shark?\"\n[1972-10-01 21:16:00] Vomero | I saw, yes, who is it? We both got the same answer at the same time. I heard, \"The only one who benefited was the woman with the red notebook—Manuela, mother of Marcello and Michele.\"\n[1972-10-01 21:17:00] Vomero | I heard us shouting loudly: \"It was her who killed Don Achille.\" Then we both muttered, first me, then her. \"I heard, 'What are we even talking about? Let's not talk about that. We're still those two little girls, never growing up.'\"\n[1972-10-01 21:30:00] Vomero | I thought about it until finally, I felt a little better. For a long time, we couldn't reach the same wavelength, but this time, it was the silence between us over the phone line that carried our understanding. We hadn't seen each other for a long time.\n[1972-10-01 21:35:00] Vomero | I thought about how she had never seen me after I gave birth to two children. I didn't know, had she remained as pale and thin as before, or had her figure changed.\n[1972-10-01 21:36:00] Vomero | I thought about these years, and I felt like I was talking to an image in my mind, and her voice couldn't fully represent that image.\n[1972-10-01 21:37:00] Vomero | I thought perhaps it was because of this, and suddenly I felt that the murder of Don Achille was a fascinating story, one that could become the core of my new novel.\n[1972-10-01 22:00:00] Vomero | After hanging up, I immediately started putting together what we had discussed.\n[1972-10-01 22:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself reconstructing the things Lina had reminded me of, blending past and present, from the murder of poor Dario to the death of the usurer, all the way to Manuela.\n[1972-10-01 23:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I couldn't sleep, endlessly thinking over the things she had said. I thought to myself that I was becoming increasingly clear about it: through these materials, I could tell a story.\n[1972-10-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that in the following days, I kept reflecting on Mergellina and San Gregorio Armeno, blending the current turbulent situation with distant voices.\n[1972-10-02 12:00:00] New Home | I thought about my current wealthy and comfortable life, and the efforts I had made to escape my origins. The worries about losing everything before me, and the desire to go back, all mixed together in my heart.\n[1972-10-02 14:00:00] New Home | I had thought about it over and over again, and the more I did, the more certain I became that I could write a book about these events.",

    "text": "[1972-10-02 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself struggling very hard to think, while recalling many painful memories. I filled my notebook with notes, constructing a violent plot that connected events from the past two decades.\n[1972-10-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw Lina sometimes call me, asking me. I heard, \"You haven't called for a long time, are you sick?\" \"I'm fine, I'm working on something.\"\n[1972-10-15 10:01:00] Vomero | I heard, \"When you write, I don't exist?\" \"You do exist, but you distract me.\" \"What if I get sick? What if I need you?\" \"You can call me.\"\n[1972-10-15 10:02:00] New Home | \"I heard you say, 'If I don't call you, you'll just be thinking about your novel?' 'Yes.' 'I'm jealous of you, you're so lucky.'\"\n[1972-11-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself writing with increasing anxiety. I thought about how I was worried I wouldn't finish the book before the child was born, and I feared I might die during childbirth, leaving behind an unfinished book.\n[1972-11-01 11:00:00] Vomero | I thought this book was completely different from my first one, which had been written casually and effortlessly. This one was very difficult.\n[1973-02-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that as soon as I finished the draft, I began revising it very carefully. I thought about wanting to write with a brand-new, thrilling, meticulously constructed chaos, and I did so without hesitation.\n[1973-04-01 10:00:00] New Home | I saw that when I wrote it a second time, I used a meticulous approach, revising each line again and again.\n[1973-06-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I was glad there was carbon paper; I turned my novel into three copies, each almost two hundred pages long, with no printing errors. I know it's thanks to my Olivetti \"Lettera 32\" typewriter, which I bought while I was pregnant with Dede.\n[1973-07-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that my stomach was big, and the pain in my hips had started again, recurring endlessly. I saw that it was summer, and the weather was very hot.\n[1973-07-01 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself staring at the papers, realizing I was terrified. The sound of my mother pacing back and forth in the corridor annoyed me.\n[1973-07-15 10:00:00] Vomero | For several days, I couldn't make a decision. I wanted Pietro to read it, but I was hesitant.\n[1973-07-15 11:00:00] Vomero | I thought, maybe I should just send it to Adele Airota so she could see it. Pietro wasn't suitable for reading such stories, and besides, he had always been so sensitive, which made his days in the department very difficult.\n[1973-07-15 11:30:00] Vomero | I saw that every time he came home, he was anxious, and he would say some abstract things to me, all about the value of law.\n[1973-07-15 12:00:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, his condition wasn't suitable for reading a story about workers, bosses, bloody struggles, the underworld, and loan sharks.\n[1973-07-15 12:30:00] New Home | I thought of something else— he had always kept me away from the turmoil inside him. He never showed any interest in what I had been like before, or what I had become later. He wasn't even interested in me as a person. What was the point of showing him the book?\n[1973-07-15 13:00:00] Vomero | I thought he would only talk about words and the use of punctuation; if I asked for his thoughts, he would only say a few vague things.\n[1973-07-23 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had sent a manuscript to Adele Airota, and I called her, saying. I heard, \"I'm finished.\"\n[1973-07-23 10:05:00] New Home | \"I'm really glad. Let me see it?\" \"I sent you a copy this morning.\" \"Good, I can't wait to see your new work.\"\n[1973-07-24 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself waiting, a waiting more anxious than when I had waited for the child kicking inside me to be born.\n[1973-07-28 10:00:00] Vomero | I watched my days slip away one by one. Five days had passed, and Adele Airota still hadn't replied.\n[1973-07-29 19:00:00] Vomero | On the sixth day, during dinner, Dede started eating by herself to please me, though it was very difficult. Her grandmother longed to feed her personally, but she restrained herself from helping.\n[1973-07-29 19:30:00] Vomero | I was watching when Pietro asked me. I heard, \"Have you finished your writing?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why did you let my mother read it but not me?\"\n[1973-07-29 19:31:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'You're always busy, I don't want to bother you. If you want to see it, there's a copy on my desk.'\"\n[1973-07-29 19:32:00] Vomero | I saw that he didn't answer, so I waited a moment and then asked. I heard, \"Adele Airota, you told her, right?\" \"Who else could it be?\" \"Did she read it?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1973-07-29 19:33:00] Vomero | I heard, \"What does she think?\" \"She'll tell you. It's between the two of you.\"\n[1973-07-29 20:00:00] Vomero | After dinner, I put the manuscript from my table onto his desk. I thought the situation was bad.\n[1973-07-29 22:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had put Dede to sleep. I was watching TV all along, but I didn't really see or hear anything. Finally, I lay down on the bed.\n[1973-07-30 02:00:00] Vomero | I couldn't fall asleep: why had Adele Airota already talked to Pietro about my book, and why hadn't she called me yet?\n[1973-07-30 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw the next day—July 30, 1973. I went to check if my husband had started reading my novel, but the manuscript was already buried under a pile of books, the ones he had been studying all night. Clearly, he hadn't even flipped through my manuscript.\n[1973-07-30 10:00:00] Vomero | I got really annoyed and yelled at Clelia, telling her to watch Dede and stop always putting her hands in her pockets, doing nothing, while all the work fell to my mother.\n[1973-07-30 10:30:00] Vomero | I saw how unkind I was to my mother, because she thought that by saying that, I was showing her goodwill.\n[1973-07-30 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw her touching my stomach, trying to calm me down. She asked. I heard, \"If you had another daughter, what would you name her?\"\n[1973-07-30 11:01:00] Vomero | I knew I was thinking about something else, my legs hurt a lot, and without even thinking, I answered her. I heard \"Elsa.\"\n[1973-07-30 11:02:00] Vomero | I saw her face grow dark. I later realized that what she had expected me to say was: we gave Dede the name of Pietro's mother, and if we have another daughter this time, we'll use your name.\n[1973-07-30 11:03:00] New Home | I said, trying to find a reason for myself, but not very actively. \"I heard, 'Mom, think about it, your name is Immacolata, I can't give my daughter that name, I don't like it.'\"\n[1973-07-30 11:04:00] New Home | I saw her mutter, \"Why, Elsa sounds better?\" I said, \"Elsa is like Elisa, the name of my sister. You should be happy about that.\" She never said another word.\n[1973-07-30 11:30:00] New Home | I saw that I was tired of everything at that time. I thought about how the weather was getting hotter and hotter, and I was always drenched in sweat. My stomach felt heavy and unbearable, and I couldn't stand the way I limped around. Everything was unbearable.\n[1973-07-30 12:00:00] Vomero | I finally called Adele Airota before lunch, and her voice didn't have its usual teasing tone.\n[1973-07-30 12:05:00] Vomero | I saw her speaking very slowly, her tone was heavy, and I felt each word was a struggle for her. I thought of how she had expressed it with roundabout, ambiguous words: \"The book wasn't very good.\"\n[1973-07-30 12:10:00] New Home | When I tried to defend the novel, she no longer used polite words to hide her true feelings, but became very direct.",

    "text": "[1973-07-30 12:11:00] Vomero | I saw her say it. I heard people say, \"The female lead is really annoying; there's no standout character, just some vague shadows; the scenes and dialogue in the book are all clichés; the novel tries to be fashionable but ends up looking messy; the hatred in the story is really uncomfortable; the ending is also rough, with a bit of an Italian western feel, failing to show your intelligence, culture, and talent.\"\n[1973-07-30 12:12:00] Vomero | I saw it all, and I could only keep silent. I had been listening very carefully to her criticism all along.\n[1973-07-30 12:13:00] Vomero | I saw her conclude at last. I heard, \"The previous novel was alive and fresh, but this one is old-fashioned, written with such carefully chosen language, yet it looks hollow.\"\n[1973-07-30 12:13:30] Vomero | I said quietly, \"Maybe the publishers will be a bit more lenient.\" Her tone became stiff as she replied. I heard, \"If you want to show it to them, you can try, but I'm sure they won't think the book is worth publishing.\"\n[1973-07-30 12:14:00] Vomero | I didn't know what to say, so I mumbled, \"Okay, I'll think about it, goodbye.\" But she still wanted to talk, so she changed her tone and started speaking with warmth about Dede, my mother, my unborn child, and Mariarosa, who had really angered her.\n[1973-07-30 12:15:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'Why didn't you show your novel to Pietro?' 'I didn't know.' 'He would have given you some advice.' 'I doubt it.' 'You don't expect anything from him at all?' 'Yes.'\"\n[1973-07-30 12:30:00] Vomero | I saw that after making the call, I locked myself in my room, feeling extremely desperate. I thought it was a deeply humiliating thing, something I couldn't stand.\n[1973-07-30 13:00:00] Vomero | I didn't eat much for lunch, and even though it was hot, I closed the windows and took a nap.\n[1973-07-30 16:00:00] New Home | At four o'clock in the afternoon, I felt the first wave of pain.\n[1973-07-30 16:30:00] Street of Mergellina | I didn't tell my mother, I took the bag I had prepared in advance and sat down at the car's steering wheel, driving toward the clinic. I thought I wished I would die on the road, with my second child, but everything went smoothly.\n[1973-07-30 20:00:00] Clinic | I felt a wave of intense pain, and within a few hours, I gave birth to another daughter.\n[1973-07-31 09:00:00] Clinic | I saw that the next morning, Pietro started saying that the child should be given my mother's name. I thought to myself, it was only right that my mother had worked so hard.\n[1973-07-31 09:30:00] Clinic | I saw myself repeating again and again that the child's name was already decided, it was Elsa. I thought about how I felt at the time, annoyed by the tradition of keeping such promises.\n[1973-08-05 10:00:00] Vomero | I did the first thing when I got back home from the clinic was call Lina.\n[1973-08-05 10:05:00] Vomero | I realized I hadn't told her that I had just given birth, and I asked her if I could send her the novel.\n[1973-08-05 10:06:00] Vomero | I saw for a few seconds, I only heard her light breathing, and then she said. I heard, \"I'll read it after it's published.\"\n[1973-08-05 10:07:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'I need your opinion right now.' 'I haven't read a book in a long time, Elena, I don't know how to read anymore, I can't do it.'\"\n[1973-08-05 10:08:00] New Home | I heard, \"Just please do it.\" \"You published the previous one right away, why not this one?\" \"Because last time I didn't think it was a book.\"\n[1973-08-05 10:09:00] Vomero | \"I can only tell you, do I like it or not.\" \"Well, that's enough.\"\n[1973-08-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I was waiting for Lina to finish reading my novel when news came that San Gregorio Armeno had erupted with cholera.\n[1973-08-20 12:00:00] Vomero | I saw my mother was very uneasy, her reaction was somewhat exaggerated. She became distracted, and in the end, she broke one of my favorite soup bowls. She said she was going home.\n[1973-08-20 12:05:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that I had immediately realized, if the cholera was one reason, then my refusal to name my second daughter after her was another important reason.\n[1973-08-20 12:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself trying to hold her back, but she still left. I knew that at the time, I had just given birth and hadn't recovered yet, and my leg pain hadn't gone away either.\n[1973-08-20 12:15:00] Vomero | I thought she could no longer stand spending month after month on me, and I was such an ungrateful, disrespectful daughter, so she would rather be with her husband and a few good children, facing the risk of cholera.\n[1973-08-20 12:30:00] Vomero | I watched her all the way to the door. She didn't shout, didn't complain, didn't say anything about me—completely expressionless.\n[1973-08-20 12:40:00] Vomero | I saw that she was happy to have Pietro drive her to the train station. I thought that she must feel her son-in-law loved her, and I thought, she had always been patient, perhaps not to please me, but to avoid embarrassment in front of my husband.\n[1973-08-20 12:45:00] Staircase of the New Home | When I saw her separate from Dede, I felt very reluctant. In the stairwell, she asked the child in effortful Italian. I heard, \"Grandma is leaving, are you sad?\"\n[1973-08-20 12:46:00] Staircase of the New Home | I saw her say, \"Not sad at all.\" I thought that Dede's departure was a betrayal.\n[1973-08-20 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw it several hours later, driven by a self-destructive frenzy, and I fired Clelia. I was angry at my mother, but I was even angrier at myself.\n[1973-08-20 16:30:00] Vomero | I was surprised to see Pietro, but he was also cautious.\n[1973-08-20 17:00:00] Vomero | I said, I'm bored. \"I heard that 'Dede has a Marémola accent, and now adding my mother's San Gregorio Armeno accent, it's really unbearable.'\"\n[1973-08-20 18:00:00] Vomero | I thought that now I had to become the master of the house, to take care of the children myself. But in reality, I felt filled with guilt, and I wanted to punish myself. I became addicted to a desperate idea: that I would be overwhelmed by the two children, the household chores, and my painful leg.\n[1973-08-25 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that I was certain Elsa would make me have an extremely terrifying year, just like Dede did.\n[1973-09-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but maybe because I had already gained experience in taking care of babies, or perhaps because I had already accepted that I was a bad mother, I didn't demand perfection. As a result, the baby started nursing smoothly, always quietly, for long periods of time, then slept for a long while.\n[1973-09-01 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I would also sleep for a long time.\n[1973-09-05 10:00:00] Vomero | In the first few days after I came home, to my surprise, Pietro would clean the house thoroughly, go shopping, cook meals, bathe Elsa, and comfort Dede—Grandma had passed away, and now there was another little sister, which left her a bit confused.\n[1973-09-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that the pain in my leg had suddenly gone away, and I felt much calmer.\n[1973-09-15 15:00:00] Vomero | I was lying in bed on a afternoon, half awake and half asleep, when my husband came over and woke me up, saying, \"Your friend San Gregorio Armeno is calling you.\" I rushed to answer the phone.\n[1973-09-15 15:05:00] New Home | I saw Lina talking to me for a long time about Pietro, she said. I heard, \"I can't wait to meet Pietro himself.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself listening somewhat carelessly. I thought that Pietro was kind to everyone who didn't belong to his parents' world.\n[1973-09-15 15:15:00] Vomero | I saw Lina avoiding the issue, talking for a long time. I thought that the cheerful tone she used concealed her anxiety.\n[1973-09-15 15:20:00] Vomero | I thought I was about to shout at her: \"I've given you the power to hurt me as much as possible. Hurry up, say it. That book has been in your hands for thirteen days—tell me your thoughts already.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:21:00] Vomero | I saw it, but I didn't shout. I just suddenly cut her off and asked. I heard, \"Did you finally read that book?\"\n[1973-09-15 15:21:30] Vomero | I saw her tone become very serious. I heard, \"I read it.\" \"Then what?\" \"It's well written.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:22:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'How so? Do you think it's interesting? Fun or boring?' 'I think it's interesting.' 'A little interesting, or very interesting?' 'Very interesting.'\"\n[1973-09-15 15:22:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Why?\" \"The story is very interesting, it makes you want to keep reading.\" \"Then what?\" \"Then what?\"\n[1973-09-15 15:23:00] Vomero | I saw that I was getting a bit impatient, I said. \"I heard 'Lina, I must know, how are the things I've written? No one can tell me, except you.' 'I'm telling you,' I said.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:23:30] Vomero | I said it, and I saw it. I heard, \"No, you're not telling the truth, you're lying to me. Before, no matter what we talked about, you were never this shallow.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:24:00] Vomero | I saw her remain silent for a long time. I imagined her sitting with her legs crossed, on an ugly little table, with a phone on the table. Maybe she and Enzo had just finished work and come back, while Gennaro was playing not far away.\n[1973-09-15 15:25:00] Vomero | I saw her say. I heard, \"I've already told you, I can't read anymore.\" \"That's not the issue. The problem is that I need you, but you don't care about me at all.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:26:00] Vomero | I saw her fall into silence again for a while, muttering some words I couldn't understand, maybe a curse.\n[1973-09-15 15:26:30] Vomero | I saw her speak in an unyielding, resentful tone. I heard, \"I do one job, you do another. What advice could I give you? You went to school, you know how a book should be written.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:27:00] Vomero | I saw later, her voice suddenly changed, and she was almost shouting. \"I shouldn't have written these things, Elena! This isn't you. The things you showed me—none of them look like you. This is a terrible, terrible book. The previous one was bad too.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:27:30] Vomero | I saw her speaking quickly, her voice choked, out of breath. I thought of how her light breath suddenly became heavy, congealing together, unable to enter or leave her throat.\n[1973-09-15 15:28:00] Vomero | I saw my stomach twist with pain, and the pain in my belly kept getting worse. I thought not because of what she said, but because of the way she said it.\n[1973-09-15 15:28:30] Vomero | Did I see her crying? I said uneasily. I heard, \"Lina, what's wrong? Calm down, take a deep breath.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:29:00] Vomero | I saw her, but she didn't calm down. She was really crying, and I heard the pain in her sobs.\n[1973-09-15 15:29:30] Vomero | I saw her say. \"I heard, 'It's terrible, Elena, very, very terrible, the first book was too—'\" I thought of the book that sold many copies, the one that made me successful. About that book, she never said anything, and now she says it was a failure.\n[1973-09-15 15:30:00] Vomero | The thing that made me suffer was her crying. I wasn't prepared for it, and I hadn't expected her to cry. I preferred the bad Lina, the one with that evil tone. But now she was sobbing, unable to stop.\n[1973-09-15 15:31:00] Vomero | I thought I was confused, I said to myself, I've written two terrible books, but what does that matter? This pain is far more serious.\n[1973-09-15 15:32:00] Vomero | I muttered something to myself. I heard, \"Lina, why are you crying? I should be the one crying, don't cry anymore.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:32:30] Vomero | I saw it, but she said sharply. I heard, \"Why did you make me read this book? Why did you force me to say what's in my heart? I just wanted to know it myself.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:33:00] Vomero | I saw myself saying the answer. I heard, \"Don't do this, I swear to you, you can tell me, I'm happy.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:33:30] Vomero | I tried to make her calm down, but I couldn't. She said some confusing things. I heard, \"Don't make me read anything else, I'm not suited for it.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:34:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'I have high expectations for you, I'm very sure you can do well. I hope you do better, that's what I most desire. If you're not really good, then who am I? Who am I, really?'\"\n[1973-09-15 15:35:00] Vomero | I saw and whispered to her. I heard, \"Don't worry, you have to tell me what you're thinking. Only like that can you help me. From childhood, you've always been helping me. Without you, I can't do anything.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:36:00] Vomero | I watched until she finally stopped crying, sniffling and saying a few words. I heard, \"Why am I crying? I'm such a fool.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:36:30] Vomero | I saw her smile and say. I heard, \"I didn't want to make you uncomfortable. I prepared a whole dialogue of praise, and I even wrote it down. I wanted to leave you with a good impression.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:37:00] Vomero | I told her to send me the review, I said. I heard, \"Perhaps you know better than I do what I should write.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:38:00] Vomero | I saw, and then we stopped talking about the novel. I told her that Elsa had been born, and we talked about Mergellina, San Gregorio Armeno, and cholera. She spoke in a mocking tone. I heard, \"What cholera? There's no cholera here, just the usual mess. People are worried about dying from diarrhea, but actually there's nothing to worry about. It's mostly fear, nothing at all.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:38:30] Vomero | I heard, \"We ate a lot of lemons, but no one got sick.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:39:00] Vomero | I saw that when she mentioned these things, she spoke smoothly, almost happily, as if she had rid herself of a burden. I thought about the outcome, and once again I felt myself sinking into a vortex—two young daughters, a husband who was never around, and a terrible work.\n[1973-09-15 15:40:00] Vomero | I thought that although it was like this, I didn't feel uneasy at all, but rather felt relieved. It was me who had made her say about my failure.\n[1973-09-15 15:41:00] Vomero | I thought of a sentence that came to my mind: The positive bond you brought into my life has broken, like a rope that has snapped, and now I am truly alone.\n[1973-09-15 15:42:00] Vomero | I saw it but didn't tell her, I said it in a self-mocking tone. \"I heard 'I struggled very hard to write this book in order to settle accounts with the Mergellina where I was born. The book tells about the huge changes happening around me, changes that prompted me to write this book—the story of Don Achille and the mother of the Solara brothers.'\"\n[1973-09-15 15:43:00] Vomero | I saw her laughing and she said. I heard, \"These repulsive faces aren't enough for a novel: without imagination, they don't look real, just like masks.\"\n[1973-09-15 15:45:00] Vomero | I couldn't figure out why, and later I tried to sort out that phone call and the impact of Lina's sobs, but I found it hard to analyze clearly.\n[1973-09-15 15:45:10] Vomero | I thought that if I looked deeper, she seemed to be expressing a somewhat contradictory compliment to me. It was as if her crying affirmed her feelings for me and her trust in my abilities, finally erasing her negative comments about my two books.",

    "text": "[1973-09-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I realized only a few days later that her sobs had allowed her to destroy my work without saying it outright, and to escape my anger.\n[1973-09-20 10:00:10] Vomero | I thought, and she set me a very high goal—not to disappoint her, making it impossible for me to try writing anything else.\n[1973-09-20 10:00:20] Vomero | I think about it, but I need to say again: no matter how many times I re-examine our call, I can't say that this phone call was the beginning of this or that event, nor was it the most intimate, or perhaps the most sordid, exchange between us.\n[1973-09-20 10:00:30] Vomero | I thought, of course, the mirror effect of Lina was intensified, making her even more prominent in highlighting my incompetence. In this way, I felt I could accept my failure more easily, as if Lina's opinion was more authoritative, more emotional, and more convincing than that of my mother-in-law.\n[1973-09-22 16:00:00] Vomero | I actually called Adele Airota a few days later and told her. I heard him say, \"Thank you for being so open with me. I realize you're right. Now I feel it too. Actually, my first novel had a lot of flaws. Maybe I need to reflect. Maybe I don't have a talent for writing, or maybe I just need time.\"\n[1973-09-22 16:05:00] Vomero | I saw my mother-in-law immediately start saying a lot of nice things to me. She praised my ability to criticize myself, and she reminded me that I have my own audience, readers who are still waiting for me.\n[1973-09-22 16:05:10] Vomero | I saw myself muttering to myself. I heard, \"Yes, of course.\"\n[1973-09-22 16:10:00] Vomero | After seeing it, I immediately put the remaining manuscript into the drawer and also stored away the notebooks filled with notes. Then I threw myself into daily chores.\n[1973-09-22 16:15:00] Vomero | I thought about how the second book had made me waste so much energy, which caused me a great deal of frustration, and in the end, this irritation spread even to my first book, perhaps even to literary creation itself.\n[1973-09-22 16:15:10] Vomero | Sometimes, when an image or a fascinating sentence flashes through my mind, I feel a surge of pain, and I try to distract myself by thinking about something else.\n[1973-10-01 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw that all my energy was directed toward my family, my two daughters, and Pietro. I realized I had never once considered bringing Clelia back, not even once, and I had never thought of finding someone else to help me.\n[1973-10-01 09:05:00] Vomero | I found myself doing any kind of work I could. I thought about what I was doing, and realized it was just to make myself feel numb. It wasn't very hard for me, nor did I feel regret—like I had suddenly discovered the right way to use my life.\n[1973-10-01 09:05:10] Vomero | I thought there was another me, whispering in my ear: Don't let your mind wander.\n[1973-10-05 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself fully immersed in housework, taking care of Elsa and Dede. I thought about it and it brought me an unexpected surprise, as if, in addition to the child in my belly and the pressure of the manuscript, I had also freed myself from a more hidden burden, something I couldn't even explain clearly myself.\n[1973-10-05 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw Elsa showing that she was a very quiet little baby: she took long and pleasant baths, ate and slept well, and even smiled while sleeping.\n[1973-10-06 08:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but I had to be very careful with Dede. She hated this little sister very much. Every morning when she woke up, she always looked terrified and said. I heard, \"I dreamed that I saved my younger sister from fire, from water, or from the jaws of a hungry wolf.\"\n[1973-10-06 08:30:00] Vomero | Sometimes, she would pretend to be a baby and want to nurse, imitating a baby's cry. I know that in reality she wasn't satisfied with her situation. She was almost four years old, had a well-developed language ability, and could already take care of herself.\n[1973-10-06 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had always been full of feelings for her, praising her intelligence and her quickness. I made her believe that I needed her help with everything: shopping, cooking, and keeping an eye on the younger sister so she wouldn't fall.\n[1973-10-10 08:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, and at the same time I started taking birth control pills. I gained weight and felt swollen all over, but I still didn't dare to stop the medication. I thought about how worried I was that I had once again entered a state of pregnancy.\n[1973-10-10 08:05:00] Vomero | I thought back to that time, and the thing I feared most was once again being in a [childbearing state]. Also, I wasn't as concerned about my body anymore as I had been before.\n[1973-10-10 08:10:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that after having two children, I was no longer young, and I had to take on all kinds of hard work: giving them baths, dressing them, undressing them, pushing the stroller out, doing the shopping, cooking, holding one, pulling another, or holding both at the same time, wiping one's nose, wiping another's mouth, and taking on the daily chores.\n[1973-10-10 08:10:10] Vomero | I thought that as a woman I had matured, and I would be like the mothers in Mergellina—there was nothing to regret, nothing bad about it, I told myself.\n[1973-10-15 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw that after resisting for a long time, Pietro finally accepted the pill. He looked at me worriedly and said. I heard, \"You're getting rounder and rounder, what's with all these spots on your body?\"\n[1973-10-15 20:05:00] Vomero | I could see he was worried about me and the two children, or perhaps about himself getting sick, but he hated doctors, so I tried to reassure him. I saw that during that time he had lost a lot of weight: his dark circles became deeper, and strands of white hair had started to appear on his head.\n[1973-10-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I kept hearing him complain about knee pain, then pain in his right side or shoulder, but he refused to see a doctor. I forced him to go, and I took the child along to accompany him. The end result was that, apart from needing some sedatives, his body was perfectly healthy.\n[1973-10-20 10:30:00] Vomero | I saw that it made him overjoyed for a while, all his symptoms disappeared, but not long after, despite taking sedatives, he started having problems again.\n[1973-10-25 20:00:00] Vomero | I remember once when Dede wouldn't let him watch the news on TV, he brutally hit the child's bottom. I knew it was right after the military government came to power in Chile.\n[1973-11-01 14:00:00] Vomero | When I first started taking the pill, he wanted to have sex more often, but only in the mornings or afternoons, he said. \"I heard, 'If we have sex at night, it won't make me sleepy at all, and I'll have to study for half the night, which will make me overwork myself.'\"\n[1973-11-01 14:00:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Then let's not do it at night, whatever works.\" I knew all of that was nonsense, because for him, studying at night had always been a habit, not a necessity, but I still said it.\n[1973-11-05 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, of course. Sometimes he really gets on my nerves. It's hard to get him to do anything useful for the house, like going out to buy something when he's free, or washing the dishes after dinner.\n[1973-11-05 20:30:00] Vomero | One night, I lost my patience and didn't say anything harsh to him—I just raised my voice. I thought of something very important: all I had to do was shout, and his stubbornness would immediately disappear, and he would listen to me.\n[1973-11-10 18:00:00] Vomero | Sometimes I was strong with him, and that would make his imagined pains disappear, even the constant, excessive desire to have me. I thought about it, but I didn't like doing it. Once I did, I suffered myself, and I felt that it would trigger a wave of painful convulsions in him.\n[1973-11-10 18:00:10] Vomero | I saw that he would back down, adjust himself, and seriously do what he was supposed to do, but when he was truly exhausted, he would forget the things we'd agreed on, think only of himself, and slip back into his old ways. I thought that, regardless, the effect wouldn't last long.",

I thought, and he didn't wash it clean either—what good would that do me?\n[1973-11-15 21:00:10] Vomero | I saw only his stretched face, heard him mutter. His meaning was: I have work to do, but I'm wasting time here.\n[1973-11-15 21:00:20] Vomero | I thought it was best to make things easier for him; I was glad I could avoid a tense relationship.\n[1973-11-20 19:00:00] Vomero | I learned not to tell him about my own matters, in order not to make him anxious. I thought he didn't seem to care much about my opinion.\n[1973-11-20 19:10:00] Vomero | I thought that if we were to talk, say, about the government's measures in response to the oil crisis, and if he praised the Italian Communist Party's move toward the Christian Democrats, he would only want me to listen silently and agree with him.\n[1973-11-20 19:15:00] Vomero | I saw that on several occasions, I disagreed with his views, and he would act as if he didn't care, or else speak to me in the tone of a teacher addressing a student. I heard, \"You didn't receive a good education. You don't know about democracy, the state, the law, or the value of coordinating different countries and interests to achieve balance.\"\n[1973-11-20 19:15:10] Vomero | I saw that he would say it. I heard, \"You like the end of the world.\"\n[1973-11-20 19:20:00] Vomero | I thought about how I was his wife, an educated wife, someone he expected to listen carefully when he talked about politics, his research, and the new book he was working on with great dedication and deep emotion. But this attention was only emotional; he didn't want to hear my opinions, especially not when I expressed doubt about him.\n[1973-11-20 19:20:10] Vomero | I thought about how he spoke to me, as if he were thinking out loud, just trying to make his thoughts clear.\n[1973-11-20 19:20:20] Vomero | I thought of his mother and his sister, who were women of another type, and it was obvious that he didn't want me to become like them.\n[1973-11-25 20:00:00] Vomero | I never asked him where my manuscript for the second book I wrote went, nor did he ever inquire about my future plans. I realized that during his more vulnerable periods, I could tell from some of his words that he not only disapproved of my publishing my first book, but its success also made him deeply unhappy.\n[1973-11-25 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw that I had never mentioned writing again. I thought it seemed to relieve him.\n[1973-12-01 15:00:00] Vomero | I thought about Pietro's increasingly bad and unexpected behavior, but this didn't make me look for someone else.\n[1973-12-01 15:10:00] Mergellina | Sometimes I would meet Mario, the engineer, but I quickly realized that the desire to seduce others and to be seduced had disappeared. I thought about it and felt that the restless phase of the past made me feel ridiculous, but I'm glad that period has passed.\n[1973-12-01 15:15:00] Vomero | I no longer felt that longing to leave home and take part in the city's public life.\n[1973-12-05 10:00:00] Mercato | I saw that if I decided to join a debate or a demonstration, I would always take the two children with me, and my bag would be bulging with everything they needed. I thought to myself that I felt proud.\n[1973-12-05 10:05:00] Mercato | I heard, \"They're so young, they might be dangerous.\" I thought about what those who disapproved of what I was doing would say.\n[1973-12-10 10:00:00] Mercato | I went out every day, no matter what the weather was like, just to let my two daughters get some sun and breathe in fresh air.\n[1973-12-10 10:05:00] Mercato | When I go out, I always take a book with me; it's a habit I've had all my life, and in any case, I read. I thought that the ambition to create my own literary world had already disappeared.\n[1973-12-10 10:10:00] Mercato | I usually start by walking around, then sit on a bench not far from home, reading some complicated critiques, the newspaper, and sometimes I shout to myself. I heard, \"Dede, don't run too far, come to Mama.\"\n[1973-12-10 10:15:00] Mercato | I thought to myself that this is just how I am, I have to accept reality. Whatever happened in Lina's life is her own business.\n[1974-01-15 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw that during that time, Mariarosa came with Mergellina. I knew it was to promote a book about the Virgin Birth written by one of her university colleagues.\n[1974-01-15 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro swear that he would definitely come, but at the crucial moment, he made an excuse and disappeared somewhere.\n[1974-01-15 17:05:00] Vomero | I saw my sister-in-law arriving by car, this time she came alone, and she brought a lot of gifts for Dede and Elsa. I saw that she looked a bit tired, but she was still as warm and friendly as usual.\n[1974-01-15 17:30:00] Vomero | I saw that she had never mentioned my aborted novel. I thought that, although I was certain, Adele Airota had already told her.\n[1974-01-15 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw her speaking easily about her travels and the books she had read. I saw her, and she was still as full of passion as usual.\n[1974-01-15 18:05:00] Vomero | I thought of her, eager and enthusiastic, chasing after new things in the world, firmly believing in something, studying it for a while, then growing bored and moving on to something else—things she had previously denied, either through carelessness or blind faith.\n[1974-01-15 20:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that at the party, she spoke about her colleague's book and quickly gained the audience's approval. I knew everyone present were art historians.\n[1974-01-15 20:30:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that, by all accounts, she would have spoken about some academic matters and the evening would have passed smoothly, but suddenly she changed direction and, without thinking, said something indiscreet.\n[1974-01-15 20:30:10] San Gregorio Armeno | \"I heard that 'women should not bear children for any man, not even for the Father of Heaven; the children belong to the women themselves. Now, we need to do research from a female perspective, not a male one. Behind every discipline is the 'penis'; when this 'penis' becomes weak, it turns to iron rods, police, prisons, armies, and concentration camps. If you don't submit, if you keep causing trouble, then the massacre begins.'\"\n[1974-01-15 20:35:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her finally surrounded by a group of women. I saw Mariarosa finish speaking, and a wave of murmurs spread through the audience, with some agreeing and others disagreeing.\n[1974-01-15 21:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw her speaking to me in a very cheerful tone, asking me to come to her side. She proudly introduced Dede and Elsa to her friends at Mergellina, and spoke highly of me as well.\n[1974-01-15 21:05:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw someone mentioned my book, but I changed the subject. I thought it was as if the book wasn't written by me.\n[1974-01-15 22:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw one of them invite everyone to her house, once a week, to talk about women's issues. I saw that it was a very pleasant evening, and we formed a small group made up of various girls and mature women.\n[1974-01-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I found the little booklet that Adele Airota had given me earlier, and I pulled it out from under a pile of books. I would put it in my bag when I went out, and read it outside. I knew it was because of Mariarosa's very provocative remarks and the invitations from her friends.\n[1974-01-21 15:00:00] Mercato | I saw a title that really caught my attention — \"Ah, Hegel!\" — and I read that article first. I saw the gray winter sky.\n[1974-01-21 15:10:00] Mercato | I saw, as I was reading this article. I saw Elsa sleeping in her little cart, Dede wrapped in a thick coat, wearing a wool scarf and a wool cap, speaking softly to her doll.\n[1974-01-21 15:15:00] Mercato | I thought about every sentence, every word in this article, and they all shocked me, especially that reckless and unbridled free thinking.\n[1974-01-21 15:20:00] Mercato | I saw that I had underlined many powerful sentences, marking the parts that moved me with exclamation points and diagonal lines.\n[1974-01-21 15:25:00] Mercato | I know the book says: Ah, pfft! Hegel. Ah, pfft! The culture of men. Ah, pfft! Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Ah, pfft! Historical materialism, Freud. Ah, pfft! Psychoanalysis and penis envy. Ah, pfft! Marriage, family. Ah, pfft! Nazism, Stalinism, and terrorism.\n[1974-01-21 15:25:10] Mercato | I know, damn it! War, class struggle, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Damn it! Socialism, communism, and the trap of equality for all. Damn it! All manifestations of patriarchal culture, all forms of organization.\n[1974-01-21 15:25:20] Mercato | I know the fight against the defamation of women's intelligence, against the brainwashing of women. We must start with reproduction, and deny anyone [reproductive status]. We must overthrow the binary structure of servants and masters, and erase our sense of inferiority from our minds. We must be ourselves. Don't hesitate. Stick to your differences and take action.\n[1974-01-21 15:25:30] Mercato | I know that the university will not liberate women; it will only make the oppression of women more refined, and it will require us to oppose intelligence. Men have already entered space, but women's lives on this planet have not truly begun yet. Women are another face of this planet. Women are the subject, and they can be surprisingly unpredictable. We need to free women from their oppressive situation, and now, right now, is the time.\n[1974-01-21 15:26:00] Mercato | I know the person who wrote this article is Carla Lonci. I thought, how could a woman possibly think that way?\n[1974-01-21 15:27:00] Mercato | I thought about all the effort I had put into studying, but I had always been passive in receiving knowledge—I had never actually used those books, and I had never once doubted the books themselves.\n[1974-01-21 15:28:00] Mercato | I realized this was the way to think, and Carla Longhi had opposed it through thinking. After all that effort, I still couldn't learn how to think.\n[1974-01-21 15:29:00] Mercato | I didn't think Mariarosa would either: she read page after page of the book, then on a whim, expressed these ideas in her own words to impress people—this is the truth.\n[1974-01-21 15:30:00] Mercato | I thought that Lina used her mind, it was her instinct; if she had gone to school, she would have thought like this.",

I heard, \"When are we leaving?\"\n[1974-02-01 20:30:10] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw Elsa sometimes suddenly jump up and down with joy. I thought, but the problem wasn't just with my daughter. In fact, I would only meet women there who were similar to me, and they couldn't help me.\n[1974-02-01 21:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I found it boring because they were talking about things I already knew, and their way of expressing themselves was terrible.\n[1974-02-01 21:05:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought to myself, I have come to understand what it means to be a woman, and I am not at all interested in those difficult self-awarenesses.\n[1974-02-01 21:10:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how I didn't want to talk about my relationship with Pietro, or my relationships with men in general, in public, to testify on their behalf and show what men of every social class and every age were like.\n[1974-02-01 21:15:00] Capodimonte | I thought about making my mind masculine so I could fit into the male culture--what that meant, no one knew better than me, I had done it before and I still do it now.\n[1974-02-01 21:20:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that, in addition, I remained detached, not caught up in the tense atmosphere, the outbursts of jealousy, the authoritative tone, the weak voice, the hierarchy of intellectuals, and the struggle for leadership within this group. I thought that in the end, someone would cry uncontrollably.\n[1974-02-01 21:25:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I found myself facing a new situation, which naturally led me back to Lina. The way they spoke and discussed things fascinated me; they were very straightforward, even rude at times.\n[1974-02-01 21:30:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how I like to use long, wordy sentences to express myself, a habit I learned as a child. I felt an urgent need to express my true self, something I had never done before, and that might not even be my true nature.\n[1974-02-01 21:35:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that in such a situation, I suppressed my desire to speak, and I remained silent all along.\n[1974-02-05 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but I felt I should talk to Lina, talk about these things, in the same unflinching way, analyzing what had happened to us, talking deeply about the issues we'd never really discussed, like my terrible book I'd written, and her unusual crying.\n[1974-02-05 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought about this desire so strongly that I even wanted to take my two daughters to San Gregorio Armeno for a while, or have her bring Gennaro here, or we could just keep in touch by letter.\n[1974-02-05 10:10:00] Vomero | I told her once, over the phone, but I didn't get through to her. I told her about the feminist books I was reading and the group I was part of.\n[1974-02-05 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw her listen for a while, then start mocking the titles of the books, like \"Clitoral Woman,\" \"Uterine Woman\"—she spoke in a very vulgar way. I heard, \"What the hell are you saying? Elena, pleasure, sex, genitals—there are so many issues here? Are you crazy?\"\n[1974-02-05 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw that in the end, her tone became very contemptuous. I thought she wanted to show me something, but she couldn't talk about the things I was interested in.\n[1974-02-05 10:20:10] Vomero | I saw her getting angry, she said. I heard, \"Do something else, do what you're supposed to do, don't waste your time.\"\n[1974-02-05 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought it was obvious that this wasn't the right time. I thought I would try again later.\n[1974-02-06 14:00:00] Vomero | I thought about it until I finally reached a conclusion: I needed to get to know myself, to analyze my own feminine nature.\n[1974-02-06 14:05:00] Vomero | I thought about how hard I had worked to learn all those things men did. I felt I should understand everything, be able to do anything. I had overstepped, but what did political struggles have to do with me?\n[1974-02-06 14:10:00] Vomero | I thought about wanting to have face in front of men, wanting to stand at the same level as them. What level? The level of their reason, the most unreasonable level.\n[1974-02-06 14:15:00] Vomero | I thought about how seriously I had memorized those popular phrases, a complete waste of effort. I was confined by what I had learned, things that had shaped my mind and my voice.\n[1974-02-06 14:20:00] Vomero | I thought of the secret covenant I had made with myself in order to become outstanding.\n[1974-02-06 14:25:00] Vomero | I thought, now, after studying hard, I have to forget what I've learned, and, moreover, I have to think about what kind of person I am.\n[1974-02-06 14:30:00] Vomero | When I think of Lina in front of me, I am her subordinate. As soon as I step away from her, I change myself. Without Lina, I have no thoughts at all. Without her thoughts to support me, I cannot hold any idea.\n[1974-02-06 14:35:00] Vomero | I realized I should accept myself, the self that wasn't controlled by her, and the core of it all was that I had to accept that I was an ordinary person.\n[1974-02-06 14:40:00] Vomero | What should I do? Then try writing again? Maybe I'll lack passion, I'll just be going through the motions.\n[1974-02-06 14:45:00] Vomero | I thought I should stop writing, find some job, or, as my mother said, become a wealthy housewife, locking myself at home, or just give up everything—family, daughter, and husband.\n[1974-02-20 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw my relationship with Mariarosa become closer, and I often called her.\n[1974-02-20 18:10:00] Vomero | I saw that when Pietro discovered this, he began to talk about his sister in an increasingly contemptuous tone. I know she's frivolous and empty, dangerous to herself and others. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Mariarosa had always been the one who cruelly tormented him; she was the greatest worry of his parents.\n[1974-02-25 19:30:00] New Home | I remember one night when I was on the phone with my sister-in-law, Pietro came out of his room. I saw his hair was all messy, his face tired.\n[1974-02-25 19:32:00] Vomero | I saw him walk around the kitchen, stuffing some food into his mouth haphazardly, making jokes with Dede while listening in on our conversation.\n[1974-02-25 19:35:00] Vomero | I saw later, and suddenly he started shouting. I heard, \"That idiot doesn't know it's dinner time?\"\n[1974-02-25 19:36:00] New Home | After I apologized to Mariarosa, I hung up the phone immediately, I said. I heard, \"The food is ready, you can eat right away; you don't have to shout so loudly.\"\n[1974-02-25 19:37:00] New Home | I saw him mutter that it was foolish to pay for a long-distance call just to hear his sister's crazy talk.\n[1974-02-25 19:40:00] Vomero | I saw that I hadn't responded, so I set the table, and he noticed I was angry, so he said with some concern. I heard, \"I'm not angry at you, I'm angry at Mariarosa.\"\n[1974-02-26 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but ever since that night, he started reading the same books I had read, and whenever he came across the passages I had underlined, he would joke about it. I heard, \"All that's nonsense, don't be fooled.\"\n[1974-02-26 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw him pointing out the logical inconsistencies in the feminist magazines and manifestos.",

I heard, \"Do you think you're so special? But you're just like Mariarosa. Everything you have now is given to you by your parents.\"\n[1974-03-05 21:05:10] New Home | I saw him slap me, and it was right in front of Dede. I thought his reaction was unexpected.\n[1974-03-05 21:06:00] Vomero | I thought my ability to endure was stronger than his: I had suffered many slaps in my life, but Pietro had never slapped anyone, and of course had never been slapped himself.\n[1974-03-05 21:07:00] Vomero | I saw him stare at his daughter for a while, then he left. I saw on his face that he hated himself for his actions.\n[1974-03-06 01:00:00] Vomero | I saw my fire slowly fading, I didn't have sex with him and kept waiting for him, because he never came home. I thought about it and it worried me; I didn't know what to do.\n[1974-03-06 02:00:00] Vomero | I wondered if his nervous exhaustion was because he didn't rest enough, or if it was simply his nature—that nature hidden beneath thousands of books and good upbringing?\n[1974-03-06 02:10:00] New Home | I thought again, once more realizing how little I knew about him, how impossible it was for me to predict his actions: might he jump into the Arno River? Or was he already drunk somewhere? Perhaps he had even set off for Genoa, seeking comfort and confiding in his mother's arms?\n[1974-03-06 02:20:00] Vomero | I thought, I can't imagine what he might do. I was so scared. I realized, because of the books I'd read and the things I knew, I had ignored my own private life. I have two daughters, and I don't want a careless outcome.\n[1974-03-06 05:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro come back at five in the morning, I went to embrace him and kissed him intimately. I felt a deep sense of relief when I saw him return safely.\n[1974-03-06 05:05:00] Vomero | I saw him mutter something. I heard, \"You don't love me, you've never loved me.\"\n[1974-03-06 05:05:10] Vomero | I saw that in the end, he added. I heard, \"I am not worthy of your love.\"\n[1974-04-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I know that in reality, Pietro couldn't accept the problems that had appeared in all aspects of his life. He longed for a quiet, orderly existence, one governed by his unchanging routines: studying, teaching, playing with the children, making love, and getting some work done each day. I thought about how, in his little world, they dealt with Italy's extreme chaos in a democratic way.\n[1974-04-10 10:10:00] Vomero | I know, but in reality, he was exhausted by the various conflicts within the university. His influence abroad was growing, and his colleagues were constantly trying to undermine his work. He found himself increasingly marginalized and threatened. I thought about how he felt, because of my unease (what unease? I am a dull woman), our family was constantly under threat.\n[1974-04-15 15:00:00] Vomero | I saw one afternoon that I had Dede practice reading. I saw Elsa playing by herself, and Pietro was locked in his room; there was no sound in the house.\n[1974-04-15 15:05:00] Vomero | I felt some anxiety. I thought, Pietro would like to have a fortress where he could finish his book, while I would take care of the household and see the children grow up healthy.\n[1974-04-15 15:10:00] Vomero | I was reading until the end, and then I heard a doorbell. I ran to open the door. I thought it was surprising that it was Pasquale and Nadia who entered.\n[1974-04-15 15:12:00] Vomero | I saw the two of them carrying military backpacks. Pasquale had a thick, curly black head of hair and was wearing a worn-out hat, his beard was thick and curly as well.\n[1974-04-15 15:13:00] Vomero | I saw Nadia, who looked thin and exhausted. Her eyes were large, like those of a frightened little girl, but she was pretending not to be afraid.\n[1974-04-15 15:15:00] Vomero | I saw them get my address from Pinocchia. I knew the address that Pinocchio had was given to me by my mother.\n[1974-04-15 15:20:00] Vomero | I saw both of them being very enthusiastic, and I also acted very enthusiastic. I thought that it was as if there had never been any conflict or disagreement between us.\n[1974-04-15 15:30:00] Vomero | I saw them take over my house, throwing things all over the place, and Pasquale kept talking nonstop. I saw her speaking in the dialect, and she was talking very loudly.\n[1974-04-15 15:35:00] Vomero | I thought at first that they had shattered my mundane daily life, but I soon realized that Pietro didn't like them. What especially annoyed him was that they had come without calling ahead, and both of them were too casual.\n[1974-04-15 15:40:00] Vomero | I saw Nadia take off her shoes and lie down on the sofa. Pasquale didn't remove his hat; he kept fidgeting with things in my house, rummaging through books without asking, and grabbing a beer for himself and Nadia from the fridge. He drank it greedily, burping all the while. I thought it was funny enough to make Dede laugh.\n[1974-04-15 15:50:00] Vomero | I heard them say they decided to go out for a walk, just wandering around, that's what they said, without any specific purpose. \"I heard 'work?' \" I thought of asking Pasquale.\n[1974-04-15 15:50:10] Vomero | I saw him smiling. I heard, \"Enough, I've worked too much already, now I'm going to take a break.\"\n[1974-04-15 15:55:00] Vomero | I saw him show his own hand to Pietro, then he asked Pietro to take his hand out too. He ran his hand over Pietro's hand. I heard, \"Can you feel the difference?\"\n[1974-04-15 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, then he picked up the book \"The Struggle Continues.\" He ran his right hand over the first page. The crackling sound of rough skin moving across the paper made him proud.\n[1974-04-15 16:00:10] Vomero | I was happy to see him, as if I had invented a new game, and later he said it in a threatening tone. I heard, \"Without these rough hands, Professor, there would be no chair, no building, no car—nothing at all, not even you.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:00:20] Vomero | I heard, \"If the workers decided to stop working, everything would come to a halt, the sky would collapse, the heavens and earth would meet, cities would turn into forests, the Arno River would flood your beautiful houses, only those who keep working know how to survive, and you two, your books, would be torn apart by wild dogs.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:05:00] Vomero | I saw Pasquale's typical dialogue, which was very passionate and sincere. Pietro listened quietly, never once interrupting.\n[1974-04-15 16:10:00] Vomero | I saw Nadia was also silent at that moment. When her companion spoke, she lay on the sofa with a serious expression, staring at the ceiling.\n[1974-04-15 16:15:00] Vomero | I noticed that when the men were talking, she rarely spoke, and I didn't say much either. But when I went to the kitchen to make coffee, she followed me.\n[1974-04-15 16:16:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I said seriously when I saw her notice Elsa clinging to me. I heard, \"She loves you very much.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:05] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"She's still young.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:10] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"You mean, when she grows up, she won't love you anymore?\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:15] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"No, I hope when she grows up, she'll love me too.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:20] Mercato | I heard her say, \"My mother often spoke of you. You were just her student, but I think you're more like her daughter than I am.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:25] Piazza del Plebiscito | \"I heard 'Is that true?'\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:30] New Home Kitchen | \"I heard, 'Therefore, I hate you very much, and because you took Nino away from me.'\"",

I can't even remember what he looked like now.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:45] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"When I was a child, I really wanted to be like you.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:16:50] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"What do you mean, doing the same as me?

I never thought she would act like this.\n[1974-04-15 16:17:25] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"Between the two of you, I like her more. You're both piles of shit, completely unchangeable. You're the typical examples of lowlife scum, but you know how to flatter, and she doesn't.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:20:00] Vomero | I was dialogueless for a moment, and she left me alone in the kitchen. I heard her call out to Pasquale: \"I'm going to take a shower, you'd better wash up too.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:30:00] Vomero | I saw the two of them locked in the bathroom. I saw and heard them laughing inside, she let out a scream, I saw it, which worried Dede a lot.\n[1974-04-15 16:40:00] Vomero | I saw them half-naked, coming out of the bathroom. I saw their hair was damp, and both of them were very happy, still teasing each other as if we didn't exist.\n[1974-04-15 16:45:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro ask them a question similar to that. I heard, \"How long have you two been together?\"\n[1974-04-15 16:45:10] Vomero | I saw Nadia say coldly. I heard, \"We weren't together, that's why the two of you are together.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:45:20] Vomero | I saw that, at this moment, Pietro asked in the stubborn tone he only used when dealing with very superficial people. I heard, \"What do you mean?\"\n[1974-04-15 16:45:30] Vomero | I saw Nadia answer. I heard, \"You can't possibly understand.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:45:40] Vomero | I saw my husband still insisting. I heard, \"When a person doesn't understand, he needs an explanation.\"\n[1974-04-15 16:46:00] Vomero | I saw that, and Pasquale was smiling. \"I heard, 'There's nothing to explain, Professor! You should think, you're already dead, but you don't know it. Your life, your words are all dead. Everything is dead. You think you're very smart, democratic, and leftist, but these beliefs are dead too. How can you explain something to a dead person, just like explaining something to a dead man?\"\n[1974-04-15 16:50:00] Vomero | I know the atmosphere is extremely tense. I thought about how I hadn't said anything, how I kept thinking about the harsh words Nadia had said. She had said them and then continued to act as if nothing had happened, staying in my house as usual.\n[1974-04-15 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw it all end, and they finally left, just as suddenly as they had come. They packed up their things and disappeared. Pasquale, at the door, suddenly said in a melancholy tone. \"I heard 'Goodbye, Elena.'\"\n[1974-04-15 17:05:00] Vomero | I thought of Elena? Is my Mergellina friend also looking down on me like that? Is he trying to say that, for him, I am no longer Elena, nor Elena or Elena Greco? For him, yes, but for others as well? And for me too? I almost never use my husband's surname, and now, has my surname lost even the little bit of glory it had?\n[1974-04-15 17:30:00] Vomero | I cleaned the house, especially the bathroom, which they had messed up.\n[1974-04-15 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro say. \"I heard, 'I never want to see those two people in my home again. Although the guy himself doesn't realize it, someone who talks like that about intellectual work is purely a Fascist. As for the woman, she's the kind I know well—her mind is completely empty.\"\n[1974-05-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that everything confirmed what Pietro had said. I know that this confusion has now become very concrete, having swept through the people around me.\n[1974-05-01 10:05:00] Vomero | I learned from Mariarosa that Franco Mari had been attacked by members of Fascist in Porto, and he lost an eye; his condition was very bad now.\n[1974-05-01 11:00:00] On the Train | I saw myself, Dede, and little Elsa together, and we were about to leave right away to see him.\n[1974-05-01 12:00:00] On the Train | I saw myself getting on the train, playing with the two children, feeding them, but the other me was very sad. I thought of that poor, uneducated girl, who was the girlfriend of Franco Mari, very politically active and economically wealthy at the time. How much of that part of me remains now? — That part of me that once disappeared, but has now surfaced again.\n[1974-05-01 15:00:00] Porto | I saw my sister-in-law at the train station. I saw her face was pale and she looked terrified.\n[1974-05-01 15:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her take us to her house. I saw the house even more empty and disordered than when I stayed there after the last university gathering.\n[1974-05-01 16:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw my sister-in-law telling me many things she hadn't mentioned on the phone. I saw Dede playing and Elsa sleeping.\n[1974-05-01 16:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I know the incident happened five days ago, when Franco Mari gave a dialogue at a workers' vanguard meeting in a small theater packed with people. After the gathering, he and Silvia walked away together. Now Silvia is cohabiting with an editor from the Daily Paper, and they live in a nice house just a few steps from the theater.\n[1974-05-01 16:15:00] Spaccanapoli | I knew that that evening, Franco Mari was going to stay at Sylvia's house and leave for Piacenza the next day. They were almost at the gate, and Sylvia had already taken out the key from her bag, when a white van drove up and some members of Fascist jumped out. Franco Mari was beaten badly, Sylvia was beaten and then raped.\n[1974-05-01 20:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that we drank a lot of red wine. Mariarosa brought out the \"drugs\"—that's what she called them—and this time, I decided to try them. I thought, even though I had drunk, I felt empty inside and helpless.\n[1974-05-01 21:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw my sister-in-law speaking many angry words, and finally she stopped talking, crying instead. I couldn't find a single word to comfort her. I thought about how I could feel her tears, and I felt that when they slid down her cheeks, they made a sound.\n[1974-05-01 22:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her at the end, but suddenly I couldn't see her anymore, nor the room. Everything in front of me turned black, and I fainted.\n[1974-05-02 08:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I woke up and felt embarrassed, so I explained that it was because I was too tired. I thought about how little I had slept at night, how heavy my body felt. The words from the books and magazines seemed to fall down like drops of water. Suddenly, the letters and symbols could no longer be put together.\n[1974-05-02 08:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw myself pressed closely between the two children. I thought they would comfort me, protect me.",

    "text": "[1974-05-02 10:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw him the next day. I left Dede and Elsa at my sister-in-law's house and went to the hospital. In a pale green ward, I saw Franco Mari. I smelled the hospital room filled with various odors: bad breath, urine, and the smell of medicine.\n[1974-05-02 10:05:00] Hospital Mask Loc 005 | I saw him now swollen all over, his body seemingly shortened. To this day, my mind still clearly recalls the white bandages on his body, as well as the blue bruises on his face and neck.\n[1974-05-02 10:10:00] Hospital Mask Loc 005 | I saw myself speaking, telling him about my two daughters. I thought to myself, I felt that he wasn't very welcoming toward me, and he was ashamed of his own condition.\n[1974-05-02 10:15:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw it a few minutes later, and he said quietly. I heard, \"Go away, I don't want to see you here.\"\n[1974-05-02 10:20:00] HOSPITAL_LOC_005 | I saw that I still insisted on staying there, and he said impatiently. I heard, \"I'm not the same person anymore. You should go.\"\n[1974-05-02 11:00:00] Spaccanapoli | When I returned from the hospital, Mariarosa noticed that I was distraught. She took care of the children while Dede had just fallen asleep, and she told me to take a [intimate] nap too. I knew his condition was very poor. I found out from some of his companions that he would have to undergo surgery.\n[1974-05-03 09:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her the next day, and she wanted to go with me to see Sylvia. I tried to pull back, and I said, I'd rather remember the way I saw her at the student assembly.\n[1974-05-03 09:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw it, Mariarosa insisted, she wanted us to see her now, she cared a lot. I thought about going to see Franco Mari, and that was already unbearable, because you felt you couldn't help him at all, but only make him more vulnerable.\n[1974-05-03 10:00:00] Mergellina | I saw that we went together, and it was a very elegant lady who opened the door for us. I saw her golden curls hanging on her shoulders; her hair was very light in color.\n[1974-05-03 10:05:00] Mergellina | I saw her now with Mirko, who also has golden hair. I know she's Sylvia's mother, and Mirko is already five or six years old.\n[1974-05-03 10:10:00] Mergellina | I saw Dede immediately had Mirko, her, and Tess play a game. I knew Dede was still acting between annoyed and bossy, and Tess was her old doll, which she took with her wherever she went.\n[1974-05-03 10:15:00] Mergellina | I saw Sylvia sleeping, and she left a note saying that when we arrived, we should wake her up.\n[1974-05-03 11:00:00] Elena's House | I saw that we had waited for a long time before she finally appeared. I saw her with heavy makeup on, wearing a beautiful green evening dress.\n[1974-05-03 11:05:00] Mergellina | What shocked me wasn't the wounds on her body—the bruises and her somewhat unsteady gait—though her condition had been worse when Lina returned from her honeymoon and appeared before me. What truly shocked me was Sylvia's expressionless gaze.\n[1974-05-03 11:10:00] Mergellina | I saw her eyes were empty, and when she spoke, her words were incoherent, interrupted by nervous laughter.\n[1974-05-03 11:20:00] Mergellina | I saw her using this very method to tell me about what Fascist had done to her, because among the people present, only I didn't know the details of those events. I thought about how she spoke of this event, as if it were a very cruel and terrifying fairy tale.\n[1974-05-03 11:30:00] Mergellina | I saw her now constantly telling the story to visitors. I thought that this made the terrifying atmosphere seem frozen in place.\n[1974-05-03 11:40:00] Elena's House | I saw her mother try to interrupt her several times, but she always pushed her away with an annoyed gesture. She raised her voice and spoke slowly and clearly about the disgusting things those people had done to her.\n[1974-05-03 11:45:00] Elena's House | I saw her prediction clearly, that a very cruel revenge would soon take place in a very short time.\n[1974-05-03 11:50:00] Mergellina | I saw myself crying, and she suddenly stopped talking. At that moment, others arrived—family and friends, as well as her female acquaintances. Sylvia then resumed her story.\n[1974-05-03 11:55:00] Mergellina | I saw myself immediately hiding in a corner, hugging Elsa tightly and gently caressing her. As I thought about this, I remembered what Stefano had done to Lina, and many details—details that came to me when Sylvia was telling the story.\n[1974-05-03 11:56:00] Mergellina | I thought to myself, the words they spoke while telling their story all sounded like the cries of frightened animals.\n[1974-05-03 12:00:00] Mergellina | I later went to find Dede, and I saw her in the corridor, with Mirko and the doll. I saw the two of them pretending to be the father and mother of a child, but they were arguing, acting out a scene of parents fighting.\n[1974-05-03 12:05:00] Mergellina | I saw myself stop, and I heard Dede scolding Miklo. I heard, \"You should slap me, understand?\"\n[1974-05-03 12:06:00] Mergellina | I thought about the new flesh and blood bodies repeating the old story through the game. We were a series of shadows, always stepping onto the stage with the same love and hatred, desires, and violence.\n[1974-05-03 12:07:00] Mergellina | I looked at Dede carefully, she looked a lot like Pietro. I thought to myself, and I also felt that Milko looked exactly like Nino.\n[1974-06-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I didn't have to wait long before the underground struggles suddenly appeared in the newspapers and on television, and this also affected me. I knew about the coup plotters' plans, the police crackdowns, armed gangs, shootouts, injuries, massacres, bombings, and bloodshed, which all took place in both big cities and small towns.\n[1974-06-01 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pinocchio called me. I knew she was very worried because she hadn't heard from Pasquale in several weeks.\n[1974-06-01 14:05:00] Vomero | I saw her ask. I heard, \"Did he come to see you?\"\n[1974-06-01 14:05:10] Vomero | I heard, \"He came, but that was at least two months ago.\"\n[1974-06-01 14:05:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Ah! He asked for your phone number and address. He wants to ask you something and seek your advice. Did he ask?\"\n[1974-06-01 14:05:30] Vomero | I heard, \"What about what?\"\n[1974-06-01 14:05:40] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't know.\"\n[1974-06-01 14:05:50] Vomero | I heard, \"He didn't ask me anything.\"\n[1974-06-01 14:06:00] Vomero | I heard, \"What did he say?\"\n[1974-06-01 14:06:10] Vomero | I heard, \"He didn't say much, but he's fine, very happy.\"\n[1974-06-02 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pinocchia asking everywhere about her brother's whereabouts, also asking Lina and Enzo, and people who had been active with him on the way to the court.\n[1974-06-02 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw that in the end, she even called Nadezhda's family, but Nadezhda's mother was very rude. Later, Nadezhda just told her that she had moved out and left no contact information.\n[1974-06-02 11:10:00] Vomero | I heard, \"They might have lived together.\"\n[1974-06-02 11:10:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Pasquale and that woman? No contact address or phone number left?\"\n[1974-06-02 11:15:00] Vomero | I saw that we had talked for a long time, and I told her that perhaps because of Pasquale, Nadia had cut off all ties with her family, who knew, maybe they had already moved to Germany, England, or France.\n[1974-06-02 11:20:00] Vomero | I still didn't feel at ease even after seeing Pinocchio. I know Pasquale is a caring older brother, she said, and he won't just disappear like that.\n[1974-06-02 11:30:00] Vomero | I know she has a very bad feeling: there are daily conflicts in Mergellina, and every left-wing person has to be especially careful. The members of Fascist have already threatened her and her husband.\n[1974-06-02 11:35:00] Vomero | I know they said Pasquale set fire to the new Fascist party's branch, as well as the Solara family's supermarket.\n[1974-06-02 11:36:00] Vomero | I was amazed that I knew nothing about what had happened in Mergellina.\n[1974-06-02 11:37:00] Vomero | I asked, are those Fascist molecules saying it was Pasquale? I know that's true. He's at the top of the Fascist blacklist, the first to be eliminated. Pinocchia said, maybe Gino had her brother killed.\n[1974-06-02 11:40:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Have you gone to the police?\"\n[1974-06-02 11:40:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1974-06-02 11:40:20] Vomero | I heard, \"How did they treat you?\"\n[1974-06-02 11:40:30] Vomero | I heard, \"They're going to arrest me, they're even more dangerous than Fascist.\"\n[1974-06-03 10:00:00] Vomero | I called Professor Galiani, and she spoke to me in a sarcastic tone. I heard, \"What happened? I haven't seen your name in the bookstore or in the newspaper anymore. Are you retired?\"\n[1974-06-03 10:05:00] Vomero | I said that I had two daughters and that I was taking care of them, then I asked about Nadezhda, and she became very rude, saying. I heard, \"Nadia has grown up; she has left home and is living on her own now.\"\n[1974-06-03 10:06:00] Vomero | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"Where did she go?\"\n[1974-06-03 10:06:10] Vomero | I saw her answer. I heard, \"It's her business.\"\n[1974-06-03 10:07:00] Vomero | I saw her hang up without saying a word just as I was about to ask for her son's phone number.\n[1974-06-03 15:00:00] Vomero | I had spent a long time getting Nadia's phone number, and finding her at home also took a lot of effort.\n[1974-06-03 15:10:00] Vomero | I saw that when he finally answered the phone, he seemed happy to hear from me, even a bit eager to confide in me.\n[1974-06-03 15:15:00] Vomero | I know he's very busy at the hospital, his marriage has ended, his wife left and took the children with her, and now he's alone, his life a bit disorganized.\n[1974-06-03 15:20:00] Vomero | When he spoke of his sister, his tone became harsh, and he said softly. I heard, \"I've cut all ties with her. We have too many differences politically and otherwise. Since she started seeing Pasquale, she's completely lost her mind.\"\n[1974-06-03 15:21:00] Vomero | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"Did they move out together?\"\n[1974-06-03 15:21:10] Vomero | I saw that he didn't want to talk about this topic. I heard, \"You could say that.\"\n[1974-06-03 15:22:00] Vomero | I saw that, to him, this topic was trivial, so he moved past it. I know that the topic of the current terrible political situation was mentioned, as well as the massacre in Brescia, and we talked about the bosses who bought the parties. The situation worsened, and the Fascist extremists resurfaced.",

    "text": "[1974-06-04 10:00:00] Vomero | I called Pinochya again, just to reassure her.\n[1974-06-04 10:05:00] Vomero | I told her that Nadia had cut off all relations with her family in order to be with Pasquale, who followed her around like a puppy.\n[1974-06-04 10:06:00] Vomero | I saw Pinocchio ask. I heard, \"Do you really think so?\"\n[1974-06-04 10:06:10] Vomero | I heard, \"There's no doubt, that's what love is.\"\n[1974-06-04 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw her skepticism, but I still stuck to my opinion. I told her in great detail about that afternoon when Pasquale had come to see me, and I exaggerated a bit by saying that they were very much in love.\n[1974-06-04 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw that we hung up.\n[1974-06-15 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw her, but in mid-June, Pinocchia called me again in great despair. I know that during the day, Gino was killed in front of his own pharmacy, they shot him in the face.\n[1974-06-15 14:05:00] Vomero | I knew at that moment, she told me this news because the pharmacist's son was part of our teenage memories, whether he was Fascist or not. I was naturally shocked by this news, after all, we grew up together.\n[1974-06-15 14:10:00] Vomero | I knew, but she told me the real reason wasn't that. The police had gone to her house and searched it from top to bottom, including the gas station.\n[1974-06-15 14:15:00] Vomero | I know they're looking for evidence to prove it was Pasquale, and her situation is now worse than ever, worse even than when Don Achille was killed or when her father was arrested.\n[1974-06-15 14:20:00] Vomero | I saw Pinocchio in a panic, she cried. I heard, \"I think this is another persecution of my family.\"\n[1974-06-15 14:25:00] Vomero | I knew that the pharmacy in Gino's family was facing that bare little square. I think of it, but I can't erase that small square from my mind. I still clearly remember the arrangement inside the pharmacy, and I've always loved the taste of candies and syrups there.\n[1974-06-15 14:25:10] Vomero | I saw the dark wooden furniture from my memory emerge, as well as bottles of all colors lined up in rows. I thought about how I especially liked Gino's parents, they were always very warm.\n[1974-06-15 14:25:20] Vomero | I saw them bending over their work behind the counter, and when they leaned forward from the counter, it was like they were standing on a balcony.\n[1974-06-15 14:30:00] Vomero | I saw my mind conjure up the scene: when the gunshot reached their ears, they must have been in the shop, perhaps staring wide-eyed as their son lay on the threshold, blood spilling all over.\n[1974-06-16 10:00:00] Vomero | I wanted to talk to Lina about it, but she seemed completely indifferent. I thought it was just a common, everyday thing.\n[1974-06-16 10:05:00] Vomero | I just saw her and said. I heard \"It's strange that the police aren't looking for Pasquale.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought of her voice, which immediately seized me, convinced me, and made me understand that if Pasquale had really killed Gino—that was impossible—she would still have taken Pasquale's side.\n[1974-06-16 10:15:00] Vomero | I thought the police should realize that the dead man had done a lot of evil, and that he deserved his fate, instead of getting involved with our friend—a Italian construction worker.\n[1974-06-16 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw her say that, and then she spoke in a serious tone, asking if I could let Gennaro stay with me for a while, until school started.\n[1974-06-16 10:20:10] Vomero | I think of Gennaro? What should I do? I have Dede and Elsa to take care of, and that's already exhausted me.\n[1974-06-16 10:20:20] Vomero | I muttered something. I heard \"Why?\"\n[1974-06-16 10:20:30] Vomero | I heard, \"I have to work.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:20:40] Vomero | I heard, \"I'm going to the sea with my two daughters.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:20:50] Vomero | I heard, \"You should take him along too.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:21:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'I'm going to the sea at Posillipo, I'll stay there until the end of August. The child and I aren't close, you should come too. If you come, that's fine, I can't go alone.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:21:10] Vomero | I heard, \"But you have already sworn that you would take care of him.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:21:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes, but you were sick at the time.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:21:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Now I'm fine or not, you don't even know.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:21:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Are you sick?\"\n[1974-06-16 10:21:50] Vomero | I heard \"No.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:22:00] Vomero | I heard, \"You can't leave the child with your mother, or Stefano?\"\n[1974-06-16 10:22:10] Vomero | I saw her hesitate for a moment, then become quiet and withdrawn. I heard, \"Are you going to help me or not?\"\n[1974-06-16 10:22:20] Vomero | I saw that I was about to give in, and I said. I heard, \"Okay, bring him over.\"\n[1974-06-16 10:22:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Enzo will bring him over.\"\n[1974-06-22 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw Enzo arrive on a Saturday night. I saw him driving a spotless Fiat 500, the car he had just bought.\n[1974-06-22 19:05:00] Vomero | I saw him only through the window, heard him speaking in his dialect to the child in the car. I saw that I felt he brought thescent of San Gregorio Armeno and our Mergellina. I thought to myself that I had realized he hadn't changed at all, his movements still as steady, his body still as strong.\n[1974-06-22 19:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself opening the door, Dede tugging at my clothes, and I glanced only once at Gennaro. I thought to myself and realized that Melina hadn't been wrong five years ago: the child was now ten years old, and he no longer looked like Nino or Lina at all—he was a perfect copy of Stefano.\n[1974-06-22 19:15:00] Vomero | I thought about how complicated my heart was, mixed with disappointment and pleasure. Earlier, I had thought that this child would stay at home for a long time, giving my daughter some time to be together with Nino's son, and that was also good.\n[1974-06-22 19:16:00] Vomero | I thought, but I was also willing to accept it: between Nino and Lina, nothing remained.\n[1974-06-22 19:30:00] Vomero | I saw Enzo wanting to leave immediately, but Pietro warmly insisted that he stay, telling him to go the next day.\n[1974-06-22 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself trying to get Gennaro and Dede to play together, and Dede seemed to want to join in, but he shook his head firmly. I know that there is a six-year age gap between them.\n[1974-06-22 20:30:00] Vomero | What struck me was Enzo's attention to this child, who wasn't his son, yet he was very familiar with Gennaro's habits, tastes, and needs.\n[1974-06-22 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw Gennaro say he was tired, but Enzo still politely told him to go pee, wash his face, and brush his teeth before [intimate act].\n[1974-06-22 21:15:00] Vomero | I saw when the child fell asleep, Enzo gently took off his clothes and dressed him in pajamas.\n[1974-06-22 22:00:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw myself washing dishes and tidying the kitchen, while Pietro was chatting with the guests, who were sitting at the kitchen table.\n[1974-06-22 22:10:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw that they had nothing in common, and they started talking about politics.\n[1974-06-22 22:15:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw when my husband said that it was a good thing for the Communist Party to move closer to the Christian Democrats, but Enzo insisted. I heard, \"If this line of thinking wins out, then Berlinguer will have done the greatest favor to the working class's enemy.\"\n[1974-06-22 22:20:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw they were worried about an argument, so we stopped talking about politics. At that moment, Pietro cautiously asked about his job.\n[1974-06-22 22:25:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw that Enzo's curiosity was genuine, so I started talking, not as hollowly as usual. I spoke simply, but perhaps too professionally.\n[1974-06-22 22:30:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard that \"IBM System has now decided to send him and Lina to a bigger company, a factory near Nora, which has three hundred workers and more than forty staff members. The pay the company offered was simply impossible to refuse: thirty-five million lire a month for me, since I'm the head of the center, and ten million for Lina, who's my assistant. We accepted the job, of course. Now that we'll be making so much money, the task ahead is also going to be tough.\"\n[1974-06-22 22:35:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard them say, \"We are the supervisors; we are responsible for 'IBM System.' There are ten models, and we have two operators and five female punchers, who are also inspectors. We need to collect information and input a lot of data into the system, which allows the machine to do many things—calculating accounts, paying money, issuing invoices, warehousing, inventory management, supplier orders, production, and delivery. For this purpose, we need those cards, the punched cards. Those holes are everything; all the labor is reflected on them.\" I thought about how from that moment on, he had always used \"we.\"\n[1974-06-22 22:40:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | \"I'll give you an example. We need to perform a simple operation, starting with the invoice. For instance, the warehouse manager fills out a form with the product details and customer information. The customer has an ID number, his personal information also has a corresponding number, and the product has one too. The punch operator goes to the machine, presses the card issuance button, and then enters the invoice number, the customer's number, the personal information number, the product number, and the quantity, as well as other information on the card. You can imagine it: one thousand delivery slips, ten products, that's ten thousand punched cards, each with holes like needle holes. Do you understand? Are you clear?\"\n[1974-06-22 23:00:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw the whole evening pass like that. Pietro would occasionally nod to show he was listening, and sometimes he even asked questions. I heard, \"Those holes are the core, but isn't the part without holes just as important?\"\n[1974-06-22 23:10:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw myself cleaning something in the kitchen. I thought about explaining my job to a university professor. Enzo seemed happy about it, and Pietro listened like a well-behaved student. As an old friend of Enzo's, a university graduate who had even written a book once, I was now tidying the kitchen, completely unaware of all this.",

    "text": "[1974-06-22 23:20:00] New Home Kitchen | I thought that, in reality, I soon lost focus, getting lost in words I'd never heard before—\"file.\" When Enzo said the word, it sounded like the plural of \"fila,\" but he used the masculine form; it was a very mysterious thing.\n[1974-06-22 23:30:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought about how I had gotten lost behind Lina, who now knows all these words, is familiar with the machines and the job, and now works at a big company in Naples. Even though only her partner Enzo earns money, she is more prosperous than me.\n[1974-06-22 23:40:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought about how I had gotten lost behind Enzo, and he could proudly say, \"I definitely wouldn't have made it without her.\"\n[1974-06-22 23:45:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought about how he expressed his loyal love, clearly eager to remind himself and others that his woman was extraordinary, while my husband never praised me, instead constantly belittling me, making me nothing more than the mother of his children.\n[1974-06-22 23:50:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought that, even though I had gone to college, in the end I still didn't have the ability to think for myself. He had been humiliating me all along, belittling what I read and everything I was interested in, as if he would only love me if I acted useless.\n[1974-06-23 00:00:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw that I had finally also sat down at the table, like a shadow. I thought about how neither of them ever said to me, \"Let me help you set the table, let me help you clean up, wash the dishes, or sweep the floor.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:10:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw that, Enzo said. I heard him say, \"Issuing an invoice is a simple thing. I can just do it by hand; what's the big deal? But what if we have to issue a thousand of them? Those card readers can read two hundred cards a minute, so two thousand would take ten minutes, and ten thousand just fifty. The speed of the machine brings great convenience, especially since machines can now perform some complicated operations that used to take a long time.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:15:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Enzo continue speaking. I heard her say, \"Now, my job with Lina is this: get the system ready and perform some complicated operations. The development phase is really great, but the operational phase isn't as interesting. Often, the cards get stuck or torn in the sorter. Sometimes, a box full of cards accidentally spills all over the floor, which is also a hassle, but the job is great—it's troublesome, but great.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:20:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I wanted to show that I was also listening, so I interrupted him. I heard, \"Could he be wrong too?\"\n[1974-06-23 00:20:05] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Who is he?\"\n[1974-06-23 00:20:10] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard \"IBM System.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:20:20] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"There's no one else, Elena—only me. If something went wrong, if there was a mess, it was my fault, it was I who made the mess.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:20:30] New Home Kitchen | I said, then whispered. \"I heard, 'Ah, so that's how it is. I'm tired.'\"\n[1974-06-23 00:21:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Pietro nod, as if also intending to end the conversation that night, and he said to Enzo. I heard her say, \"It's really inspiring, but if, as you said, these machines can replace people, many jobs will disappear. In Fiat's factory, robots are already welding, and there will be a lot of people who lose their jobs.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:22:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Enzo nod first. He thought for a moment, and finally, he defended himself by quoting the one person he felt had the most authority. I heard \"Lina said, it's a good thing, those lowly, stupid jobs should disappear.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:23:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Lina, Lina, again Lina, I asked in a joking tone. I heard, \"If Lina is so capable, then why did they give you thirty-five million liras and only ten million to Lina? Because you're the boss and she's your assistant, right?\"\n[1974-06-23 00:24:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Enzo hesitate, as if he wanted to say something very urgent, but in the end, he decided not to, and he said nothing. I heard, \"What can I do? It's necessary to overthrow the private ownership of the means of production.\"\n[1974-06-23 00:25:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Pietro stand up and say, \"Let's go to sleep.\" I saw that at this moment, in the kitchen, for a few seconds, all that could be heard was the hum of the electric refrigerator.\n[1974-06-23 04:00:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw that Enzo wanted to leave at six in the morning, but at four in the morning, I heard him moving around in the house. I got up to make him coffee.\n[1974-06-23 04:10:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw us facing each other in the silent kitchen, and we began speaking in our dialect. I know that IBM System language disappeared, as well as the Italian we used when Pietro was around.\n[1974-06-23 04:15:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I asked him about his relationship with Lina, and he said they were fine, even though she never stopped moving.\n[1974-06-23 04:20:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw myself gathering the courage to say it. I heard, \"Maybe you should adjust your lives: Lina can't always work so hard.\" I thought to myself, I understand now—they are a pair of soulmates, working side by side. She earns so much now, and the tasks assigned to her are becoming increasingly complex.\n[1974-06-23 04:20:10] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"I've been talking to her all along.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:20:20] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Also, she still has to go through the divorce process. She and Stefano are still legally married, so that's pointless.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:20:30] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"She doesn't care at all about this.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:20:40] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"What's Stefano's attitude?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:20:50] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"They don't know that divorce is possible now.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:21:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Where's Pinocchio?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:21:10] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"Pinochia's life is now in trouble. The wheel of fortune has turned. Those who were once on top are now at the bottom. The Caracci family now has no money left and owes a lot to the Solara family. Pinochia wants to take advantage before it's too late.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:21:20] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"What about you? Don't you want to get married?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:22:00] New Home Kitchen | I thought to myself that I understood—he was very willing to marry, but Lina opposed it.\n[1974-06-23 04:23:00] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"Forget it, don't say anything.\" I thought Lina wasn't interested in a new marriage; she had other things on her mind.\n[1974-06-23 04:23:10] Piazza del Plebiscito | \"I heard 'Speak.'\"\n[1974-06-23 04:23:20] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"She never told you, did she?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:23:30] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard \"What's going on?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:23:40] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard \"about Michele.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:25:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw him speak in a concise manner, saying that for so many years, Michele had never stopped asking Lina to work for him. I knew he either wanted Lina to manage one of the Piazza del Plebiscito stores for him, or to be an accountant handling tax matters. In the end, he even offered her a monthly salary of thirty million lire, so she could invent whatever she wanted.\n[1974-06-23 04:30:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Enzo continue speaking, but later something worrying happened to Gennaro. I know that Lina's mother went to the school to pick up Gennaro but didn't find him. The teacher said he was there just a minute ago. Nino called Lina, and when she came back, she found him on a bench in the small garden. The child was quiet, then smiled, his eyes vacant.\n[1974-06-23 04:35:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Enzo go to talk to Michele, and Michele was very certain about it. I heard \"Enzo, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I really like Gennaro, whoever dares to touch him is dead. The only real thing in all this nonsense is that Lina is very smart, and she's wasting her intelligence, which is a real shame. For many years now, I've been asking her to work for me.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:40:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw Enzo say that later, Michele stopped Lina on the road and told him about an important proposal. I heard, \"He plans to rent a 'IBM System' for all his business activities. He wants Lina to be the head of the computer center and is offering her forty million lira a month.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:41:00] New Home Kitchen | I saw Enzo carefully ask me. I heard, \"You didn't tell her about this?\"",

But you should know, for her personally, it's a big leap forward, and for the two of us, it's a lot of money—when you add it up, we'll make seventy-five million lira. I don't know, did I make myself clear?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:41:30] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"What did Lina say?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:41:40] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"She will reply in September.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:41:50] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"What would she do?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:42:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"I don't know. Have you ever figured out what was going through her mind before she did anything?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:42:10] New Home Kitchen | I heard, \"No. But what do you think she'll do?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:42:20] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Whatever she does, I'll support her.\"\n[1974-06-23 04:42:30] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard, \"Support her even when you don't agree with her?\"\n[1974-06-23 04:42:40] Piazza del Plebiscito | I heard \"Yes.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:00:00] New House Stairs | I saw him as I walked with him to the car. I thought of telling him something he didn't know—that Michele had an intense, dangerous love for Lina, like a spider's web.\n[1974-06-23 06:05:00] Pigneto | I saw what I said. I heard, \"What if Michele wants to take her away from you?\"\n[1974-06-23 06:05:10] Pigneto | I saw him speak without the slightest expression. I heard, \"I'll kill him. But he doesn't want her, everyone knows he already has a mistress.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:05:20] New House Stairs | \"I heard 'Who is it?'\"\n[1974-06-23 06:05:30] Pigneto | I heard, \"Pinocchio, she's pregnant again with Michele's child.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:05:40] Pigneto | I heard, \"Pinocchio, Nino?\" I thought to myself that I had felt a bit confused at the time.\n[1974-06-23 06:05:50] Pigneto | I heard, \"This is Pinocchia, the wife of Alfonso Carracci.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:06:00] New House Stairs | I thought about the conversation I had with my classmate Alfonso Carracci, who tried to tell me that his life was very complicated, but I avoided the topic.\n[1974-06-23 06:06:10] New Home Stairs | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"Alfonso Carracci?\"\n[1974-06-23 06:06:20] Pigneto | I heard \"He doesn't care, everyone says he's a drifting man.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:06:30] Pigneto | I heard, \"Who said that?\"\n[1974-06-23 06:06:40] Pigneto | I heard \"Everyone.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:06:50] New House Stairs | I heard, \"Everyone was too vague, Enzo, what else did everyone say?\"\n[1974-06-23 06:07:00] New Home Stairs | I saw him say it with a hint of sarcasm in his voice. I heard, \"There's no end to the troubles in Mergellina.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:07:10] New House Stairs | \"I heard 'That means...?'\"\n[1974-06-23 06:07:20] New House Stairs | I heard them saying, \"Everyone is talking about the past, saying that the woman who killed Don Achille was the mother of the Solara brothers.\"\n[1974-06-23 06:10:00] Vomero | I saw him leave, and I hoped he would take the words he had said with him. I kept thinking about those words, which echoed in my ears, making me very worried and angry.\n[1974-06-23 10:00:00] Vomero | I called Lina, my voice laced with unease and irritation, I said. \"I heard that Michele asked you about his job thing, why didn't you tell me? Especially this last time he proposed. Why did you reveal Alfonso Carracci's secret? Why did you spread the story about the Solara woman? That was a joke between us.\"\n[1974-06-23 10:05:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Why did you send Gennaro to me? Are you worried about his safety? You can be clearer with me. I need to know the truth. Why aren't you telling me your real thoughts now?\"\n[1974-06-23 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought this was an outlet for me, but the words I spoke, the spaces between them, and my innermost thoughts all aimed to express one thing: I hope we don't stay stuck in the same place. I hope, even just through the phone, we can still fulfill that old wish—to maintain a complete relationship, examine it, clarify everything, and gain a full understanding of it.\n[1974-06-23 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw her, but Lina was annoyed. She was in a bad mood, and she was cold toward me. She spoke to me very briefly. I heard, \"You go on vacation, write things, be an intellectual—you find us too vulgar, too lowbrow, so you stay far away! Please, let Gennaro get some sun, or he'll end up hunchbacked like his father.\"\n[1974-06-23 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought of the mockery and contempt in her voice, almost rude. The things Enzo had told me became effortless in her mouth.\n[1974-06-23 10:25:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, yes, I'll live my own life, you live yours. Now you're almost thirty, if you don't want to grow up, then keep playing in the yard! That's enough, I'm going to the sea, I'm leaving right away.\n[1974-08-01 10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw Pietro driving, taking me and the three kids to Posillipo, where we rented a pretty bad apartment, and then he went back to Mergellina. I knew he wanted to finish the book he was working on.\n[1974-08-01 12:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw my sun umbrella in the first row on the beach, soft towels, lots of food, five different colored bikini suits, and mint cigarettes. I thought to myself, now I am a vacationer, a wealthy lady with three children and lots of toys.\n[1974-08-01 20:00:00] Rental House | I called Pietro and Lina every night.\n[1974-08-01 20:10:00] Rental House | When I called Lina, I would have Gennaro take the phone, and he would reluctantly tell her the main events of the day, then say goodnight to her.\n[1974-08-10 10:00:00] Posillipo | I sometimes heard his voice without meaning to, and it would deeply move me. I was mesmerized as he gestured while explaining to Dede how to play a game. I had thought for a while, but then I realized it wasn't like that—part of her flesh and blood lived on in Gennaro.\n[1974-08-10 10:10:00] Posillipo | I thought the child really did look like Stefano; he didn't resemble Lina at all, but his gestures, the way he spoke, some of his words and catchphrases, as well as his domineering personality, were very much like hers when she was a child.\n[1974-08-15 15:00:00] Posillipo | I saw Gennaro playing the part of a well-mannered little boy, even somewhat shy, but as soon as you turned your back, he would tease Dede, hide her doll, and hit her. I thought about Gennaro, who was different from his mother. He was treacherous, whereas Lina's evil and bad nature as a child was open and obvious; no punishment could make her hide it.\n[1974-08-15 16:00:00] Posillipo | I thought at the time that Dede was afraid of him, hated him, but the truth was different. As time passed, she became less and less able to resist Gennaro's oppression, and instead fell in love with it.\n[1974-08-15 16:30:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw that I spent my day screaming constantly. I heard, \"Dede, where are you going?\" \"Gennaro, come here!\" \"Elsa, what are you doing, don't put sand in your mouth!\" \"Gennaro, don't do that!\" \"Dede, if you don't stop, I'll show you some color.\"\n[1974-08-20 14:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw the place where they were hiding—a reedthicket near the beach. Once, I went with Elsa to see what they were doing. I saw what I had discovered: they had taken off their swimsuits, and Dede, out of curiosity, was touching Gennaro's little thing that he had revealed.\n[1974-08-20 14:05:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw myself a few meters away from them, not knowing what to do. I thought of Dede— I knew, I saw her— lying there masturbating often, but I had read a lot of books about childhood sexuality, and I even bought my daughter a little book.\n[1974-08-20 14:10:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw Elsa seeing her sister and she called out happily, \"Dede\"; at the same time, I heard Gennaro speaking crude words to Dede in dialect. I thought of all the words I had learned in the courtyard since childhood.\n[1974-08-20 14:15:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw that I couldn't control myself and I cursed them both, especially Gennaro. I grabbed his arm and pulled him away. I thought of all the knowledge I'd read about pleasure, the unconscious, neuroses, the various forms of sexual perversions in children and women, and it all immediately disappeared.\n[1974-08-20 14:20:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw him start to cry, and Dede said coldly and fearlessly. I heard, \"You're really mean!\"",

Did Lina have similar experiences? We had never talked about this.\n[1974-08-20 22:10:00] Rental House | I thought of something else. I tried hard to ask myself a question: Had there ever been a time when we had touched each other? During my childhood, my teenage years, my adolescence, and even after becoming an adult, had I never once longed to do that? What about her?\n[1974-08-20 22:15:00] Rental House | I thought to myself slowly: I don't know, I don't want to know.\n[1974-08-21 10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that, no matter what, during the days I was thinking about this, I avoided taking Gennaro to the public phone. I thought about how I was worried he might tell Lina that he wasn't doing well here, and even mention that thing to her, and this worry troubled me deeply.\n[1974-08-30 18:00:00] Posillipo | I watched August days pass like this: going home, doing errands, packing for the beach, going to the beach, coming back home, having dinner, eating ice cream, making calls.\n[1974-08-30 20:00:00] Posillipo | I watched as I chatted with the mothers of other children, all of whom were older than me. They praised my children and my patience, which made me very happy.\n[1974-08-31 10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that Pietro comes here on weekends. I knew that, just like many years ago in Ischia, Stefano and Rino would show up on weekends.\n[1974-08-31 14:00:00] Posillipo | I watched him swim with his two daughters and Gennaro, pretending to make them play very dangerous games, and all four of them were having a great time.\n[1974-08-31 23:00:00] Rental House | I saw him standing in the kitchen, wanting me to stay there when the children were asleep, so that the bed wouldn't creak. I thought to myself that marriage is not what people think it is; it's like an institution that strips all humanity from sex.\n[1974-09-07 09:00:00] Rental House | I saw Pietro discover the article among the various headlines on Corriere della Sera on a Saturday. I knew the article was about a small factory in the suburbs of San Gregorio Armeno, and those days, the newspaper had been reporting on the bomb that Fascist had thrown at Italicus.\n[1974-09-07 09:05:00] Rental House | I saw him asking me and handed me the newspaper. I heard, \"Your friend's old factory, wasn't it called Sokolov? What happened?\"\n[1974-09-07 09:10:00] Mergellina | I read that a team of three, two men and one woman, stormed a sausage factory outside San Gregorio Armeno. I know they first shot at the guard Filippo's legs, and now his injuries are very severe; then they went to the office of the factory owner Bruno Socavo—a young San Gregorio Armeno entrepreneur—and shot him four times, three in the chest and one in the head.\n[1974-09-07 09:15:00] Borgo | I thought of the moment I saw that report, and I seemed to see Bruno's ruined face, along with his teeth, which were dazzlingly white. Oh my God, I was absolutely stunned.\n[1974-09-07 09:20:00] Rental House | I saw Pietro watching the kids, then I ran to call Lina. The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.\n[1974-09-08 10:00:00] Borgo | I saw that at night I tried again, but no one answered. I didn't reach her until the next day, and she was very tense as she asked me. \"I heard, 'What's wrong? Has something happened to Gennaro?\"\n[1974-09-08 10:05:00] Rental House | I told her that Gennaro was fine, and I told her about Bruno. She didn't know anything about it. After I finished speaking, she muttered something very calmly at the end. I heard, \"You've really told me some bad news.\"\n[1974-09-08 10:10:00] Mergellina | I didn't say anything else, I just reminded her. I heard, \"You call someone you know and have them explain what's going on. Ask them, find out how to send a telegram of condolence.\"\n[1974-09-08 10:15:00] Rental House | I saw her mutter, \"Never mind,\" she said. I heard, \"I have no contact with anyone at the factory, and anyway, what telegram?\"\n[1974-09-09 09:00:00] Borgo | I saw that I had given up, but the next day, I saw an article written by Giovanni Nino, also known as Nino, on Il Manifesto. I knew he had given a detailed description of the small factory in the Campania region and provided a lot of information. He emphasized the political conflicts in this underdeveloped area, spoke with warmth about Bruno, and mentioned his tragic fate.\n[1974-09-10 10:00:00] Posillipo | Since that time, I've been keeping track of the developments, but it was all in vain. The incident soon disappeared from the newspapers. I thought that, besides this, Lina no longer wanted to discuss it with me.\n[1974-09-10 20:00:00] Mergellina | I saw her at night, and I called her with a few kids; she always spoke briefly, she would say. I heard, \"Let Gennaro answer the phone.\"\n[1974-09-10 20:10:00] Mergellina | I saw her become especially impatient when she heard me mention Nino, and she muttered something. I heard him say, \"He still has his old habit of always saying something. What does it have to do with politics? There must be some other reason. There are a thousand reasons why someone gets killed: being cheated on, economic conflicts, sometimes just because someone didn't like the way he looked.\"\n[1974-09-15 10:00:00] Posillipo | I thought like that, and days passed. Bruno was just a memory, which soon faded. Wasn't he the boss I had threatened by calling on Pietro's authority? wasn't he the boy who had tried to be intimate with me and had been forcefully pushed away?\n[1974-09-15 15:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought that ever since that time, I had been indulging in wild fantasies on the beach. I thought, Lila was very clever in hiding her feelings and emotions.\n[1974-09-15 15:05:00] Stazione Centrale | I wanted to uncover the truth, but she was just the opposite—she hid herself. The more I tried to pull her out and make her want to find out the truth, the more she retreated into the shadows.\n[1974-09-15 15:10:00] Stazione Centrale | I think of her as a full moon hidden behind a grove of trees, her face obscured by the branches.\n[1974-09-20 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw September, and I returned to Mergellina. I thought about it, but my thoughts hadn't faded—they had only grown stronger. It wouldn't have made any difference to say anything to Pietro.\n[1974-09-20 19:05:00] Vomero | I saw myself coming home with several children, which made him very unhappy. I realized too late about his book, and with the semester about to start, this made him even more anxious.\n[1974-09-22 20:00:00] Vomero | One night, at the dinner table, Dede and Gennaro started arguing for some reason. Suddenly, Gennaro stood up and left from the kitchen. I saw him slam the door hard, and I saw the frosted glass on the door shatter into pieces.\n[1974-09-22 20:30:00] Vomero | I called Lina and got straight to the point: she had to come immediately and take the child, who had been living with me for a month and a half already, but she asked. I heard, \"Can't you keep him until the end of the month?\"\n[1974-09-22 20:30:10] Vomero | I heard, \"No.\"\n[1974-09-22 20:30:20] Vomero | I heard, \"The situation here is very bad.\"\n[1974-09-22 20:30:30] Vomero | I heard, \"It's the same here.\"\n[1974-09-23 08:00:00] Vomero | I saw Enzo leave from San Gregorio Armeno late at night, and he arrived in the morning. Pietro was already at work, and I had already packed Gennaro's luggage.\n[1974-09-23 08:10:00] Vomero | I told Enzo that the relationships between the kids were terrible, unbearable. I thought I was sorry, but three children together were just too much, unbearable.\n[1974-09-23 08:15:00] Vomero | I saw him say he understood, that he thanked me for everything I'd done, but in the end he muttered something, as if to explain. I heard \"You know Lina.\"\n[1974-09-23 08:20:00] Vomero | I saw that I didn't respond. I thought about it partly because Dede was sobbing, overwhelmed by Gennaro's departure; the other reason was that if I had spoken up, I would have said that Lina's temper was really tough. I knew I would regret it.\n[1974-09-25 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought of some ideas that I myself didn't want to say out loud. I was afraid of the words I spoke, because they were actually the truth. I couldn't erase those words from my mind. I felt as if they were gradually taking shape in my brain, and I was mesmerized by them.\n[1974-09-25 10:05:00] Vomero | I think about it and I feel afraid, but I can't help thinking about those things. Among those seemingly unrelated events, I find connections and patterns, and this kind of thinking often takes over me without my realizing it.\n[1974-09-25 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought about how I had connected the sudden deaths of Gino and Bruno Socavo (the factory guard Philip barely escaped death), and in the end, I thought both events pointed to Pasquale, maybe even Nadezhda. These speculations left me in a state of excited agitation.\n[1974-09-25 10:15:00] Vomero | I wanted to call Pinochia and ask if she had any news about her brother, but then I changed my mind. I thought about how I was worried that her phone call was being monitored.\n[1974-09-25 10:20:00] Vomero | When I thought about Enzo coming to pick up Gennaro, I told myself: Now I'll talk to him, I'll see how he reacts. But when I faced him, I still remained silent, afraid that I'd say too much, afraid that I'd slip and mention Pasquale and Nadia's names.\n[1974-09-25 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought of Lina, and she was still the same: Lina only acted, never spoke; Lina had completely absorbed our Mergellina culture, never considering issues like the country, the police, or the law. She believed only a leather cutter could solve things.\n[1974-09-25 10:30:10] Vomero | I thought about how Lina understood the terror of inequality; during the gathering on her way to court, she had found in revolutionary theory and methods a way to use her overly active mind.\n[1974-09-25 10:30:20] Vomero | I thought about how Lina had turned all her old and new grudges into political goals; Lina pushed people to act as if they were characters in a novel; in both the past and the present, she had linked the poverty we'd experienced, the oppression we'd suffered, and the armed struggle against Fascist, the factory owners, and capital.\n[1974-09-25 10:35:00] Vomero | I think about it now, and this is the first time I've clearly explained it. I admit that during those days in September, I didn't just suspect Pasquale—who had always had a tendency to take up arms—but also Nadia. I suspected that Lina herself had orchestrated these bloody incidents.\n[1974-09-25 10:40:00] Vomero | I thought that for a long time, whenever I was cooking or taking care of my daughter, I seemed to see her with two other people, shooting at Gino, shooting at Philip, shooting at Bruno Socavo.\n[1974-09-25 10:45:00] Vomero | I thought about how I couldn't imagine the specific actions of Pasquale and Nadia—I felt Pasquale was a good kid, a bit boastful, tough in fights, but he wouldn't kill anyone; I also thought Nadia was a girl from a good family, she might curse someone once in a while—but I never doubted Lina.\n[1974-09-25 10:45:10] Vomero | I thought she would come up with some very effective plans, reducing the risk to a minimum, she would control her fear, and she would give murder a very abstract purity.\n[1974-09-25 10:45:20] Vomero | I thought about how she knew how to turn a person's body into a corpse and blood, and she would have no hesitation or regret. She would kill and feel that she was doing the right thing.\n[1974-09-25 11:00:00] Vomero | I thought of her as if she were right in front of me, very clear—her, and Pasquale, shadow-like, and Nadia, I don't know if there were others.\n[1974-09-25 11:05:00] Vomero | I thought of them driving the car, passing through the small square, slowing down in front of the pharmacy, and shooting at Gino, shooting at his white coat.\n[1974-09-25 11:05:10] Vomero | I thought about how they had taken that dusty road, lined with all sorts of trash, and arrived at the factory in Soccavo. Pasquale shot at the guard Philip's legs through the fence, and the guard, eyes wide with fear, was shouting loudly, blood spreading everywhere in the booth.\n[1974-09-25 11:05:20] Vomero | I thought of Lina, who was very familiar with that place. She walked through the courtyard, entered the factory, climbed the stairs, and burst into Bruno's office just as he was happily greeting her: \"Hey, what brought you here?\" She shot him three times in the chest and once in the face.\n[1974-09-25 11:10:00] Vomero | I thought, yes, this is the real thing—the anti-Fascist activists, the new resistance movement, proletarian justice, and other slogans. Facing these ideas, instinctively, she could rise above the ordinary people, and she could give those slogans real meaning.\n[1974-09-25 11:15:00] Vomero | I thought that these actions might be required to join organizations like \"Red Brigades\" or the \"First Line\"—Lina would soon disappear from Mergellina, just like Pasquale.\n[1974-09-25 11:20:00] Vomero | I thought maybe because of this, she decided to entrust Gennaro to me, ostensibly for a month, but in reality, she wanted to give her son to me to raise, and I would never see her again.\n[1974-09-25 11:25:00] Vomero | I thought either she would be arrested like the leaders of \"Red Brigades,\" Curzio and Franceschini, or she would escape the police and avoid prison, as she always had, with her endless imagination and recklessness.\n[1974-09-25 11:30:00] Vomero | I thought that when she finished those great deeds, she would return in triumph, revered for her extraordinary achievements, and as a revolutionary leader, she would say to me: \"You write novels, but my life is itself a novel, its characters real, the blood that flows is real.\"\n[1974-09-25 23:00:00] Vomero | I think that at night, I will feel that the things I imagine are really happening, or are happening right now. I feel afraid and worried for her. I see her injured, being chased, like all those people in the world who are caught in chaos and danger. This makes me feel heartbroken, but it also makes me jealous.\n[1974-09-25 23:05:00] Vomero | I thought of some of my childhood beliefs, which have become increasingly clear: she was destined to accomplish great and remarkable deeds.\n[1974-09-25 23:10:00] Vomero | I thought about how sorry I was for running away from San Gregorio Armeno and separating from her. In reality, I should have stayed by her side. What made me angry was that she chose that path without discussing it with me, as if she thought it wasn't worth my opinion.\n[1974-09-25 23:15:00] Vomero | I thought that although I was very familiar with capital, oppression, class struggle, and the inevitability of the proletarian revolution, I would be useful to her, and I would take part in her actions.\n[1974-09-25 23:20:00] Vomero | I felt very uneasy and lay listlessly in bed. I felt deeply dissatisfied with my identity as a housewife, as a married woman. My future was depressing, and I would have to repeat the same domestic rituals in the kitchen and the bedroom until I died.\n[1974-09-26 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought about the daytime, when my mind would be clearer, and fear would take over. I imagined a capricious Lina, very skilled at inciting trouble, who became more and more involved in those cruel actions.\n[1974-09-26 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought, of course, she had the courage to move forward, she would act with determination, ruthlessly, like those people who were absolutely certain of themselves, but what was her purpose?\n[1974-09-26 10:10:00] Vomero | Would I really start a civil war? Let Mergellina, San Gregorio Armeno, and the entire Italy become a battlefield, a Vietnam in the Mediterranean?",

    "text": "[1974-09-26 10:10:10] Vomero | Am I to have us all caught in an endless, merciless struggle, caught between the East and the West? Or is the flame of battle to burn across all of Europe, spreading to the entire world?\n[1974-09-26 10:10:20] Vomero | I thought about achieving eternal victory? What kind of victory? The city destroyed, streets filled with fire and corpses.\n[1974-09-26 10:10:30] Vomero | I thought that the attack wasn't just aimed at class enemies, but could also occur within the same trench, all in the name of class revolution and dictatorship. Conflicts could arise between revolutionary groups from different regions, even leading to nuclear war.\n[1974-09-26 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw and I was so afraid that I closed my eyes. I thought of the two children, of the future. I thought of some concepts that others had spoken of: unpredictable subjects, the destructive logic of patriarchy, the value of women, compassion.\n[1974-09-26 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, I should talk to Lina and have her tell me everything she's done, everything she plans to do, and then I'll decide whether to support her.\n[1974-10-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but I never called her, and she never called me either. I'm certain that, over so many years, our telephone conversations brought us no benefit at all.\n[1974-10-01 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought about connecting the past events, but only to get rid of them.\n[1974-10-01 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought that, for each other, we had become abstract entities. Now, I could imagine her as a computer expert, or as a city warrior, very resolute and expressionless.\n[1974-10-01 10:15:00] Vomero | I thought about her, and she might imagine me as a successful intellectual, or perhaps as a refined and wealthy lady whose daily life consisted of taking care of children, reading, and having profound conversations with her scholarly husband.\n[1974-10-01 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought we both needed to get to know each other anew, to have real face-to-face contact. But we had already drifted apart, and there would never be another chance for us to be close again.\n[1974-11-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw it like that, September passed, then October, and I didn't tell anyone about it. I know I didn't say anything to Adele Airota; she was very busy at that stage.\n[1974-11-01 10:05:00] Vomero | I didn't say anything to Mariarosa either. I knew she had brought Franco Mari into her home--a disabled, helpless Franco Mari, a Franco Mari who had changed because of his depression, like a completely different person.\n[1974-11-01 10:10:00] Vomero | I called Mariarosa, and she was very warm and promised to greet Franco Mari on my behalf, but she always hung up quickly, saying she had a lot to do.\n[1974-11-01 10:15:00] Vomero | I gave up on seeing Pietro, he was always silent. I thought that the world outside the books had become increasingly heavy for him.\n[1974-11-01 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw him going to the university unwillingly. I knew that because of the mess at school, he often took sick leave.\n[1974-11-01 10:25:00] Vomero | I saw him say he wanted to do research at home, but he never finished his book. He rarely locked himself in his room to study, as if to free himself and beg my forgiveness, he took care of Elsa, cooked, cleaned, did the laundry, and ironed the clothes.\n[1974-11-01 10:30:00] Vomero | I realized I had to be very harsh with him to get him to go to class, but I soon regretted it. I began to worry about him since those violent incidents had already involved people I knew.\n[1974-11-01 10:35:00] Vomero | I thought about his dangerous situation, but he had never given up his own views. He openly opposed his students and many colleagues, summing it up in one sentence: they were doing foolish things.\n[1974-11-01 10:40:00] Vomero | I thought that although I was worried about him, perhaps precisely because I was so worried, I had never supported his point of view.\n[1974-11-01 10:45:00] Vomero | I thought that, under my criticism, he would reconsider, would abandon his counter-revolutionary reformism (I used that exact word), and become more flexible.\n[1974-11-01 10:50:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but in his eyes, my actions made me the same as those students who attacked him and the teachers who opposed him.\n[1974-11-05 20:00:00] Vomero | I thought, but things weren't like that; the situation was far more complicated. On one hand, I really wanted to protect him; on the other hand, I felt I was standing with Lina, and I supported her actions—I secretly believed she was responsible for those terrible events.\n[1974-11-05 20:05:00] Vomero | I thought about this, which made me want to pick up the phone and call her sometimes, to talk about Pietro, to talk about our conflict, and then listen to her thoughts. As we talked, the conversation would naturally turn back to her.\n[1974-11-05 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw, of course, but I didn't do it. I thought about discussing these issues over the phone and expecting the other person to tell the truth—it was ridiculous.\n[1974-11-10 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw her one night, and it was her who called me; she was very happy. I heard, \"I have some good news to tell you.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:00:10] Vomero | I saw what I asked. \"I heard 'What happened?'\"\n[1974-11-10 20:00:20] Vomero | I saw her say it. \"I heard myself say, 'I've become the head of a computer center.'\"\n[1974-11-10 20:00:30] Vomero | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"What do you mean?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:00:40] Vomero | I saw her say. I heard, \"Michele rented an IBM IBM System, and I became the head of Capodimonte.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:01:00] Vomero | I thought I hadn't believed it, so I asked her to repeat it, to explain it more clearly. Had she accepted Solara's offer? After resisting for so long, had she gone back to work for him again, just like during that time in Piazza Martiri?\n[1974-11-10 20:02:00] Vomero | I saw her say, yes. She was full of passion, growing more and more happy, more and more direct. I know that Michele rented a IBM System, which was placed in a shoe warehouse in the Acherri district, and she was given charge of it. She would have her own operator and puncher, and her salary was forty-two million five hundred thousand lira per month.\n[1974-11-10 20:03:00] Vomero | I saw what I said. I thought back to that time, and the female warrior I had imagined immediately vanished. I felt very sad, and all my understanding of Lina seemed to crumble.\n[1974-11-10 20:03:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I never thought you'd do something like this.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:03:20] Vomero | I heard, \"What should I do then?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:03:30] Vomero | I heard \"No.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:03:40] Vomero | I heard \"Why?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:03:50] Vomero | I heard, \"We all know what the Solara brothers are like.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:04:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Because of that? I've already decided, working for Michele is much better than working for that bastard Soccavo.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:04:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Do whatever you want.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:04:20] Vomero | I saw and heard her breathing, she said. I heard, \"I don't like the way you're talking to me, Elena. I'm making more than Enzo now, and he's a man. What's the problem?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:04:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Nothing.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:04:40] Vomero | I heard, \"You're still thinking about the revolution, the working class, the new world, and all those other things?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:04:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Stop talking. If you suddenly want to have a real conversation with me, okay. But if you're just wasting my time with nonsense, forget it.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:05:00] Vomero | \"I wonder if I can remind you of something? Whether you're speaking or writing, you always use words like 'really' and 'really,' and you keep saying 'suddenly.' But when do people 'really' talk about an issue, and when does something 'suddenly' happen? You know better than me, all things have causes and effects, one thing leads to another. I don't 'really' do anything anymore, Elena. I've learned to pay attention to the causes and effects of things. Only a fool would think something just suddenly happens.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:05:30] Vomero | \"I heard, 'Fine. What do you want me to believe? Everything's under your control, you're using Michele, not the other way around? Forget it, goodbye.'\"\n[1974-11-10 20:05:40] Vomero | I heard, \"No, don't, just say what you want to say.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:05:50] Vomero | I heard, \"I have nothing to say.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:06:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Speak up, if you won't, I will.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:06:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Go ahead, let me hear.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:06:20] Vomero | I heard, \"You're criticizing me, but you say nothing about your sister?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:06:30] Vomero | I saw things as if in a fog, and I asked. I heard, \"What does this have to do with my sister?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:06:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Don't you know anything about Elena?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:06:50] Vomero | I heard, \"I should know what?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:07:00] Vomero | I saw her let out a nasty laugh. I heard, \"Ask your mother, your father, and your brothers.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:07:10] Vomero | I saw that she didn't want to talk to me anymore, and she hung up angrily.\n[1974-11-10 20:15:00] Vomero | I called my parents' house, very uneasy, and it was my mother who answered. She said. I heard, \"You still think about us from time to time.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:15:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Mom, what happened to Elena?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:15:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Something happened that happens to every woman.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:15:30] Vomero | I heard \"That is to say.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:15:40] Vomero | I heard, \"She's with a man.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:15:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Has she gotten engaged?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:16:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Even if that's the case.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:16:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Who is she with?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:16:20] Vomero | I heard \"and Marcello.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:17:00] Vomero | I thought of that answer, and it pierced my heart.\n[1974-11-10 20:18:00] Vomero | I realized this was the thing Lina didn't want to tell me. Marcello—the handsome Marcello from our youth, the one who had desperately and hopelessly pursued her, the young man she had humiliated by marrying Stefano Carraci—now he was with my sister Elisa, the youngest child in our family, my gentle little sister, the one I've always thought was a remarkable girl.\n[1974-11-10 20:19:00] Vomero | I thought of Elena obediently following him, how my parents and brothers had not even lifted a finger to stop it, and how my entire family, including myself, had become relatives of the Solara family.\n[1974-11-10 20:20:00] Vomero | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"How long has it been?\"\n[1974-11-10 20:20:10] Vomero | \"I don't know, maybe a year,\" I heard.\n[1974-11-10 20:20:20] Vomero | \"I heard, 'You've agreed?'\"\n[1974-11-10 20:20:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Did you get our permission? Do whatever you want, and she did the same thing too.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:20:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Pietro is not Marcello.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:20:50] Vomero | I heard, \"You're right: Marcello wouldn't treat Elisa that way, just like you treated Pietro.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:21:00] Vomero | I saw a silence, and I said. I heard, \"You can tell me, ask me.\"\n[1974-11-10 20:21:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Why? You've already left. You spoke nicely: don't worry, I'll take care of you. You're always thinking about your own things and don't care about our lives at all.\"\n[1974-11-11 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had to take the children back to San Gregorio Armeno immediately. I thought about taking the train, but Pietro volunteered to drive us, so he could conveniently avoid going to work.\n[1974-11-11 15:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw that San Gregorio Armeno was too crowded, and we hadn't even reached the Gonnella district when we got stuck in traffic. I felt once again captured by this city, sensing those unwritten laws.",

    "text": "[1974-11-11 15:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw drivers coming and going constantly honking their horns, cursing Pietro because he didn't know the way. Sometimes he hesitated, slowed down, which really annoyed me. I thought about how, since I got married, I had never set foot in this city again, its noise was unbearable for me.\n[1974-11-11 15:20:00] Spaccanapoli | I told him to pull over as we approached Piazza Carlo III, and I moved to the driver's seat, taking control of the wheel in a very assertive manner. I drove straight to Mercato, the hotel where he had stayed the last time.\n[1974-11-11 17:00:00] Porto | I saw us putting our luggage down, and I carefully dressed myself and my two daughters. Finally, we went to Mergellina, to my parents' house.\n[1974-11-11 18:00:00] Elena's Parents' House | What could I possibly do? Demand that Elena cancel her engagement to Marcello, using the authority I gained through my older sister's status, my university degree, and a good marriage? Tell her that once, Marcello had grabbed my arm and tried to drag me into his Fiat 1100, breaking the bracelet my mother had given me, and therefore you should believe me, he's a vulgar and violent man?\n[1974-11-11 18:05:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought so. I felt full of determination; my task was to pull Elena out of that trap.\n[1974-11-11 18:10:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my mother warmly welcoming Pietro, and she gave my two daughters one gift after another, which made them very happy. I heard, \"This is for Dede, this is for Elsa.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:15:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my father was very agitated. I waited for my two younger brothers to come, but I found they were not at home. I heard his voice was a bit hoarse and felt he had grown thinner, losing even more status at home.\n[1974-11-11 18:20:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my father say it in a very calm way. I heard, \"They've been working all along.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:20:10] Elena's Parents' House | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"What are they doing?\"\n[1974-11-11 18:20:20] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my mother insert a comment. I heard \"suffering.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:20:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"Where?\"\n[1974-11-11 18:20:40] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"Marcello arranged jobs for them.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:21:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how the Solara brothers had placed Antonio and what happened to him later.\n[1974-11-11 18:21:10] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw what I asked. I heard, \"What are they doing?\"\n[1974-11-11 18:21:20] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my mother angrily respond. I heard, \"It's fine as long as they bring money back home. Elena, Elisa isn't like you—Elisa thinks about all of us.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:21:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I pretended not to hear, I said. I heard, \"I'm back today, did you tell her? Where is she?\"\n[1974-11-11 18:21:40] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my father lower his head, and my mother said impatiently. I heard, \"She's in her own house.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:21:50] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself saying angrily. I heard, \"She doesn't live here anymore?\"\n[1974-11-11 18:22:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard \"It's not living.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:22:10] San Gregorio Armeno | I heard, \"Since when?\"\n[1974-11-11 18:22:20] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw my mother say coldly. I heard, \"It's been almost two months, and she has a nice house with Marcello in the new Mergellina.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:25:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that they weren't just engaged, they were living together. I wanted to go straight to Elena's house, but my mom kept on talking. I heard, \"What are you doing? Your sister is preparing a surprise for you, stay here and wait, we'll go together later.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:30:00] Elena's Parents' House | I saw it but didn't listen to her. I called Elena, and she was happy to hear from me, also a bit embarrassed. I said. I heard, \"Wait for me, I'll be right there.\"\n[1974-11-11 18:35:00] Capodimonte | I saw that I had left Pietro and the two daughters at my parents' house, and I was walking toward my sister's home.\n[1974-11-11 18:40:00] Capodimonte | I saw peeling walls, bumpy roads, and trash everywhere. The walls were covered with obituary notices. I had never seen so many obituaries before. I thought to myself that this Mergellina seemed even more dilapidated.\n[1974-11-11 18:42:00] Capodimonte | I saw old Ugo Solara, the grandfather of Marcello and Michele, was dead. I saw many exaggerated words on the obituary, and the sorrowful face of the Virgin Mary; the names of the deceased had already begun to fade and blur. I knew, according to the date on the obituary, it wasn't something recent, but rather about two months ago.\n[1974-11-11 18:45:00] Capodimonte | I saw that, even so, these obituaries still clung to the street, not falling off. I thought that, as if out of respect, the other dead had decided to disappear quietly from this world.\n[1974-11-11 18:50:00] Capodimonte | I saw many obituaries at the door of Stefano's Capodimonte, and the shop was open. I thought the shop was like a wound in the wall, empty and dark inside. Karachi was at the very back of the store, wearing a white coat, and then he vanished like a ghost.\n[1974-11-11 18:55:00] Capodimonte | I saw myself walking up towards the tracks, passing by the place we had previously called New Capodimonte. I saw that the roller door was down, and it was slightly misaligned on both sides. It didn't close properly, and it was also rusty. There were vulgarities and drawings all over it.\n[1974-11-11 19:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw that part of Mergellina seemed completely abandoned, the white houses from before had turned gray, and in some places, the plaster on the walls had peeled off, revealing the bricks underneath.\n[1974-11-11 19:05:00] Capodimonte | I saw that I had passed the house where Lina used to live. I saw those half-dead saplings along the road, only a few still remained. The gate's glass had a broken piece, taped up with adhesive tape.\n[1974-11-11 19:15:00] Castel dell'Ovo | I saw that Elena's place was much higher up, in a neater and more elegant neighborhood.\n[1974-11-11 19:20:00] Elisha Apartment Building | I saw the gatekeeper stick his head out. He was a thin-haired, balding man who stopped me and rudely asked who I was looking for.\n[1974-11-11 19:20:10] Elisha Apartment Building | I didn't know how to say it, so I mumbled something. I heard the word \"Soraya.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:20:20] Elisha Apartment Building | I saw him and he immediately showed me respect, letting me pass.\n[1974-11-11 19:22:00] Elisha Apartment Elevator | I didn't realize how out of touch I was until I saw someone get into the elevator. I thought about the things I could accept in Porto or Mergellina: women could have freedom over their own bodies, could live together without marrying. But in our Mergellina, I couldn't accept it, because it involved my sister's future, and I just couldn't calm down.\n[1974-11-11 19:22:10] Elisha Apartment Elevator | I thought about Elena marrying a dangerous person like Marcello and starting a family. Would my mother be happy?\n[1974-11-11 19:22:20] Elisha Apartment Elevator | I thought about how we got married at the city hall, without a religious ceremony, and how she was so angry at the time.\n[1974-11-11 19:22:30] Elisha Apartment Elevator | I thought about how she considered Lina a prostitute because she was living with Enzo, and how she saw Pinocchia as a shameless woman because she became Stefano's mistress. But now she was accepting her own younger daughter sleeping with Marcello—a bad man—without being married?\n[1974-11-11 19:23:00] At the entrance of Elisa's apartment | I thought that way when I reached Elena's doorstep. I thought my anger was justified, but my mind—my trained mind—was in chaos, and I didn't know what arguments I had to make.\n[1974-11-11 19:23:10] At the entrance of Elisa's apartment | Would I stand in my mother's shoes? Just as she reacted when I made the decision to get married a few years ago? Am I going back, clinging to the ideas she has already given up on?\n[1974-11-11 19:23:20] Elisha Apartment Entrance | I think, or I would say: \"You can be with whoever you want, but not with Marcello.\" Would I really say that? But now, in Mergellina, in Porto, which girl could I tell to leave the man she loves, no matter who he is?",

    "text": "[1974-11-11 19:25:00] Elena's Apartment Interior | When I saw Elena opening the door for me, I hugged her tightly, so hard that she laughed. I heard, \"You're hurting me.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:30:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her tell me to sit in the living room. I saw a very luxurious living room, filled with patterned sofas and individual armchairs with golden backs.\n[1974-11-11 19:35:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw her start talking nonstop, circling around the subject, saying I looked very healthy, that my earrings were beautiful, that my necklace was beautiful, that I was so elegant, and how much she wanted to meet Dede and Elsa right away. I thought I sensed she was a bit guilty.\n[1974-11-11 19:40:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw myself enthusiastically mentioning my two daughters, I took off the earrings, had her try them on in front of the mirror, and then gave the earrings to her. I saw her face brighten, and she smiled.\n[1974-11-11 19:41:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her say it in a low voice. I heard, \"I was worried you were here to scold me, to say you're against me being with Marcello.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:42:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I watched her for a while and then said. I heard, \"Elena, I'm against it. I came all this way just to tell you, tell Mom, Dad, and our brothers, I strongly oppose you being with him.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:43:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her face change, her eyes filled with tears. I heard, \"You hurt me, why are you opposing it?\"\n[1974-11-11 19:43:10] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"The Solara family is no good.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:43:20] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"Marcello is different.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:45:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her start talking to me about Marcello. I know she said, everything started when I was pregnant with Elsa. My mother went to Mergellina to take care of me, and the burden of the family fell entirely on her shoulders.\n[1974-11-11 19:46:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I once saw her buying things at the Solara supermarket, and Rino, Lina's brother, said she could leave the shopping list and he would bring the items home for her. I knew that when Rino was speaking, she saw Marcello waving at her from a distance, indicating that it was his idea. From that moment on, Marcello began to circle around her, constantly trying to impress her.\n[1974-11-11 19:47:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I knew Elena was thinking: He's old, and I don't like him. But he kept appearing right in front of her, very polite, and not a single gesture or word hinted at the hateful things the Solara family had done.\n[1974-11-11 19:48:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I know Marcello is truly a good man, and being with him gives me a sense of security. He's strong and very caring; he's simply towering. Not only that, ever since he started being nice to Elisa, her life has changed.\n[1974-11-11 19:49:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw everyone, both inside and outside of Mergellina, start treating her like a queen. Everyone valued her, and that was a beautiful feeling, she told me. She still wasn't used to it by then. I heard her say, \"Before, you were nothing, but now even the rats in the sewers know your name. Of course, you wrote a book, you're famous now, and you've gotten used to this life full of attention, but I've never experienced anything like it—I'm absolutely stunned.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:50:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw her continue speaking. I heard myself say, \"I found out that nothing ever required my concern—Marcello handled everything. Whatever idea I had, he would carry it out. That was really exciting. The longer it went on, the more I liked him. Finally, I agreed to Marcello. Now, if I don't see him or hear him speak for a day, I can't sleep all night, and I'll cry uncontrollably.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:51:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought to myself that Elena was certain she was extremely lucky, incredibly lucky. I understood that I didn't have the courage to ruin her happiness, and besides, she hadn't given me any chance to object.\n[1974-11-11 19:52:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I kept hearing her say that Marcello was capable, responsible, handsome, and perfect. I know she was careful with every word she said, either distinguishing him from the other members of the Solara family or carefully mentioning them. She said his mother was very warm, his father had a bad stomach and hardly went out anymore. She also mentioned his deceased grandfather, and even Michele—after her contact with Michele, she felt he was different from what people said, he was more human.\n[1974-11-11 19:53:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her saying it to me. \"I heard him say, 'So you have to believe me. Since I was born, I've never felt this good, not even Mom, you know how she is, she supports me too. Dad, and Gianni and Peppe, they're all on my side. Not long ago, Gianni and Peppe were idle, but now Marcello has found them something to do, and they're making a lot of money.'\"\n[1974-11-11 19:54:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw what I said. I heard, \"If that's the case, then you two should get married.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:55:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | \"I heard her say, 'We will get married, but not now. After this period, we'll get married. Marcello said he has some business issues to resolve, some complicated things, plus his grandfather's funeral. That poor old man, by then was completely confused, couldn't walk or speak anymore. Thank God, He set him free.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:56:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"But once these things are sorted out, we'll get married, don't worry. Plus, before getting married, we'd better try it out, see if the two of us are compatible, right?\"\n[1974-11-11 19:57:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw and then she said some more things, none of which were her own words, but rather phrases that those young, fashionable girls had read in the newspaper. I thought about comparing what she said with what I might have said on these topics, and I felt the difference probably wasn't very big—Elena's words would just be rougher.\n[1974-11-11 19:58:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | What could I possibly argue? Before I came, I didn't know how to speak, and now I still don't know how to speak. I should have said, \"There's nothing to expect, Elena. Everything is clear. Marcello will consume you, get used to your body, and then abandon you.\"\n[1974-11-11 19:58:10] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I thought of saying those words, but they sounded too outdated; even my mother wouldn't dare say them to her now, so I gave up.\n[1974-11-11 19:59:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought about how I had left, how I had freed myself from this place, but Elena was still here. If I had stayed, what would I have become? What choices would I have made? As a child, hadn't I also liked the Solara brothers?\n[1974-11-11 19:59:10] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought, besides this, what benefit would I gain by leaving? I couldn't even find wise words to persuade my sister not to destroy herself.\n[1974-11-11 20:00:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I look at Elena's face, which is beautiful and delicate, her figure is also well-proportioned, and her voice is soft.\n[1974-11-11 20:00:10] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I thought about what I remembered: Marcello was tall and handsome, with a square face, healthy skin, and all over muscular. He was capable of maintaining a lasting and intense emotion for a woman: when he fell in love with Lina, he already showed this, and from that time on, there were no other affairs reported. What else can I say?\n[1974-11-11 20:01:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw it all, and finally, she took a box and showed me the jewelry Marcello had given her. I thought that compared to those jewelry pieces, the earrings I had just given her were nothing at all.",

Call me if you need anything.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:03:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I tried to stand up and leave, but she smiled and stopped me, saying. \"I heard, 'Where are you going? Didn't your mother tell you? Everyone is coming here to eat, and I've prepared a lot of food.'\"\n[1974-11-11 20:03:10] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself asking, somewhat unwillingly. \"I heard, 'Everyone? Who all?' \"\n[1974-11-11 20:03:20] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"Everyone, this is a surprise.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:10:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw my parents come in first, then my two children and Pietro followed.\n[1974-11-11 20:11:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena giving Dede and Elsa many gifts, doting on them a lot. \"I heard, 'Dede, sweetie, kiss me; Elsa, you're really strong, come to your auntie, do you know, our names are the same.'\"\n[1974-11-11 20:12:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw my mother disappear immediately into the kitchen, her head down, not looking at me.\n[1974-11-11 20:13:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Pietro trying to pull me aside to tell me something more important, but he didn't get to say what he wanted to. I thought his expression seemed to say that he was innocent.\n[1974-11-11 20:14:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw my father pull him down onto a sofa in front of the TV, and they turned the volume up very loud.\n[1974-11-11 20:20:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that after a while, Giyao and her children appeared, those two son-like bandits, who quickly became friends with Dede. I saw Giya oLa had just gotten her hair done, clinking and clanking in high-heeled leather shoes. Her ears, neck, and arms were all glittering with gold jewelry.\n[1974-11-11 20:21:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that Elsa was very worried, and she wouldn't stop clinging to me. I saw Geyola forcing herself into a bright green dress, with a low neckline, and she had put on heavy makeup that was starting to run.\n[1974-11-11 20:22:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her open the door and speak to me directly, full of sarcasm. I heard, \"We've all come specially to pay our respects to you, the great professors. Everything okay? Elena, is this the genius from the university? My God! Your husband's hair is really nice.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:23:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | At that moment, Pietro pulled himself free from my father's arm on his shoulder, suddenly stood up, and smiled shyly, his eyes automatically drawn to the waves on Giggia's chest.\n[1974-11-11 20:24:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that she also realized it, and she was somewhat smug as she said. \"I heard, 'Please sit down, please sit down, otherwise I'll feel embarrassed. Here, no one stands up to greet a lady.'\"\n[1974-11-11 20:25:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw my father pull my husband down to sit, and although the TV was loud, he began talking to Pietro. I thought he was worried someone might take Pietro away from him, but I didn't know what they were saying.\n[1974-11-11 20:30:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw I asked Giya how she was, I tried to hint her with my eyes, voice, and tone: I hadn't forgotten the things she'd told me, I was on her side. I thought of her, but she seemed not to fall for it.\n[1974-11-11 20:31:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw her say it. I heard her say, \"Beauty, listen to me, I'm fine, you're fine, we're all fine. If it weren't for my husband making me come to this fucking party, I'd rather be at home. That's what I wanted to say.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:35:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I realized I couldn't think of a response, when someone knocked on the door. My sister went to open it lightly, like a breeze.\n[1974-11-11 20:35:10] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw and heard her shouting. I heard, \"I'm so happy! Please come in, Mother, please come in.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:36:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw, and then my sister appeared with her future mother-in-law, Manuela. I saw Manuela dressed in her festival clothes, her hair dyed red, a silk flower in her hair, her eyes full of pain sunken deep into their sockets. She was thinner than the last time I saw her, almost skeletal.\n[1974-11-11 20:37:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele behind her. I saw that he was also well-dressed, his beard neatly shaved, his gaze and movements both sharp and steady.\n[1974-11-11 20:38:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that after a while, a huge man appeared, and for a moment I didn't recognize who he was. I saw that his whole body was huge: he was very tall, had big feet, long and thick legs, and his belly, neck, and shoulders seemed to be made of very strong and heavy material. His head was also large, with a broad forehead, long black hair tied back, and his beard was dark gray and shiny.\n[1974-11-11 20:39:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it was Marcello, Elena's lips moved toward him, and he bent down [intimate act] with Elena. I thought of him as a deity who deserved respect and worship.\n[1974-11-11 20:40:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | At that moment, my father stood up and, somewhat flustered, pulled Pietro up as well. My mother also limped out of the kitchen. I thought to myself that the presence of Signora Solara was a special and praiseworthy event.\n[1974-11-11 20:41:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena excitedly saying in my ear. I heard, \"Today is my mother-in-law's sixtieth birthday.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:41:05] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I said what I saw. I heard \"Ah.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:42:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I was surprised at this moment too, when Marcello spoke directly to my husband as if they had already known each other.\n[1974-11-11 20:43:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him smile, revealing his dazzling white teeth, and he said loudly. I heard, \"Everything okay, Professor?\"\n[1974-11-11 20:44:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw Pietro with a very puzzled smile on his face, he looked at me and shook his head, bewildered. What if everything is fine? It's like saying: I've done my best.\n[1974-11-11 20:45:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I wanted to ask him to explain, but at that moment, Marcello had already started introducing Manuela to him. I heard, \"Come here, Mama, this is Elena's husband, a university professor. Come and sit in front of him.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:46:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Pietro lean forward slightly in greeting. I thought I also needed to greet Mrs. Solara.\n[1974-11-11 20:47:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her say it. I heard, \"You're really beautiful, Elena, just like your sister.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:47:10] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw and then she asked me with a touch of anxiety. I heard, \"It's too hot in here, don't you feel it?\"\n[1974-11-11 20:48:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I didn't answer because at that moment Dede was crying and calling my name. I thought of Giggia--the only one who didn't care about Manuela's appearance, who cursed her two sons in dialect for bullying my daughter.\n[1974-11-11 20:49:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself greeting him loudly, then I went over to comfort Dede and console Elsa. When Elsa saw her sister crying, she started to cry too. I thought about it, and I realized Michele was silently studying me; he hadn't even said \"hello\" to me.\n[1974-11-11 20:50:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Marcello saying to me. I heard, \"I'm very happy to have you in my home; it's a great honor for me, I mean it.\"",

I heard, \"Tell your sister I'm happy, I'm a little scared of your sister.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:52:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I said a few words to reassure him, and just then, someone knocked on the door.\n[1974-11-11 20:53:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that this time it was Michele who opened the door, and he came back quickly, his face full of something strange, followed by an elderly man dragging a suitcase. I thought it was my luggage, the luggage I had left at the hotel.\n[1974-11-11 20:54:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele pointing at me, and the man put his luggage in front of me. I thought it was like a magic trick, amusing me.\n[1974-11-11 20:55:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself saying it out loud. \"I heard, 'No! No, you're going to make me angry this way.'\"\n[1974-11-11 20:56:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw but Elisa embraced me, kissed my face, and said. I heard, \"You can't stay in a hotel. We have a place here with many rooms and two bathrooms.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:57:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw, no matter what, Marcello emphasized. \"I didn't dare do this without first getting your husband's permission. Professor, please, talk to your wife, convince her to say a few words for us.\"\n[1974-11-11 20:58:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw I was somewhat flustered and very angry, but I still said with a smile. \"I heard, 'My God, it's really a mess. Thank you, Marce, I appreciate your kindness, but we can't stay here.'\"\n[1974-11-11 20:59:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I wanted to tell the man to take the luggage back to the hotel, but I also had to comfort Dede, so I said to her. I heard, \"Let me see, what did they do to you? It's okay, just a kiss and it'll be fine. Go play, take Elsa with you.\"\n[1974-11-11 21:00:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw and then called out to Pietro, who was already by Manuela's side. I heard, \"Pietro, come here for a moment, please. What did you say to Marcello? We can't stay here.\"\n[1974-11-11 21:01:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought about how, because of my excitement, my accent had become very strong, and I used some words from Naples' Mergellina.\n[1974-11-11 21:02:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought of the courtyard, the main road, and the other place, all forcing their language and way of behaving onto me. The image of the first place suddenly faded, becoming a phantom, while everything here was real and vivid.\n[1974-11-11 21:05:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw the door ring again, and Elena ran to open it. Who else could it be?\n[1974-11-11 21:06:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it for a few seconds, then Gennaro rushed into the room. He saw Dede, and when Dede saw him, she was also shocked and immediately stopped making noise. I thought about how they were all looking at each other with excitement, this reunion was too unexpected for them.\n[1974-11-11 21:07:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Enzo come next. He was the only blond man; all the others had black hair. His expression was serious. The last one to come in was Lina.\n[1974-11-11 21:10:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I thought about the long period we spent without seeing each other, when we only kept in touch by phone, and how this time suddenly came to an end.\n[1974-11-11 21:11:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Lina wearing a blue dress that ended just above her knees. She was very thin, almost skeletal, which made her look even taller, although she was wearing low-heeled shoes.\n[1974-11-11 21:12:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw the deep wrinkles at the corners of her mouth and around her eyes. Her skin was very pale, and the skin on her forehead and cheekbones was tight. She had tied her hair into a ponytail, revealing the outline of her ears, and she had almost no earlobes.\n[1974-11-11 21:13:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her smile as soon as she saw me, her eyes narrowing.\n[1974-11-11 21:14:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw that I wasn't smiling, and I was so astonished that I couldn't say a word, not even a \"hello.\" I thought, even though we're both thirty, she looked much older than me, and I felt I had fewer wrinkles.\n[1974-11-11 21:15:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Geyao la shout something. I heard, \"Another queen has finally made her appearance. The children are all hungry, and I can't control them anymore.\"\n[1974-11-11 21:20:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I watched as we started eating, and I felt myself trapped, unable to swallow the dinner. I thought about my anger as I thought about my luggage. After arriving at the hotel, I took out my luggage, and now they've taken everything back again—my things, Pietro's, and the two children's, touched by the hands of one or several strangers.\n[1974-11-11 21:25:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I couldn't accept the fact that I had to sleep at Marcello's house so that my sister would be happy, because they slept in the same bed.\n[1974-11-11 21:30:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself looking at Elena and my mother with my eyes. I thought of a kind of estrangement and hostility that made me feel sad.\n[1974-11-11 21:35:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena talking nonstop, playing the role of the hostess. I thought of her being swept away by a feverish happiness.\n[1974-11-11 21:40:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw my mother looking very happy, so happy that she even politely added a full plate of food to Lina's dish.\n[1974-11-11 21:45:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I watched Enzo, who was eating with his head down, annoyingly impatient with Giggia. I thought of her huge chest pressed against his arm, of her speaking to him in the voice of a wealthy woman, loud and commanding.\n[1974-11-11 21:50:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw myself looking at Pietro with some resentment. I thought that even though he was sitting next to my father, Marcello, and Signora Solara, he was still most attentive to Lina.\n[1974-11-11 21:55:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Lina sitting across from him. She was indifferent to everyone, including me—perhaps especially to me—but she was very attentive to Pietro.\n[1974-11-11 22:00:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I found a few kids really annoying too: five little lives, already divided into two factions, Gennaro and Dede teaming up against the two sons of Giggia. I thought about how they drank wine from my mother's cup, and it was becoming unbearable, yet Elsa actually liked them and wanted to join forces with them, even though they didn't care about her at all.\n[1974-11-11 22:05:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I wondered who was directing this play, who had brought all these different people together. It was definitely Elena. Who had prompted her to do it? Perhaps Marcello, but Marcello was certainly acting on Michele's orders.\n[1974-11-11 22:10:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele sitting beside me, eating and drinking comfortably. He pretended not to notice his wife and the children. He looked at my husband with a teasing gaze, and my husband seemed to be enchanted by Lina.\n[1974-11-11 22:15:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | What was Michele trying to say? Was this Solara's territory? Even though I had escaped, I still belonged to this place, and therefore to them?\n[1974-11-11 22:15:10] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I thought that, therefore, they could impose everything upon me, using emotions, words, and rituals, but at the same time they could also destroy them as they pleased, turning the ugly into the beautiful, and the beautiful into the ugly?\n[1974-11-11 22:20:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I didn't even have time to speak when Michele came in, and the first thing he said to me was. \"I heard her say, 'Have you seen my mother? She's already sixty, but who could tell? Look how beautiful and young she is, isn't she?'\"\n[1974-11-11 22:21:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him deliberately raising his voice so that everyone could hear his question, and I had no choice but to answer him. I also had to say a few words of praise about his mother.\n[1974-11-11 22:25:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her sitting next to Pietro now. She was an old woman who seemed a bit dazed, bony and thin, with a long face, a large nose, and a strange flower stuck in her sparse hair. I thought she was very polite, and on the surface, she looked very innocent.\n[1974-11-11 22:30:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I thought that no matter what, she was a usurer, the one who brought wealth to our family. She guarded that red notebook, which contained the names of many people in this Mergellina, this city, and this province.",

    "text": "[1974-11-11 22:31:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought this was the woman who only committed crimes but never faced punishment, a very ruthless and dangerous woman. According to my and Lina's conversation on the phone, as well as the fragments from my aborted novel, this woman was the one who killed Don Achille and then took his place, monopolizing the usury business. She educated her two sons to take everything, to step on everyone.\n[1974-11-11 22:35:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it now, and I had to say it to Michele. I heard, \"Yes, really, your mother is beautiful, she looks very young, really like that.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:36:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself looking at Lina out of the corner of my eye. She stopped talking to Pietro, turned to look at me, her lips half-closed, her eyes narrowed, her brow furrowed.\n[1974-11-11 22:37:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw mockery on her face. I thought, maybe it was her who advised Michele to put me in such a situation: Elena, your sister's mother-in-law, your brother-in-law's mother, your mother is now sixty years old. Let's see what you'll say, let's see if you'll keep up this act.\n[1974-11-11 22:40:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I said to Manuela. I heard \"Wishing you all blessings!\" I thought there was nothing else to say.\n[1974-11-11 22:41:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Marcello quickly interjected, as if to help me, and he said loudly, moved. I heard, \"Thank you, thank you, Elena.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:42:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him say it to his mother. I heard, \"Mom, Elena has blessed you.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:43:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw his mother's face full of pain at that moment. I saw that her face was all sweaty, and there were patches of red rash on her thin neck.\n[1974-11-11 22:44:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that at this point, Pietro, who was sitting next to Manuela, also said. I heard, \"Madam, I also wish you a long and healthy life.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:45:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that everyone, except Giggia and Lina, had wished Madame Solara good luck, including several children who all spoke in unison. I heard, \"Long live you, Manuela, long live you, Grandma!\"\n[1974-11-11 22:46:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her looking a bit flustered and muttered something. I heard, \"I'm old.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:47:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her take out a sky-blue fan from her bag, printed with the smoking Mount Vesuvius and San Gregorio Armeno Bay. She began to fan herself slowly, then with increasing force.\n[1974-11-11 22:50:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that although Michele had been speaking to me, he seemed more concerned about my husband's blessing.\n[1974-11-11 22:51:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him speaking politely to my husband. I heard, \"Professor, you're too kind. You're not from around here, you don't know the merits of my mother.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:52:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw him speaking in a very serious tone. \"I heard, 'We all come from good families. My dear grandfather, may his soul rest in peace. He started a bar in a corner with nothing but his bare hands. My father expanded that bar, thanks to my father-in-law Spagnuolo's excellent skills. In the end, it became a famous pastry shop throughout the entire San Gregorio Armeno. My father-in-law's skills were really great, weren't they? Giorgio!\"\n[1974-11-11 22:53:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him add. \"I heard her say, 'All of this is thanks to my mother—the mother we both have. These days, everyone is envious and jealous, and they all want to undermine us, saying bad things about her. But we can all tolerate others; we've long been used to focusing on our own business and being patient, because the truth will always come out in the end. In fact, she's a very smart woman, strong-willed, and she never thought of taking it easy or doing nothing—she was always working, taking care of the family, and enjoying nothing. Everything we have now was created by her for us, and everything we're doing today is just continuing what she started.'\"\n[1974-11-11 22:55:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw that at this moment, Manuela's motion of fanning herself slowed down, and she shouted at Pietro. I heard someone say, \"Michele is a particularly filial son; he would stand on a table and recite poems at Christmas since childhood; his only flaw is that he talks too much and likes to exaggerate.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:56:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Marcello say something. I heard, \"No, Mom, what exaggeration! What he said is all true.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:57:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele continue to praise Manuela, saying how beautiful she was, how generous, going on and on until finally, he suddenly turned toward me, very seriously, even solemnly, and said. I heard, \"There's only one woman here who can rival our mother.\"\n[1974-11-11 22:58:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw another woman? One who could rival Signora Solara? I looked at him uneasily. I thought that although his words were somewhat out of place at that bustling dinner, for a moment everyone fell silent.\n[1974-11-11 22:59:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Giggia looking at her husband with an impatient expression. I saw eyes filled with alcohol and pain.\n[1974-11-11 23:00:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw my mother suddenly become serious. I thought maybe she wanted that woman to be Elena, that Michele was bestowing some power upon his daughter, allowing her to take the place of Signora Solara and sit at the top of the family hierarchy.\n[1974-11-11 23:01:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that at this moment, Manuela stopped fanning herself. She wiped the sweat from her lips with her index finger and waited for her son to make a joke that would undo everything he'd just said.\n[1974-11-11 23:02:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it, but he still acted as recklessly as usual, paying no attention to his wife, Enzo, and not even to his own mother.\n[1974-11-11 23:03:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him staring at Lina, his movements became very agitated, his words like hooks, trying to draw Lina's attention away from Pietro, who she had been talking to. I saw that at this moment, his face had turned a bit green.\n[1974-11-11 23:04:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him say it. \"I heard, 'Tonight, we are all here, at my brother's house. First, welcome two esteemed professors and their beautiful daughter; second, to celebrate my mother's birthday, she is a remarkable woman; third, to wish Elisa a wonderful wedding, which is soon coming; fourth, if allowed, to celebrate the achievement of an agreement I had been worried I might not be able to reach, Lina! Come here, please.'\"\n[1974-11-11 23:05:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I think of Lina, Lina.\n[1974-11-11 23:06:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself searching for her gaze, and the moment our eyes met, I felt as if she were saying: Now you understand the game, do you remember how to play?\n[1974-11-11 23:07:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw it, and under my stunned gaze, at that moment, Enzo stared at the tablecloth, and she calmly got up, walked over to Michele.\n[1974-11-11 23:08:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw that he didn't touch her, didn't even brush her hand or her arm. I thought that there was a blade between them, one that would hurt him.",

You're excellent. You've come so far. You're in the newspaper. You're a source of pride for all of us who've known you since you were a child. But I'm sure you'll agree with me, and you'll also be happy if I say this, because you love her too. Lila has something in her mind that others don't have—a very powerful, strong thing that jumps around, nothing can stop it. It's something even the doctors can't see. I think it's something she herself can't even recognize.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:10:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him continue to speak. \"I heard her say, 'Even though she's had this thing since childhood, she hasn't realized it, and she doesn't want to realize it. Look at her expression now, how resistant she is! If she's not satisfied, she can cause a lot of trouble. If she wants to, she can make everyone dialogueless. Well, this talent of hers, I've wanted to buy it for a long time. Yes, I want to buy it, there's nothing wrong with that, just like buying pearls or diamonds. But so far, I haven't managed to do it.'\"\n[1974-11-11 23:11:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him say it. I heard myself say, \"But now, we've taken a step forward, a small one. Tonight, I just wanted to celebrate that small step: I've hired Mrs. Lina to work at the data processing center in Acela. It's a very modern place. If you're interested, Elena, or if the professor is, I can show you around any day before you leave tomorrow. What do you think, Lina?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:12:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Lina make a very annoyed face, shaking her head unhappily and staring at Signora Solara. I heard him say, \"Michele doesn't understand IBM System at all. He thinks what I'm doing is really impressive, but actually it's simple—just take a correspondence course and you're good. I only have a fifth-grade education, but I learned it all anyway.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:13:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it, and then she said nothing else. She didn't mock Michele, or the thing he had imagined himself—that thing, alive and running around in her mind. I thought she would object, but she didn't. She didn't mock Michele for what he said about pearls and diamonds.\n[1974-11-11 23:14:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw, especially, that she didn't deny those compliments; instead, she had us celebrate her appointment as if she were truly gifted. I thought about how she had let Michele continue praising her, which made it clear that paying her so much money was entirely reasonable.\n[1974-11-11 23:15:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | At that moment, I saw Pietro—easily at ease among those he considered beneath him—saying without even asking me that he wanted to go see the Capodimonte in Aciarella.\n[1974-11-11 23:16:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him make Lina sit back down and tell him in detail about things related to IBM System.\n[1974-11-11 23:17:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought of a moment when I considered, if I gave her time, she would take away my husband just as she had taken Nino from me, yet I felt absolutely no jealousy at all.\n[1974-11-11 23:18:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought that if such a thing happened, it would only serve to dig a deeper chasm between us. I felt she wouldn't like Pietro, and Pietro wouldn't betray me for another woman.\n[1974-11-11 23:19:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I thought about it, but at that moment, I instead experienced another more chaotic and indistinct emotion. In the place where I was born, everyone had always believed that I was the most successful girl. At that time, I was absolutely certain that this was an undeniable fact.\n[1974-11-11 23:20:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought of Michele, as if he were deliberately trying to undermine me in Mergellina, especially my standing in my own family, so that Lina would completely surpass me. He even wanted me to acknowledge my own mediocrity and publicly affirm my friend's unparalleled abilities.\n[1974-11-11 23:21:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought that Lina herself was also happy to accept the outcome, and not only that, she even expressed her cooperation, pushing the result into being. Perhaps this was something she had designed, planned, and organized herself.\n[1974-11-11 23:22:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought that if a few years ago, I was still a somewhat famous writer, this wouldn't have hurt me at all, but instead would have made me happy. But now everything is over, and I feel very painful.\n[1974-11-11 23:23:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I exchanged a look with my mother, and she was frowning. I thought about the look on her face, which seemed to be one of forced restraint, as if she had only just managed to stop herself from slapping me.\n[1974-11-11 23:24:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I thought she wanted me not to act as usual, like someone who just wants to keep the peace. She wanted me to respond, to show off something refined, not the petty tricks from Acheri.\n[1974-11-11 23:25:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought that was what her gaze had told me, like a silent command, but I didn't speak.\n[1974-11-11 23:26:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw Manuela looking around with a tormented expression, and suddenly said. I heard, \"I feel really hot, don't you?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:30:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought of Elena as like my mother, and she too would not have been able to stand me losing my position. My mother was silent, but my younger sister was now speaking to me with enthusiasm and emotion, making it clear that I was still her greatest elder sister, the one who had always made her proud.\n[1974-11-11 23:31:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her suddenly jump to another topic, still using her usual cheerful tone, she said. I heard, \"There's something I need to tell you. Have you ever been on a plane?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:32:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I said I didn't.\n[1974-11-11 23:33:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw that among the people present, only Pietro had been on a plane a few times, but when he talked about it, he didn't think it was anything particularly impressive.\n[1974-11-11 23:34:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it, but for Elena and Marcello, it was a very magical experience. They went to Germany, partly for work and partly for pleasure.\n[1974-11-11 23:35:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena start to get scared, and finally, through the small window, she saw the white clouds below and the blue sky above. I saw her, and she could feel the impact of the air, a cold breeze rushing straight to my head.\n[1974-11-11 23:36:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her realize that the weather was always good above the clouds, and when passing over the mountain peaks, the snow-covered summits could be seen. I looked down from the sky, and the earth appeared green, blue, and purple.\n[1974-11-11 23:37:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw her asking me. I heard, \"Guess who we ran into in Düsseldorf?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:38:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself muttering unhappily. \"I don't know, Elena, you tell me.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:39:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard \"Antonio.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:39:10] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard \"Ah.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:40:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"He has mentioned several times and asked me to greet you.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:40:10] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"Is he okay?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:40:20] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"Very good, he asked me to bring you a gift.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:41:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her stand up and run to get the gift, and Marcello watched me with interest. I thought, so this is what she was going to give me, Antonio's gift.\n[1974-11-11 23:42:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Pietro asking. I heard, \"Who is Antonio?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:42:10] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Marcello say. I heard, \"One of our employees.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:43:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele smiling. I heard, \"Your wife's former boyfriend. Now the times have changed, Professor. These days, women have a lot of boyfriends, and they're even more showy than men. How many girlfriends have you had?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:44:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Pietro saying it very seriously. I heard, \"I don't have any other girlfriends; I've only ever loved my wife.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:45:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele jokingly shouting out. \"I heard, 'Lying, I can tell you how many girlfriends I've had.'\"\n[1974-11-11 23:46:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw him stand up, and under Giyao's very annoyed gaze, he walked behind my husband and muttered something in his ear.\n[1974-11-11 23:47:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Pietro say with a touch of mockery, and everyone laughed. I heard \"It's too incredible.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:48:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena return, and she handed me a package wrapped tightly in wrapping paper. I heard, \"Go ahead, open it.\"",

I heard, \"Do you know what's inside?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:50:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Marcello say. I heard, \"We both know, but we want to surprise you.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:51:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw myself opening the wrapping paper, and I realized that everyone's eyes were on me when I opened the wrapping paper. I thought especially of Lina, who looked at me sideways with great suspicion, as if she were afraid a snake might jump out of the package.\n[1974-11-11 23:52:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw their faces fall when they realized that Antonio—the son of the madwoman Melina, a very violent young man, half-servant to the Solara family, my boyfriend in my teenage years, and almost illiterate—had not given me something touching, beautiful, and evocative of the past, but only a book.\n[1974-11-11 23:53:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw it, but they noticed my face changed. I looked at the book's cover with an uncontainable joy. I thought it wasn't just any book, it was my book, the German version of my novel, which had finally been published six years after its Italian release.\n[1974-11-11 23:54:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I thought of my first performance of a wonderful show—yes, a very wonderful show—the words I had written appeared before my eyes through another language.\n[1974-11-11 23:55:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena asking very happily. I heard, \"You don't know anything at all?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:55:10] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I heard \"I don't know.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:55:20] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard, \"Are you happy?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:55:30] Elisha Apartment Living Room | \"I'm so happy.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:56:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw my sister proudly announcing to everyone. I heard, \"That's Elena's novel, the German version.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:57:00] Elisha's Apartment Living Room | I saw my mother's face turn bright red as she spoke with a sense of triumph. I heard, \"Look at her, how famous she is now.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:58:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Geyao la take the book, flip through it, and say with reverence. I heard, \"The only one I could understand was the name Elena Greco.\"\n[1974-11-11 23:59:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that at this moment, Lina reached out, her movement somewhat forceful, signaling to Ji Yao to let her see. I thought about how I saw curiosity in her eyes, how she longed to touch the book, to see that foreign language which carried my words to distant places. I saw how eagerly she wanted that object—the eagerness I knew well, one she'd had since childhood, and it moved me deeply.\n[1974-11-11 23:59:10] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw Donato Girolama violently push her away, preventing her from taking the book, she said. I heard, \"Wait, let me check first. Do you speak German too?\"\n[1974-11-11 23:59:20] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Lina pull her hand back and shake her head. Giorgio shouted loudly. \"I heard, 'Stop being annoying, let me see first. I want to take a good look at Elena's work, to see what she's capable of.'\"\n[1974-11-12 00:00:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her, in a silence, hold the book in her hands and look at it with satisfaction. She turned the pages very slowly, reading a few lines here and a few there.\n[1974-11-12 00:05:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it to the end, and then she returned the book to me, speaking to me in a slurred voice as if she were drunk. \"I heard, 'You're amazing, Elena. The book is great, your husband and kids are wonderful. Congratulations. I was thinking, only we know you, but actually the Germans know you too. Everything you have now is what you deserve. You've suffered to get it, and you haven't hurt anyone or stolen anyone's husband. Thank you. Now I should go home. Goodnight.'\"\n[1974-11-12 00:10:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her gasping for breath, struggling to stand up. She had drunk alcohol, making her body even heavier. She shouted at her two sons. I heard, \"Hurry up!\"\n[1974-11-12 00:11:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it, but they didn't want to leave. A bigger child said something dirty in the local dialect, and she raised her hand and slapped him, then pulled him to the door.\n[1974-11-12 00:12:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Michele smiling and shaking his head, muttering something. I heard, \"You see, what kind of life am I living with this scoundrel? She always ruins my good mood.\"\n[1974-11-12 00:13:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that, and he said calmly. I heard, \"Wait, Ji Yao, where are you going? We should try the dessert your father made first, and then go home.\"\n[1974-11-12 00:14:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I heard my father's words, and the two children immediately perked up. They pulled themselves free from their mother's hand and returned to the table.\n[1974-11-12 00:15:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Geyola still standing at the door, and she said angrily. I heard, \"I'll go back alone, I'm not feeling well.\"\n[1974-11-12 00:16:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw it just then, when Michele spoke in a harsh and violent tone. I heard, \"Come here right away and sit down!\"\n[1974-11-12 00:17:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that at this moment, Geyao La's movements froze, as if her legs had been paralyzed by his words.\n[1974-11-12 00:18:00] Elena's Apartment Living Room | I saw Elena stand up suddenly and say. I heard, \"Come on, accompany me to get the dessert.\"\n[1974-11-12 00:19:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her grab Yiyao's arm and pull her into the kitchen. I looked at Dede with my eyes, trying to tell her not to be afraid, but Michele's shout had terrified her.\n[1974-11-12 00:20:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw that, so I handed the book to Lina and said to her. I heard, \"Do you want to see it?\"\n[1974-11-12 00:21:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw her gesture that it wasn't necessary. I saw a look of indifference on her face.\n[1974-11-12 01:00:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | After putting the two daughters to sleep, we entered the room Elisa had arranged for us, closed the door, and Pietro asked me half-jokingly, half-in shock. I heard, \"Where is this place? How did we end up here?\"\n[1974-11-12 01:05:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I realized he was referring to the most unbelievable moments of the night, but I spoke to him harshly, and we had a quiet argument. I thought about being angry at him, angry at everyone, and even angry at myself.\n[1974-11-12 01:10:00] Elena's Apartment Guest Room | I thought of the disturbing notion that I had wished for Lina to fall ill and die, not out of hatred, but because I still loved her the most. I couldn't hate her, but I couldn't bear the emptiness left behind when she walked away.\n[1974-11-12 01:15:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw myself saying to Pietro. I heard, \"How could you agree to have the luggage brought here, saying we're going to live in this house?\"\n[1974-11-12 01:15:10] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw him say it. I heard, \"I don't know who they are.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:15:20] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw myself saying it harshly to him. I said, \"You don't know? That's because you've never really listened to me. I told you from the beginning about my background.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:20:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw that we had argued for a long time, I tried to calm down, and I said a lot of bad things about him, I said. I heard, \"You're too timid, easily manipulated. You can only deal with the intellectual environment, with those who are well-educated.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:25:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I said what I saw. \"I don't believe you anymore, and I don't believe your mother either. Why has my book been published in Germany for two years, and the publisher never told me anything? It might have been published in other countries too, but I don't know anything about it. I need to get to the bottom of this.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:30:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw that in order to calm me down, he said he agreed with me, and told me to call his mother and my publisher the next morning. I heard, \"She is the one who makes me the most uneasy.\" I thought about how, in the end, he confessed that he really liked the environment where I was born and raised—the life of the common people, as he called it. He said my mother was a generous and very smart woman, and he spoke highly of my father, Elena, Giggia, and Enzo. Suddenly, he changed the subject and started talking about the Solara brothers. He said they were two rascals, two lying scoundrels. Finally, he mentioned Lina, speaking softly.\n[1974-11-12 01:31:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I couldn't help but burst out, I said. I heard, \"I found out you've been talking to her all night.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:32:00] Elena's Apartment Guest Room | I saw but Pietro shook his head very forcefully, and to my surprise, he explained that he thought Lina was the worst of all.",

    "text": "[1974-11-12 01:33:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw him say it. I heard, \"She's not really your friend at all. She actually hates you. She's so smart and charming, but her intelligence is misused. It's a wicked kind of smartness that plants seeds of chaos in life. Her charm is the most unbearable thing, a force that destroys people, really.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:35:00] Elena's Apartment Guest Room | I saw that at first, when he said these things, I pretended to disagree with him, but in my heart I was actually happy. I thought, so I had misjudged her earlier. In front of Pietro, Lina couldn't show her charm; he was a man trained to see the subtext in any text, and it was easy for him to detect her other side.\n[1974-11-12 01:36:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw it, but I soon thought he was exaggerating, he said. \"I couldn't understand how your relationship could last so long. Obviously, both of you are carefully nurturing it, hiding everything that could ruin it.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:37:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw him add. I heard, \"Either you don't really know her, and that's the most worrying thing.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:38:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I saw it through, and he said the worst thing. I heard her say, \"She and that Michele are absolutely perfect for each other. If they're not lovers now, they'll surely become lovers soon.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:39:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I couldn't take it anymore, and I said. I heard, \"I can't stand your bourgeois intellectual tone. You'd better not talk about my friend like that, because you don't understand anything.\"\n[1974-11-12 01:40:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I realized that at the moment I spoke these words, I had noticed something he had not yet realized: Lina had deeply attracted him.\n[1974-11-12 01:41:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I thought that Pietro had already sensed something different, and now he was afraid, so he urgently needed to belittle her. I felt that it wasn't himself he was worried about, but me, and our marriage.\n[1974-11-12 01:42:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I thought about his fear, that even from afar, Lina could take me away from him, destroy us all, and in order to protect me, he exaggerated, he slandered Lina, but in a confused way, he wanted me to hate her, to remove her from my life.\n[1974-11-12 01:45:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I muttered goodnight to myself and turned over to sleep on the other side.\n[1974-11-12 07:00:00] Elisha Apartment Guest Room | I woke up very early the next day, and I had already packed my luggage. I thought about wanting to go back to Mergellina right away, but I couldn't set off.\n[1974-11-12 07:30:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I saw Marcello say. I heard, \"I've already promised my younger brother that I would take you to Aciarello to see it.\"\n[1974-11-12 07:35:00] Elisha Apartment Living Room | I tried every way I could to make Pietro understand that I wanted to leave. I thought about it, but he said he was very willing to go.\n[1974-11-12 09:00:00] Acerra | I saw that we had Elena take care of the children, while the tall, strong man drove us to a low, yellow building. I saw a row of long sheds before me, which were the warehouse for shoes.\n[1974-11-12 09:10:00] In Marcello's car | I said nothing all the way, and Pietro asked about the Solara brothers' business in Germany.\n[1974-11-12 09:15:00] In Marcello's car | I saw Marcello speak incoherently for a few words. I heard, \"Italy, Germany, the whole world, Professor! I want to be more revolutionary than those revolutionaries. If I could overthrow everything and start from scratch, I would be the first one in line.\"\n[1974-11-12 09:16:00] In Marcello's car | I saw later, he was looking at me in the rearview mirror. I thought he wanted my approval, these words were meant for me, and he really cared about my reaction.\n[1974-11-12 09:30:00] Capodimonte | I saw that after arriving at our destination, he led us into a house with a low ceiling and fluorescent lighting. I remember most vividly the strong smell of ink and dust, mixed with the scent of shoe leather and shoe polish.\n[1974-11-12 09:35:00] Capodimonte | I saw Marcello say. I heard, \"This is the thing Michele rented.\"\n[1974-11-12 09:36:00] Capodimonte | I looked around and saw that no one was in front of the machine. I saw \"IBM System\" was unremarkable, like a piece of furniture, leaning against the wall: metal panels, a handle, a red switch, a wooden cabinet, and a keyboard.\n[1974-11-12 09:40:00] Capodimonte | I heard, \"This is Lina's doing, but she doesn't have a specific work schedule—she's always out there.\" I thought I didn't understand at all, Marcello said.\n[1974-11-12 09:45:00] Capodimonte | I saw Pietro carefully examining the metal plates, the handles, and other things. I thought it was obvious that this modern thing disappointed him.\n[1974-11-12 09:50:00] Capodimonte | I saw, especially, that whenever he asked a question, Marcello would answer. I heard, \"This is my younger brother's matter; I have other things to worry about.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:00:00] Capodimonte | I saw Lina appear just as we were about to leave. I saw her with two young women, both of whom were carrying a metal box.\n[1974-11-12 10:01:00] Capodimonte | I saw her looking very angry, giving the two women orders with a wave of her hand.\n[1974-11-12 10:02:00] Capodimonte | I saw her—when she saw us, her tone changed. She spoke to us with a feigned enthusiasm. I thought that her mind had finally managed to break free from the urgent work she had to deal with.\n[1974-11-12 10:03:00] Capodimonte | I saw her completely ignore Marcello, speaking directly to Pietro as if she were talking to me.\n[1974-11-12 10:04:00] Capodimonte | I saw her speak in a sarcastic tone, saying, \"How come you're interested in these things? If you're really interested, we can switch places.\" I heard, \"You work here, I'll do your thing, study novels, paintings, and ancient culture.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:05:00] Capodimonte | I thought again how she seemed older than me, not just in appearance, but in her movements, her voice, and the choices she made in speaking—she didn't care much about these things, which made her a bit annoying.\n[1974-11-12 10:10:00] Capodimonte | I saw her explain the system and the machine's operation to us. I heard about those disks, tapes, 5-inch floppy disks, and other new things, like the new personal computers that were emerging.\n[1974-11-12 10:15:00] Capodimonte | I saw her speaking about the new job in a very childish way. I thought she was no longer the Lina on the phone, as far away from Enzo's kind of passion as ever.\n[1974-11-12 10:20:00] Capodimonte | I saw her now acting just like a super competent employee, entrusted by her boss with the important task of introducing these things to us like a tour guide.\n[1974-11-12 10:25:00] Capodimonte | I saw that she never joked with Pietro, and she didn't speak to me in a friendly way either.\n[1974-11-12 10:30:00] Capodimonte | I watched until she had the two girls demonstrate to my husband how the punch machine worked.\n[1974-11-12 10:40:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I saw that later, we stopped in the corridor, she said. \"I heard, 'Well? Are you happy for Elena? How did you sleep at Marcello's? That old witch is sixty, aren't you glad?'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:40:10] Corridor 017 | I said irritably. I heard, \"If my sister were to do that, what could I do? Should I break her head?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:40:20] Corridor: Capodimonte | \"I heard, 'You see? In fairy tales, you can do whatever you want, but in reality, you can only do what you can.'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:40:30] Corridor 017 | I heard, \"This isn't true. Who forced you to do things for Michele?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:40:40] Corridor Capodimonte | I heard myself say, \"It's me using him, not him using me.\"",

Forget it.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:41:20] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard, \"I'll say it again—I don't like the way you're acting right now. You don't even understand our situation, so you'd better shut up.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:41:30] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard, \"You mean, only if I live in San Gregorio Armeno do I have the right to criticize you?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:41:40] Corridor 017 | \"I heard 'San Gregorio Armeno, Mergellina, you can't make anything out anywhere, Elena.'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:41:50] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard, \"Who said that?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:42:00] Corridor 017 | I heard, \"This is the truth.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:42:10] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard, \"I know what I should do, not what you think.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:42:20] Corridor Capodimonte | I acted on impulse, and she realized it; she made a compromising expression.\n[1974-11-12 10:42:30] Corridor: Capodimonte | \"I heard, 'You really made me angry, making me say things I didn't want to say. It was right for you to leave San Gregorio Armeno, you did well. Do you know who's back now?'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:42:40] Corridor of Capodimonte | I heard \"Who?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:42:50] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard \"Nino.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:43:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I thought of the news, and a sharp pain shot through my chest.\n[1974-11-12 10:43:10] Corridor Capodimonte | I heard, \"How did you know?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:43:20] Corridor 017 | I heard, \"It was Pinocchio who told me, he got a university position.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:43:30] Corridor 017 | I heard, \"Is he not good at Porto?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:43:40] Corridor of Capodimonte | I saw Lina blink, and she said. I heard, \"He married a woman from Tasso Street, whose family was from San Gregorio Armeno Bank. They have a one-year-old child.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:44:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I thought about how I didn't know what I was feeling at that time, whether I was sad or not—I just found it hard to believe what had happened.\n[1974-11-12 10:44:10] Corridor Capodimonte | I heard, \"He really got married?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:44:20] Corridor 017 | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:44:30] Corridor 017 | I looked at her, trying to figure out what she was thinking, and I asked. I heard, \"Are you going to meet him?\"\n[1974-11-12 10:44:40] Corridor of Capodimonte | \"I heard, 'No. But if you see him, tell him that Gennaro isn't his.'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:50:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I saw later, and she still spoke these words incoherently. I heard her say, \"Congratulations, your husband is handsome and smart. When he speaks, he's like a priest, even though he isn't religious. He knows everything from the past to the present, especially about San Gregorio Armeno. He knows too much, which makes me feel ashamed. I'm a native of San Gregorio Armeno, yet I know nothing about it.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:51:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard, \"Gennaro has grown up now, most of the time it's my mother who takes care of him. He does well in school. Enzo and I are both fine, we're both very busy now, and we don't spend much time together.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:52:00] Corridor of Capodimonte | I heard that \"Stefano destroyed himself: the police found something stolen in his shop, I don't know exactly what, and they took him away. He's been released now, but he has to be very careful. He has nothing left, and now it's me giving him money, not the other way around.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:53:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard her say, \"You see, how unpredictable life is. If I were still Mrs. Calogero, I would have been ruined too, just like the Calogeros. But now I'm Lina Lina, I'm in charge of Michele's CNC center, and I earn forty-two million lire a month.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:54:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard her say, \"In the end, my mother treated me like a queen, my father had already completely forgiven me, my brother kept taking money from me all along, and Pinocchia said she loved me, and their child calls me Auntie.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:55:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I heard her say, \"This is a very boring job, completely different from how I felt at the beginning. It's slow, takes a lot of time. I hope the new machine will be developed quickly, so we can move faster. Oh, but we can't do it that way, speed will swallow everything, like when you take a photo and your hands aren't steady, the picture is blurry. Alfonso Carracci said that, and he was just joking, saying it's like himself, coming out too fast without clear edges.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:56:00] Corridor of Capodimonte | \"I heard him say, 'In recent times, he's been talking to me about friendship. He really wants to be my friend. He wants to learn everything from me, like a carbon copy. He even swore that he wants to be a woman like me.' I told him, 'What woman, Alfonso Carracci? You're a man. You don't even know what I'm like. Even though we're friends, you've studied me, imitated me, but in the end, you still know nothing.'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:57:00] Corridor Capodimonte | I heard him say, \"So— he joked— what am I supposed to do? It's a torment being myself. He told me he's always loved Michele, yes, that Michele— he wants Michele to love him the way I love you.\"\n[1974-11-12 10:58:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | \"I heard him say, 'You know, Elena, what will happen to us: we have too much inside us, it will make us swell up, it will make us burst. I said to him, okay, we're friends, but don't think you can become a woman like me, you can only be the kind of woman that men like you see. You can imitate me, you can copy my appearance as skillfully as an artist, but my mess is mine, and your mess is yours.'\"\n[1974-11-12 10:59:00] Corridor of Capodimonte | I heard her say, \"Ah, Elena, what's happened to us? It's terrible how unhappy we've become. Do you remember how we dealt with that wedding photo? I'm going to keep doing it this way. One day, I'll turn myself into a computer mode, into a card with holes, and then you won't be able to find me anymore.\"\n[1974-11-12 11:00:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I saw her laughing later, that's all.\n[1974-11-12 11:05:00] Corridor Capodimonte | I thought about our conversation in the hallway, and once again it made me feel that our relationship was no longer secret. It had become just a series of brief, detailless news items and idle gossip. She didn't have any thoughts or facts that she would confide in me alone.\n[1974-11-12 11:10:00] Corridor of Capodimonte | I thought about Lina's life, which now belonged only to her, nothing else, as if she no longer wanted to share it with anyone.\n[1974-11-12 11:15:00] Corridor of Capodimonte | I thought asking such questions was pointless: Do you know what's happened to Pasquale now? Where is he? Is your death with Soca, and Philip breaking his leg, connected to this? What made you accept Michele's advice? Michele is really infatuated with you. What do you think about that? What does he want from you?\n[1974-11-12 11:20:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I thought that Lina didn't want to say anything now, and my curiosity and questions could no longer form a dialogue with her. She would say to me, \"What are you thinking? Are you crazy? Michele is obsessed with me, and Soca's death is related to me. What are you talking about?\"\n[1974-11-12 11:25:00] Corridor: Capodimonte | I think about it now, and as I write this memory down, I realize that back then I didn't have enough material to figure out how Lina planned, how she acted, or how she dealt with the problems she encountered.\n[1974-11-12 13:00:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought that even so, when I took the car back to Mergellina, I felt that in that town caught between backwardness and modernity, she had experienced more stories than I had.\n[1974-11-12 13:05:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought about all the things I missed after I left, and what kind of life I had imagined for myself.\n[1974-11-12 13:10:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought about Lina, who had stayed behind. She now had a brand-new job, earned a lot of money, and enjoyed complete freedom to act according to her own plans. Although I didn't know what she was really thinking deep down.\n[1974-11-12 13:15:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought about how she cared a lot for her son, having invested a lot in him from an early age, and she still did now. But it seemed she could free herself whenever she wanted. Her son wasn't as troublesome as my two daughters.\n[1974-11-12 13:20:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought about how she had already cut off ties with her family, even though she was still fulfilling her responsibilities. Whenever she could help her relatives, she would step in; she took care of Stefano when he was in trouble, but didn't get close to him; she hated the Solara brothers, yet still bowed to them; she made fun of Alfonso Carracci, but ended up becoming his friend.\n[1974-11-12 13:25:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought she said she never wanted to see Nino again, but I knew it wasn't true—she would see him again if the chance arose.\n[1974-11-12 13:30:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought her life was turbulent, while mine was stagnant.\n[1974-11-12 13:35:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I saw Pietro driving silently, while his two daughters argued, and I kept thinking about what might happen between her and Nino.",

    "text": "[1974-11-12 13:40:00] Back to the car at Mergellina | I thought to myself that Lina would get back together with him, that she would find a way to meet him, that she would use her own methods to keep him away from his wife and son. She would take advantage of him, start a war that was unclear whose target it was, and eventually make him divorce.\n[1974-11-12 13:45:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought that after getting a lot of money, she would leave Michele, abandon Enzo, and finally decide to divorce Stefano. She might marry Nino, or she might not. But with their combined intelligence, who could tell what kind of people they would become.\n[1974-11-12 13:50:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought of becoming--a word that had obsessed me, the first time I had used it in this context.\n[1974-11-12 13:55:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought about what I wanted to become—though I didn't know what I wanted to become, I had become—this much was certain, but there was no object following it. I had no real passion, no spontaneous ambition, and that was the problem.\n[1974-11-12 14:00:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought about what I had been turned into, just because I was worried: Lila might become someone else and leave me behind.\n[1974-11-12 14:05:00] Back to the car of Mergellina | I thought that my \"becoming\" was always along with her, but now I have to start over, becoming an independent person, freeing myself from her influence, and becoming myself.\n[1974-11-12 18:00:00] Vomero | I called Adele Airota as soon as I got home to find out what was going on with the German translation of my book, the one Antonio had given me.\n[1974-11-12 18:10:00] Vomero | I saw that she was also lost and clueless about it, so she called the publisher.\n[1974-11-12 18:30:00] Vomero | I saw that a while later, she called again and said to me that the book had not only been published in Germany, but also in France and Spain.\n[1974-11-12 18:31:00] Vomero | I said that at the moment. I heard, \"What should I do?\"\n[1974-11-12 18:32:00] Vomero | I saw Adele Airota's voice tremble slightly as she said. I heard, \"You don't need to do anything, it's a good thing.\"\n[1974-11-12 18:33:00] Vomero | I saw myself speaking hesitantly. \"I was certainly happy, but what specific thing am I supposed to do? For example, am I supposed to go abroad to promote it?\"\n[1974-11-12 18:34:00] Vomero | I saw her gently answer me. I heard, \"Elena, you don't need to do anything. Unfortunately, that book didn't sell anywhere.\"\n[1974-11-13 10:00:00] Vomero | I called the publisher to ask about the progress of my book's translation and publication. I thought about how my mood had turned terrible, and what made me angry was that no one had thought to inform me of these things.\n[1974-11-13 10:05:00] Vomero | I read until the end, and then I said to a disinterested clerk. I heard: \"I found out that my book was published in Germany, not from you, but from a semi-literate friend. How are you working?\"\n[1974-11-13 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw later, and I apologized to her, feeling very foolish myself.\n[1974-11-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw it all, and the translations into French, Spanish, and German were all sent to me. I saw that the German version wasn't as crumpled as the one Antonio had brought me.\n[1974-11-20 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw a woman in black on the cover, a man with a big mustache wearing a baseball cap, and clothes hanging outside. I thought about those translated versions; they were all very rough.\n[1974-11-20 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself leafing through these foreign editions, showing them to Pietro, and finally I placed them together with the other books on the shelf.\n[1974-11-20 10:11:00] Vomero | I thought of useless paper, silent paper.\n[1974-12-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought about how I had begun a weary, troubled time.\n[1974-12-01 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw myself calling Elisa every day, asking if Marcello was still so polite, asking if they had decided to get married.\n[1974-12-01 10:10:00] Vomero | I know that when she hears my chatter, she'll laugh happily and tell me about their happy life, the trips they take by car or plane, the progress of my two younger brothers, and how well our father and mother are doing now.\n[1974-12-01 10:15:00] Vomero | I sometimes feel jealous of her now.\n[1974-12-05 10:00:00] Vomero | I know Elsa is always sick, Dede wants to be noticed, and Pietro has never been able to finish his book. I thought about how tired and upset I was.\n[1974-12-05 15:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself getting angry over trivial matters, scolding the two children, and arguing with my husband. I thought the outcome would be that all three of them were afraid of me.\n[1974-12-05 15:05:00] Vomero | I saw it all, and whenever the two children saw me passing by their room, they would stop playing and look at me with suspicion.\n[1974-12-10 08:00:00] Vomero | I noticed that Pietro was spending more and more of his time in the university library instead of at home. He would leave early in the morning and return only in the evening.\n[1974-12-10 20:00:00] Vomero | When I saw him return, he seemed to carry the marks of a conflict. I thought to myself that I was now completely excluded from public life, and I could only read about these conflicts in the newspaper: Fascist members stabbing people, killing them, and the extreme leftists not backing down at all.\n[1974-12-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I know that the police now have legal permission to shoot, and this has already happened at Mergellina.\n[1974-12-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I knew that in the end, something inevitable happened: Pietro became the central figure in a terrible incident, which sparked various debates in the newspapers.\n[1974-12-20 10:05:00] Vomero | I know that once, he gave a student a failing grade, and that student was an active participant in the struggle.\n[1974-12-20 10:10:00] Vomero | I know that the young man cursed him in front of everyone and pointed a gun at him—not what he told me, but what a friend told me, a person who wasn't even there and heard it from someone else.\n[1974-12-20 10:15:00] University Classroom | At that moment, Pietro calmly wrote down the failing grade, returned the student ID to the boy, and then spoke clearly. I heard, \"You either shoot now or take the weapon away, because in a minute, once I leave this classroom, I'll go and report you.\"\n[1974-12-20 10:20:00] UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM 002 | I saw the boy holding a gun, pointing it at him for a long few seconds, then he put the gun back in his pocket and ran away with his student ID.\n[1974-12-20 10:30:00] Albergheria | I saw that, a few minutes later, Pietro went to Labor Office. I knew the student was about to be arrested.\n[1974-12-21 10:00:00] Vomero | I know, but the matter isn't over yet. The boy's parents didn't approach Pietro directly, but instead went straight to Pietro's father, asking him to persuade his son to drop the lawsuit.\n[1974-12-21 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw Guido Airota-Pietro trying to persuade his son; they had called each other many times, and each conversation lasted a long time.\n[1974-12-21 10:10:00] Vomero | What surprised me was that during the call, I heard Professor Pietro lose his patience and raise his voice, but Pietro didn't back down at all.\n[1974-12-21 10:15:00] Vomero | I watched until the end, and I was so excited that I asked him. I heard, \"Do you realize what you're doing?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:15:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Then what should I do?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:15:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Don't make things so tense.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:15:30] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't understand.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:15:40] Vomero | I heard, \"That's because you don't want to understand. You're just like some of the professors we had at Borgo, the ones who were the most annoying.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:15:50] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't think so.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:16:00] Vomero | I heard, \"It's true. You've already forgotten how hard we worked to pass those useless, meaningless exams—completely a waste of time.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:16:10] Vomero | I heard, \"My class isn't boring.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:16:20] Vomero | I heard, \"You'd better ask your student.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:16:30] Vomero | I heard, \"That's something you have to ask the people who are qualified to answer.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:16:40] Vomero | I heard, \"If I were your student, would you ask me?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:16:50] Vomero | I heard, \"I get along well with those who are truly studying.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:17:00] Vomero | I heard, \"So, you like those who fawn over you?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:17:10] Vomero | I heard, \"You like those arrogant people, just like your friend San Gregorio Armeno?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:17:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:17:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Then why have you always been studying so diligently?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:17:40] Vomero | I saw myself at a loss for words, and I said. I heard her say, \"Because I was poor before, making it this far is nothing short of a miracle.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:17:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Well, that boy has nothing in common with you.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:18:00] Vomero | I heard, \"You and I don't have anything in common either.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:18:10] Vomero | I heard, \"What did you want to say?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:18:20] Vomero | I saw that I hadn't answered, so I carefully avoided the topic.\n[1974-12-21 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw it, and then my anger flared up again. I started criticizing him for being so stubborn, and I said to him. I heard, \"You already failed him, what's the point in suing him again?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:20:10] Vomero | I saw him mutter something. I heard, \"This student has committed a crime.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:20:20] Vomero | I saw what I said. I heard, \"He just wanted to scare you, he's a child.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:20:30] Vomero | I saw him say it coldly. I heard, \"What he was holding was a gun, not a toy. It was something stolen seven years ago from Loverezzano Labor Office, along with other weapons.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:20:40] Vomero | I said what I saw. I heard, \"He didn't fire.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:20:50] Vomero | I saw him say angrily. I heard, \"The gun is loaded. What if he fires?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:21:00] Vomero | I saw he didn't fire, so I shouted, and he also raised his voice. I heard, \"Are you saying I have to wait for him to shoot me before I can sue him?\"\n[1974-12-21 10:21:10] Vomero | I saw myself shouting. I heard, \"Don't shout, you're too nervous.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:21:20] Vomero | I saw him answer. I heard, \"Think about yourself.\"\n[1974-12-21 10:22:00] Vomero | I was too excited, and no explanation to him would make any difference.\n[1974-12-21 10:22:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I was worried about you, about me, and the two children.\" I thought that although I couldn't help arguing with him, the situation at that time was really dangerous, and it made me very worried, I said.\n[1974-12-21 10:23:00] Vomero | I saw that he wouldn't comfort me, but instead locked himself in his room to write his book. I thought about how he hadn't made me feel at ease.",

    "text": "[1975-01-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I found out a few weeks later, when he finally told me. I know two plainclothes police officers have come by a few times, asking him about some students and showing him their photos.\n[1975-01-10 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw him greet them for the first time very politely, without giving them any information, and then send them away.\n[1975-01-10 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw it the second time, and he asked them. I heard, \"Have these young people committed crimes?\"\n[1975-01-10 10:10:10] Vomero | I heard, \"No, not yet.\"\n[1975-01-10 10:10:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Then what are you investigating?\"\n[1975-01-10 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw him escort the police officer to the door. I thought it was that kind of polite, yet distant and unapproachable attitude.\n[1975-02-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I knew Lina hadn't called me for several months; she must have been very busy. I realized I hadn't looked for her, even though I really needed her.\n[1975-02-01 10:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that in order to ease my emptiness, my relationship with Mariarosa became closer. I thought that there were still many obstacles between us.\n[1975-02-01 10:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that Franco Mari was already living in her house. I thought that Pietro neither liked my close relationship with his sister nor wanted me to meet my previous boyfriend.\n[1975-02-01 10:15:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought that if I stayed an extra day in Porto, his mood would become extremely bad, he would start trouble for no reason, and our relationship as a couple would become tense.\n[1975-02-01 10:20:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that now Franco Mari never goes out except to see a doctor, and he has to go to the hospital regularly. I thought he probably didn't want me to show up either; he couldn't stand the loud cries of the two children.\n[1975-02-01 10:25:00] Spaccanapoli | I sometimes saw him disappear from the house. I thought about the thing that worried both Mariarosa and me.\n[1975-02-01 10:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I know my sister-in-law has a lot to deal with; she is always surrounded by all sorts of women, and her house has become a base that welcomes everyone: intellectuals, wealthy housewives, women workers fleeing domestic violence, and troubled girls.\n[1975-02-01 10:35:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that she gave me very little time, making it hard for me to establish any kind of connection with her. I thought that even so, spending a few days at her house would reignite my desire to study or write, more accurately, I felt that I still could learn, still could write.\n[1975-02-05 14:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that we often discussed it. I know because we are all women—If Franco Mari hadn't gone out, he would have locked himself in his room as well. I thought about how hard it is for us to understand what a woman really means.\n[1975-02-05 14:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought about every action, thought, word, or dream we had, and when I analyzed them deeply, they seemed not to belong to us at all.\n[1975-02-05 14:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought this kind of in-depth analysis would put women who were more fragile in a crisis, because they couldn't engage in deep reflection. They believed that as long as they removed men, they could walk the path of freedom.\n[1975-02-05 14:15:00] Spaccanapoli | I know it was a very turbulent and unstable time. I thought about how many of us were afraid of returning to that quiet, lifeless state, and how they clung stubbornly to extreme views, filled with fear and anger, standing at the peak of the wave and looking down below.\n[1975-02-05 14:20:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that when everyone found out, the security guards from the \"Continuing Struggle\" headquarters had attacked a feminist march of a separatist group, which made some feminists even more energized. I know that even the strongest-willed women would become extremely heated in their discussions, turning into open hostility, if they found out that Mariarosa was living with a man—an fact she not only didn't mention but actively concealed.\n[1975-02-05 14:25:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that moment I really hated—what I wanted was to find some creative inspiration, not conflict and contradiction. I wanted the possibility of research, not dogma. I thought, or at least that's what I told myself, sometimes I said the same thing to Mariarosa, who would listen quietly to what I had to say.\n[1975-02-05 14:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw it was during that time that I had the opportunity to talk about my relationship with Franco Mari from the Higher Normal School in Borgo and the significance of that relationship to me. I thought to say that I was very grateful to him, that I had learned a lot from him.\n[1975-02-05 14:35:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that he was now cold towards me and my child. I thought about it and felt sorry for it.\n[1975-02-05 14:40:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw it, I thought for a moment, then continued. I heard him say, \"Maybe men's ideas are wrong; they want to educate us. I was very young then and didn't realize that. He didn't like me for who I was; he wanted to change me, to make me someone else. Or to be more precise: he wasn't longing for a woman, but for a dream woman, the kind of woman he himself would have wanted to be if he were female.\"\n[1975-02-05 14:45:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw what I said. I heard her say, \"For Franco Mari, I was his extension, his feminine side, which built his power, showing that he wasn't just capable of being an ideal man, but also an ideal woman. Now, he feels that I am no longer a part of him, and he thinks I've betrayed him.\"\n[1975-02-05 14:50:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that's exactly what I said, and Mariarosa listened to me with great interest. I thought it was a genuine interest from the heart, not the one she pretended to have in front of everyone.\n[1975-02-05 14:55:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her inspiring me to speak. I heard, \"You could write about this aspect.\"\n[1975-02-05 15:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I was moved and, a bit emotional, I said that the Franco Mari I was talking about hadn't had a chance to meet her yet. Finally, she said. \"I heard her say, 'This might be a good thing. I hate men who are too smart; they tell me what I should be. I would never have fallen in love with him back then. I like this man now, full of pain and reflection. I brought him into my home and take care of him.'\"\n[1975-02-05 15:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her say it again at the end. I heard, \"Write down the things you just said.\"\n[1975-02-05 15:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw myself nodding slightly, and she praised me. I thought I was happy, but also a bit embarrassed.\n[1975-02-05 15:15:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw myself saying about my relationship with Pietro, how he imposed his views on me.\n[1975-02-05 15:20:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that, and Mariarosa laughed, breaking our solemn tone, she said. \"I heard 'putting Franco Mari and Pietro together? You're joking. Pietro has a hard time showing his masculinity, let alone forcing his feelings for women onto you.'\"\n[1975-02-05 15:25:00] Vomero | I saw her continue speaking. \"I heard her say, 'Do you want to know something? At that time, I was sure you wouldn't marry him. I was certain that if you did, you'd leave him within a year. I was sure that before you had children with him, you'd think carefully. Now you're still together—I think it's a miracle. You're a good girl, really pitiable.'\"\n[1975-02-05 15:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought about how we'd gotten to this point, and my husband's sister believed our marriage was a mistake, and she had said it outright.\n[1975-02-05 15:35:00] Spaccanapoli | I didn't know whether to cry or laugh, and I thought that was a calm judgment of my very unpleasant marriage.",

    "text": "[1975-02-05 15:40:00] Vomero | What could I do about it? I told myself that maturity meant calmly accepting life's ups and downs, and that I needed to draw a clear line between real life and theory.\n[1975-03-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw time pass day by day, and I gradually calmed down. I thought about my eldest daughter Dede, who had entered first grade early and was already able to read and write; my second daughter Elsa was happy to stay at home in the quiet.\n[1975-03-01 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought of my husband, although he was the most dull and unremarkable man in the university, as if he was finally about to finish his second book, which had raised his status higher than before.\n[1975-03-01 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that I am Elena—Elena Pietro, a submissive but sorrowful woman, yet she also joined the fight, driven by her sister-in-law, resisting oppression. She began to quietly learn how men create women, blending the ancient world with the modern one.\n[1975-03-01 10:15:00] Vomero | I didn't have a specific purpose when I was working on this issue; I just wanted to give an account to Mariarosa, my mother-in-law, and some people I knew: I was doing something.\n[1975-03-01 10:20:00] Vomero | I started reading like that, in a state of deep thought, beginning with the Bible's Old and New Testaments, then moving on to Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, all the way to the latest fashion magazines, Marcel Duchamp, and other materials that reveal issues concerning women.\n[1975-03-05 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought that, slowly, I felt a bit more cheerful. I could now find the mechanical, lifeless women that men had created anywhere.\n[1975-03-05 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought about how we women have nothing of our own, and the little things we come up with soon become their writing material.\n[1975-03-05 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro going to work, Dede at school, and Elsa playing a few steps away from the desk. I thought I finally felt a bit of energy.\n[1975-03-05 10:15:00] Vomero | I think about how I carefully chose my words, and sometimes I imagine, if both I and Lina had taken the middle school entrance exam, if we had both gone to high school and then university, if we had been in perfect harmony, moving forward together hand in hand, what our lives would have been like.\n[1975-03-05 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought we would be perfect partners, blending the power of knowledge, mutual understanding, and the joy of imagination.\n[1975-03-05 10:25:00] Vomero | I thought about how we would write together, signing our names on the same work. We would draw strength from each other, fight side by side, and everything that belonged to us would belong only to us.\n[1975-03-05 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought about the deep loneliness within women, how it is so tormenting. I thought that separating two people was a waste, they have no reference to each other, no support.\n[1975-03-05 10:35:00] Vomero | I thought that in such a situation, it felt as if my mind had been split in two—tempting, but flawed. I desperately wanted affirmation and development, because these thoughts of mine weren't strong or solid enough.\n[1975-03-05 10:40:00] Vomero | I thought about it again and felt like calling her, to say, \"I want to tell you about a question I'm reflecting on. Let's talk about it together. Tell me what you think. Do you remember when you told me about Alfonso Carracci?\"\n[1975-03-05 10:45:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but I've already lost that opportunity forever, and it's been more than ten years. I should have learned to be self-sufficient.\n[1976-03-09 13:00:00] Vomero | I remember that one day, I was thinking about calling Lina. I heard the sound of the key turning in the lock as soon as I saw it.\n[1976-03-09 13:01:00] Vomero | I saw that it was Pietro going home for lunch, as usual, picking up Dede from school and coming back together.\n[1976-03-09 13:02:00] Vomero | I saw myself closing the book and the notebook. I saw Dede rush into the room, and Elsa greeted her happily.\n[1976-03-09 13:03:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, by this point she must be starving, and I knew she would shout at me: \"Mom, what are we having today?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:04:00] Vomero | I saw her, but before I could put down my backpack, she called out. I heard, \"A friend of Dad's is having lunch with us.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:05:00] Vomero | I know I remember that day very clearly: March 9, 1976. I thought about adjusting my mood.\n[1976-03-09 13:06:00] Vomero | I saw Dede grab my hand and pull me into the hallway. As soon as Elsa heard someone else, she cautiously grabbed the hem of my dress.\n[1976-03-09 13:07:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro happily saying. I heard, \"Look who I've brought.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:08:00] Vomero | I saw that Nino no longer had the big beard he had when I met him in the bookstore a few years ago, but his hair was still long and messy.\n[1976-03-09 13:09:00] Vomero | I saw that, apart from that, he was still the same as before, unkempt, tall and thin, with bright eyes.\n[1976-03-09 13:10:00] Vomero | I saw him embrace me, then he crouched down, caressing the two children. Finally, he stood up and said to me, \"I'm sorry, I came too suddenly.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:11:00] Vomero | I saw myself speaking a few hesitant words of greeting to him. \"I heard, 'Come on, please sit down. How did you end up at Mergellina?'\"\n[1976-03-09 13:12:00] Vomero | I thought I must have had too much to drink, my head was spinning, I couldn't believe what was happening: he, truly him, was appearing in my home.\n[1976-03-09 13:13:00] Vomero | I thought about it, and I felt my mind was in a mess, my whole body unsettled and disoriented, unable to deal with what was happening. What had I imagined just now? What was actually happening? Who was the illusion, and who was real?\n[1976-03-09 13:14:00] Vomero | I saw this, and Pietro explained to me. I heard, \"We met in the department, and I invited him to lunch.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:15:00] Vomero | I saw myself smiling and said. I heard, \"Okay, everything's ready. Just add another set of utensils. You all stay with me while I set the table for everyone.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:16:00] Vomero | I saw myself desperately pretending to smile, and my face hurt. I thought about how I appeared calm on the surface, but in reality, I was extremely excited. Why was Nino here? What on earth was going on?\n[1976-03-09 13:17:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro speaking to me cautiously. I heard, \"I want to give you a surprise.\" I thought it was because he was worried that he had done something wrong.\n[1976-03-09 13:18:00] Vomero | I saw that, and Nino was smiling. I heard, \"I swear, I told him many times to call you, but he didn't want to.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:19:00] Vomero | I saw and then he explained that it was my father-in-law who had asked him to get in touch with us. I know he met Professor Pietro at Rome during a meeting of Socialist Party. As they were talking, Nino said he was coming to Mergellina on business.\n[1976-03-09 13:20:00] Vomero | I saw Professor Pietro, who mentioned Pietro, and the new book Pietro was writing, as well as a book he had just obtained that he was bringing to Pietro. I knew that Nino had volunteered to bring the book himself, and then he came over for dinner.\n[1976-03-09 13:30:00] Vomero | I saw that both of our daughters wanted to get his attention, they were competing with each other, and he played with them, not leaving either one out.\n[1976-03-09 13:35:00] Vomero | I saw him speaking to Pietro very gently, but he said hardly anything to me, and his tone was very serious.\n[1976-03-09 13:40:00] Vomero | I saw him say it to me. \"I heard, 'You know, I've come to this city on business many times, but I didn't know you lived here. You already have two beautiful daughters. It's a good opportunity that we met.'\"\n[1976-03-09 13:41:00] Vomero | I saw it, yet I still asked. \"I heard 'Are you still teaching at Porto?'\" I thought that although I knew, he was no longer living in Porto.\n[1976-03-09 13:41:10] Vomero | I heard, \"No, I'm teaching at San Gregorio Armeno now.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:41:20] Vomero | I heard, \"What do you teach?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:41:30] Vomero | I saw him make a very unhappy expression. I heard \"geography.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:41:40] Vomero | I heard, \"That is to say?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:41:50] Vomero | I heard \"Urban Geography.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:42:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Why did you decide to go back?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:42:10] Vomero | I heard, \"My mother is not in good health.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:42:20] Vomero | I heard, \"That's a pity, what happened to her?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:42:30] Vomero | I heard \"heart condition.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:42:40] Vomero | I heard, \"How are your younger brother and sister?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:42:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Everything is fine.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:43:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Where is your father?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:43:10] Vomero | I heard him say, \"It's still the same as always. Time can change everything; a person grows up. In recent times, our relationship has eased. My father is like everyone else—he has his flaws and his virtues.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:44:00] Vomero | I saw, then I said to Pietro. I heard, \"How much trouble did we cause in order to oppose our father and family? Now we have become fathers ourselves. Can we handle it?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:44:10] Vomero | I saw my husband say with a touch of mockery. I heard, \"I'm okay.\"\n[1976-03-09 13:45:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'There's no doubt you've married an extraordinary woman. These two little princesses are perfect, well-mannered, and elegant. Dede, what a beautiful dress you're wearing, it suits you so well. And Elsa, who gave you that hair clip with little stars?\"\n[1976-03-09 13:45:10] Vomero | I saw Elsa say. I heard \"Mom.\"\n[1976-03-09 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself gradually calming down, slowly getting used to what was happening, and time resumed its previous rhythm.\n[1976-03-09 14:05:00] Vomero | I saw Nino sitting beside me, eating the noodles I had made. He carefully cut the ribs into small pieces for Elsa and then ate the meat in his own plate with great enjoyment.\n[1976-03-09 14:10:00] Vomero | I saw him speaking in a scornful tone about the bribe that Rockshelter had given to Tanas and Guey, and he said. I heard, \"You cook very well.\"\n[1976-03-09 14:15:00] Vomero | I saw him talking to Pietro about the future of Socialist Party. He peeled an apple, and the peel remained unbroken the whole time, which fascinated Dede.\n[1976-03-09 14:20:00] Vomero | At that moment, the entire house was filled with a warm and harmonious atmosphere. I thought it was an atmosphere I hadn't felt in a long time.\n[1976-03-09 14:25:00] Vomero | It's such a wonderful thing when two men recognize and appreciate each other.\n[1976-03-09 14:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself quietly clearing the table, and Nino stood up too, wanting to help wash the dishes. He also asked the two children to lend him a hand.\n[1976-03-09 14:31:00] Vomero | I saw him saying it to me. I heard, \"Sit down.\"\n[1976-03-09 14:35:00] Vomero | I saw myself sitting down, and he, along with passionate Dede and Elsa, started washing the dishes. He continued chatting with Pietro, and from time to time asked me where things should go.\n[1976-03-09 14:40:00] Vomero | I thought it was really him, after so much time, he appeared in my home.\n[1976-03-09 14:45:00] Vomero | I saw myself looking involuntarily at the ring on his ring finger. I thought to myself, he never mentioned his marriage. He talked about his mother, his father, but never once mentioned his wife or son.\n[1976-03-09 14:50:00] Vomero | I thought that maybe it wasn't a marriage born of love, maybe he married for profit, maybe he was forced to marry.\n[1976-03-09 14:55:00] Vomero | When I got to the end, all my wild thoughts disappeared. Nino suddenly started talking to my two daughters about his son, whose name was Albert. I thought about the way he spoke about his son, as if the child were a character from a fairy tale. His tone alternated between comic and tender.\n[1976-03-09 15:00:00] Vomero | I watched until he dried his hands and took out a photo from his wallet. He showed it first to Elsa, then to Dede and Pietro. Finally, Pietro passed the photo to me.\n[1976-03-09 15:05:00] Vomero | I saw that Albert was two years old, very handsome. In the photo, his mother was holding him, and he had a serious expression on his face.\n[1976-03-09 15:06:00] Vomero | I looked at the child for a few seconds, then immediately started examining the mother. I found her striking—she had big eyes and long black hair. She was probably in her early twenties.\n[1976-03-09 15:07:00] Vomero | I saw her smiling, her straight, dazzling teeth shining, her eyes full of love.\n[1976-03-09 15:08:00] Vomero | I saw myself returning the photo to him, and I said. I heard, \"I'll make the coffee.\"\n[1976-03-09 15:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself alone in the kitchen, while the other four had gone to the living room.\n[1976-03-09 15:30:00] Vomero | I saw that Nino had something else to do. After finishing his coffee and smoking a cigarette, he apologized to us and said he had to leave.\n[1976-03-09 15:31:00] Vomero | I saw him say it. I heard, \"I'm leaving tomorrow, but I'll be back soon, back next week.\"\n[1976-03-09 15:32:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro inviting him to have dinner at his house, and he had said it several times; he agreed.\n[1976-03-09 15:33:00] Vomero | I saw him warmly say goodbye to my two daughters, shake hands with Pietro, and greet me before leaving.\n[1976-03-09 15:35:00] Vomero | I saw the door close just behind him, and I felt the whole house sink back into darkness.\n[1976-03-09 15:40:00] Vomero | I thought that although Pietro was at ease in front of Nino, I was waiting for him to say something bad about Nino, which was his usual habit after guests left.\n[1976-03-09 15:45:00] Vomero | I saw it, but he said happily. I heard, \"Finally, I've met someone worth having a conversation with.\"\n[1976-03-09 15:50:00] Vomero | I couldn't understand why, but what he said hurt me deeply.\n[1976-03-09 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself turning on the television and spending the entire afternoon sitting in front of it with the two children.\n[1976-03-10 09:00:00] Vomero | I thought about the next day, and I began to long for Nino to call. Every time the phone rang, it made me jump.",

I thought about how I felt like I had a severe cold, becoming very lazy, and I was angry at myself for that meaningless waiting.\n[1976-03-17 17:00:00] Vomero | I remember one afternoon when Pietro came home in a particularly good mood, he said. I heard, \"Nino came to the department to see me, and we talked for a while.\"\n[1976-03-17 17:05:00] Vomero | I saw that he hadn't managed to convince Nino to come home. Nino didn't want me to go to the trouble of cooking, so he invited us out to eat tomorrow night, telling us to bring the children.\n[1976-03-17 17:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself suddenly becoming very attentive to Pietro. I thought about how I felt my blood rushing faster.\n[1976-03-17 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw the two children enter their room, and I immediately embraced him, [intimate action], and told him many loving words.\n[1976-03-18 02:00:00] Vomero | I thought about how I didn't sleep much that night, or to put it more accurately, I felt like I was constantly awake.\n[1976-03-18 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw that the next day, when Dede had just come back from school, I put her and Elsa into the bathtub and gave them both a good bath.\n[1976-03-18 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw and then I started getting myself together. I took a comfortable shower, shaved all the hair off my body, and carefully dried myself off.\n[1976-03-18 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself trying on all the clothes, but I became increasingly uneasy. I thought about how, because I don't like the way I look, I'm also dissatisfied with my hair.\n[1976-03-18 18:30:00] Vomero | I saw Dede and Elsa surrounding me, imitating me. They stood in front of the mirror, pretending to be dissatisfied with their clothes and hair, their little feet tapping against my shoes.\n[1976-03-18 19:00:00] Vomero | I saw Elsa dirtied her dress before leaving, and I scolded her harshly. I thought about it until I could only accept myself as I was.\n[1976-03-18 19:15:00] Mercato | I saw myself driving to the university to pick up Pietro and Nino, who had already arranged to meet there. I thought about how anxious I had been the entire time, constantly talking about the two children, who kept singing a lullaby they had made up themselves, with lyrics all about pee and poop.\n[1976-03-18 19:30:00] University of Mergellina | The closer I got to the agreed-upon place, the more I hoped that Nino would have something come up at the last minute and not be able to come. But from afar, I already saw the two of them standing at the spot, talking.\n[1976-03-18 19:31:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_002 | I thought about Nino's gestures, which were so infectious, as if he wanted the person he was talking to to enter a world that had been set up just for him.\n[1976-03-18 19:32:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_002 | I saw only he was laughing. I thought to myself that Pietro was, as usual, clumsy, his skin slightly flushed, and he seemed somewhat out of place in front of Nino.\n[1976-03-18 19:33:00] UNIVERSITY_LOC_002 | I saw that neither of them showed any particular reaction to my arrival.\n[1976-03-18 19:40:00] In Pietro's car | I saw my husband and two children sitting in the back, and Nino was sitting next to me, pointing the way to a good restaurant.\n[1976-03-18 19:45:00] In Pietro's car | I saw him turn around and say to Dede and Elsa that the fried dough was delicious. He explained the taste of the fried dough very carefully, and the two children listened with great enthusiasm.\n[1976-03-18 19:46:00] In Pietro's car | I saw him with the corner of my eye. I thought back to many years ago, when we walked hand in hand, and he [intimate act] me. His fingers were so beautiful.\n[1976-03-18 19:47:00] In Pietro's car | I saw it, but now he only says it to me. I heard, \"Go to the right, then turn right again, and at the crossroads turn left.\" I thought about how he had never said a single flattering word to me, never given me an appreciative look.\n[1976-03-18 20:00:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I saw that in the restaurant, we were warmly and respectfully welcomed. I know that Nino knows the owner and the waiters at the restaurant.\n[1976-03-18 20:05:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I reached the end, and I sat at the head of the table, between the two children, with the two men sitting face to face.\n[1976-03-18 20:10:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw that my husband was talking about his university days, which had become increasingly difficult. I hadn't said a word all along; I was taking care of Dede and Elsa.\n[1976-03-18 20:15:00] Posillipo | I saw them arguing and laughing, trying to attract Nino's attention. I know that usually they are well-behaved at the table.\n[1976-03-18 20:20:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I thought uncomfortably that Pietro talked too much, not giving Nino a chance to speak, which would surely annoy him.\n[1976-03-18 20:25:00] Posillipo | I thought, we've been living in this city for seven years, and yet we never have a regular restaurant—those places where the food is good, where the waiters recognize us as soon as we walk in, a place where we can take our friends to eat.\n[1976-03-18 20:30:00] Posillipo | I saw that I liked my boss's politeness; he often came to our table to greet us, and finally, he even said something to Nino. I heard, \"Tonight, I don't recommend this dish for you and your guests; it's not suitable. I suggest you order something else.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:35:00] Restaurant Mergellina | When the fried bread that Nino had spoken of arrived, the two children cheered, and Pietro did too; they all rushed to eat it.\n[1976-03-18 20:40:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw that only at this moment, Nino spoke to me. I heard, \"Why haven't I seen you write anything since then?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:41:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I thought about his tone, which was serious and lacked the usual lightness of conversation at the dinner table. I felt that he was genuinely interested in knowing about me.\n[1976-03-18 20:42:00] Posillipo | I saw my face turn red all of a sudden, and I pointed at the two children. I heard, \"I did something else.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:42:10] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"Your previous book was great.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:42:20] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I heard \"Thank you.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:42:30] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I heard, \"This isn't flattery, your writing has always been good. Do you remember that short article you wrote about the religious teacher?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:42:40] Posillipo | I heard, \"Your friend's work was never published later on.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:42:50] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"There was a little problem with the delivery.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:43:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"I lost my confidence at that moment.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:43:10] Posillipo | I heard, \"I'm sorry. Are you writing something?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:43:20] Posillipo | I heard, \"Write something when you have time.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:43:30] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"Are you writing a long novel?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:43:40] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"I don't know what it is?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:43:50] Posillipo | I heard \"What is the theme?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:44:00] Posillipo | I heard \"a man who fabricates women.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:44:10] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"Very good.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:44:20] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"You'll see.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:44:30] Restaurant Mergellina | I heard, \"You must try your best! I want to see your work as soon as possible.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:45:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | What surprised me was that he was very familiar with the feminist books I studied, and at that time I was sure that men wouldn't read those books.\n[1976-03-18 20:46:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I saw that it wasn't just that—he also mentioned the Starobinsky I had been reading at that time, and he said I might need something from his book.\n[1976-03-18 20:47:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I thought he really knew everything, he's always been like that, full of curiosity about every question.\n[1976-03-18 20:48:00] Posillipo | I saw that he was now mentioning Rousseau and Schopenhauer, so I interrupted him. He listened to me very attentively.\n[1976-03-18 20:50:00] Posillipo | I saw Nino make a gesture to the boss to add some more. At this moment, what worried me was that the two children were shouting they still wanted fried dough.\n[1976-03-18 20:51:00] Posillipo | I saw, then I said to Pietro. I heard, \"You should give your wife more time.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:51:10] Posillipo | I heard, \"She has all day long.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:51:20] Posillipo | I heard her say, \"I'm not joking with you. If you don't give your wife time, you're a sinner—not just as a person, but politically as well.\"",

If women devote themselves only to raising children and managing the household, it stifles their intellect. Society is doing something harmful to itself, but is completely unaware of it.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:52:00] Posillipo | I saw myself silently waiting for Pietro to answer, and my husband spoke in a teasing tone. I heard, \"Elena can use her intelligence any way she wants, as long as she doesn't take up my time.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:52:10] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I heard, \"If I don't take up your time, whose time should I take up?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:53:00] Posillipo | I saw Pietro frown, he said. I heard, \"There's nothing that can stop us from completing our mission when we're in a hurry and full of enthusiasm for our work.\"\n[1976-03-18 20:54:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw myself forcing a smile. I heard, \"My husband said that I don't have any real interests.\" I thought I felt hurt.\n[1976-03-18 20:55:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw a silence, Nino asked. I heard, \"Is that right?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:56:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I saw myself saying casually that I didn't know, that I knew nothing at all. I realized that when I spoke those words, filled with embarrassment and anger, my eyes were full of tears, and I lowered my head.\n[1976-03-18 20:57:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I saw myself speaking to the two children in a voice that sounded somewhat out of control. I heard, \"Stop eating!\"\n[1976-03-18 20:58:00] Restaurant Mergellina | At that moment, Nino also helped me, he shouted loudly. I heard, \"I'll have one more and then stop. Mom isn't eating anymore, Dad has stopped too. The two of you, isn't that enough?\"\n[1976-03-18 20:59:00] Posillipo | I saw that, and he called the boss over, saying very solemnly. I heard, \"In a month, thirty days exactly, I'll come here with these two ladies. You have to prepare a lot of good fried dough, a whole bunch of it, okay?\"\n[1976-03-18 21:00:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw Elsa ask. I heard, \"When is a month, when is thirty days?\"\n[1976-03-18 21:01:00] Posillipo | I saw that, and I forced back my tears, staring at Nino. I heard, \"Yes, when is a month, when is thirty days?\"\n[1976-03-18 21:02:00] Posillipo | I saw Dede and the rest of us adults teasing Elsa. I know because she hasn't developed a sense of time yet.\n[1976-03-18 21:10:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I watched until the end. Pietro went to pay, but found that Nino had already paid. He protested a bit, then sat down at the steering wheel and drove. I sat in the back with the two drowsy children.\n[1976-03-18 21:20:00] In Pietro's car | I watched as they took Nino back to the hotel, and all the way there I listened to their slightly drunk talk, saying nothing.\n[1976-03-18 21:25:00] At the entrance of the hotel | I saw that we had arrived, and Pietro was full of enthusiasm, speaking veryenthusiasticly. I heard, \"You don't need to waste money. We have a spare room at home. The next time you come, you can stay with us. Don't be shy.\"\n[1976-03-18 21:25:10] At the Gate of Mask Loc 002 Hotel | I saw Nino smile, he said. I heard, \"Less than an hour ago, we said Elena needed her own time, and now you want me to add to her burden?\"\n[1976-03-18 21:25:20] At the entrance of the hotel | I saw myself saying in a weak voice. \"I'm happy if you come, Dede and Elsa will be happy too.\"\n[1976-03-18 21:30:00] In Pietro's car | After the farewell, I immediately said to my husband. I heard, \"Before making such an invitation, you should at least ask me.\"\n[1976-03-18 21:30:10] In Pietro's car | I saw him starting the car, searching for my gaze in the rearview mirror, and muttered something. I heard, \"I thought you'd be happy.\"\n[1976-03-18 21:31:00] In Pietro's car | I thought, of course I'm happy, I'm absolutely thrilled, but I feel as if my body is as fragile as an eggshell. If someone just lightly presses on my arm, my forehead, or my stomach, my body would break apart, and all my secrets would spill out. Those things were also secrets to me.\n[1976-03-19 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself focused on reading my book. I thought about how I had avoided counting the days, and I did this as if Nino had told me to do so. When he reappeared, I wanted to give him a more satisfactory answer.\n[1976-04-18 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought this was a good idea, and before I even realized it, the thirty-day waiting period passed quickly.\n[1976-04-18 10:05:00] Vomero | I had forgotten Elena, I had never thought of Lina, I never called Mariarosa, I didn't read the newspaper or watch television, I completely ignored the two children and the home. I thought about how I had ignored the entire Italy, and the events that kept breaking out across this planet: arrests, conflicts, murders, and wars. I only vaguely understood that during that time, Italy was filled with tense campaign slogans.\n[1976-04-18 10:10:00] Vomero | I had spent a long time thinking hard, writing about a pile of old questions, until later, I felt I had found a solution, at least in words.\n[1976-04-18 10:15:00] Vomero | Sometimes I tried to talk to Pietro about what I was writing. I thought he was more thoughtful than I had considered. He would surely have made me avoid writing something rash or foolish, but I didn't talk to him about these things. He would use his all-knowingness to highlight my ignorance, making me feel uncomfortable. I didn't like those moments.\n[1976-04-18 10:20:00] Vomero | I remember what I saw, and I was very diligent, especially with the Bible. I spent a lot of time on it, arranging the materials in order. I thought to myself that the first step was a summary of God's creation of all things, and the second step was to elaborate on it.\n[1976-04-18 10:30:00] Vomero | I kept writing like that day by day, my mind and thoughts always in an excited state. I thought my only motivation was to come up with something readable in time.\n[1976-04-19 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw him, but a month passed and he never showed up.\n[1976-04-20 10:00:00] Vomero | I later began to worry, so I asked Pietro about it. I found out that they often called each other in the office, but there had been no word from him these past few days.\n[1976-04-20 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw something that annoyed me, so I asked. I heard, \"You two call each other often?\"\n[1976-04-20 10:05:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1976-04-20 10:05:20] NEW HOME | I heard, \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n[1976-04-20 10:05:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Can I tell you?\"\n[1976-04-20 10:05:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Tell me, do you two talk often.\"\n[1976-04-20 10:05:50] Vomero | I heard, \"We were only talking about work matters.\"\n[1976-04-20 10:06:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Well, it seems you're already good friends now. Why don't you call him and ask when he's coming?\"\n[1976-04-20 10:06:10] Vomero | I heard \"Is that necessary?\"\n[1976-04-20 10:06:20] Vomero | \"I don't need to worry about it, but I will. I'll make the arrangements, and I'd like to know in advance.\"\n[1976-04-27 18:00:00] Vomero | I didn't get his call for a week; it came one evening, and I answered it myself. He seemed a bit embarrassed. He made some small talk, then asked. I heard, \"Is Pietro not home?\"\n[1976-04-27 18:05:00] Vomero | I realized this time it was my turn to feel embarrassed, so I asked my husband to take the call. I thought they talked for a long time. I heard him speaking in a rare tone—his voice was loud, full of exclamations, and mixed with laughter, which made my mood worse and worse.\n[1976-04-27 18:10:00] Vomero | I realized then that only in this way did his relationship with Nino provide him with a sense of security, making him feel less isolated and helping him forget about the problems at school, so he could regain his strength and continue his work.\n[1976-04-27 18:15:00] Vomero | I saw myself locked in my room, Dede reading a book, Elsa playing, both of them waiting for dinner. I could see her, but even inside the room, I could still hear my husband's voice, as if he were drunk.\n[1976-04-27 18:20:00] Vomero | I saw him fall silent in the end. I heard him moving around in the house. He finally showed his face, and he said happily to his two daughters. I heard, \"Children, tomorrow night, we're going to have a meal with Uncle Nino.\"\n[1976-04-27 18:21:00] Vomero | I saw Dede and Elsa enthusiastically cheering, I asked. I heard, \"He's not coming to live here?\"\n[1976-04-27 18:21:10] Vomero | I saw him answer me. I heard, \"No, he came with his wife and son. They're staying at the hotel.\"\n[1976-04-27 18:22:00] Vomero | I saw that I had taken a long time to digest those words, and I couldn't help but say. \"I heard, 'He should have called ahead.'\"\n[1976-04-27 18:22:10] Vomero | I heard, \"They also made the decision at the last minute.\"\n[1976-04-27 18:22:20] Vomero | I heard, \"That's really rude.\"\n[1976-04-27 18:22:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Elena, is there a problem?\"\n[1976-04-27 18:30:00] Vomero | I thought that, so Nino had come with his wife, and I was very worried, afraid that I would seem inadequate in comparison.\n[1976-04-27 18:35:00] Vomero | I think that sometimes—not usually, but when I dress myself up for a man—\"grooming\" myself makes me feel ridiculous. All the time I spend on careful makeup and styling my eyebrows could have been used for something else.\n[1976-04-27 18:40:00] Vomero | I thought about how I feared I might fail at the last moment, looking unattractive, unable to hide the vulgarity of my body, unable to conceal my emotions, my breath, my transformations. In any case, I've done it, for Nino, and recently I've done it again.\n[1976-04-27 18:45:00] Vomero | I thought, that's enough! He brought his wife, and I was furious, I felt he did it on purpose.\n[1976-04-27 18:50:00] Vomero | The moment I thought about the possibility of me appearing at the same time as that beautiful woman in the photo, I felt sick to my stomach. After dinner, when I was alone with her husband, she would criticize me with sharp and cruel words.\n[1976-04-27 20:00:00] Vomero | I had hesitated for hours, and finally I decided I should make an excuse not to have dinner with them, letting my husband take the two children by himself.\n[1976-04-28 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw her, but the next day, I couldn't resist the temptation. I put on my clothes, took them off, put them back on again, and kept messing around with Pietro.\n[1976-04-28 17:10:00] Vomero | I kept going to his room, sometimes wearing one dress, then another; sometimes with one hairstyle, then another, and seriously asking him. I heard, \"What do you think I look like?\"\n[1976-04-28 17:10:10] Vomero | I saw him glance at me carelessly and say. I heard \"Very good.\"\n[1976-04-28 17:10:20] Vomero | I saw myself saying the answer. I heard, \"How do I look in that blue dress?\"\n[1976-04-28 17:10:30] Vomero | I saw him nod. I thought about it, but I don't like that blue dress—it's too tight at the waist.\n[1976-04-28 17:15:00] Vomero | I saw myself wearing the blue dress, returning to him, and saying to him. I heard, \"It's too tight to wear.\"\n[1976-04-28 17:15:10] Vomero | I saw Pietro speaking patiently. I heard, \"Yes, the green one with flowers is better.\"\n[1976-04-28 17:20:00] Vomero | I thought, in the end, Pietro couldn't give me any confidence because he ignored me. The more I thought about it, the worse I felt about myself—I had big breasts and a big butt, my hips were too wide, my hair was yellow and lifeless, and my nose was too big.\n[1976-04-28 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw it, but in the end I went anyway. I wore a white blouse and a bright floral skirt, my only jewelry was the bracelet my mother had given me. I thought about how I had put my writings in my bag, and I told myself that I didn't care what she, him, or anyone else thought.",

    "text": "[1976-04-28 20:00:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I realized I'd been dawdling all along, and in the end we were late. When we arrived at the restaurant, the Nino family was already seated at the table.\n[1976-04-28 20:05:00] Mask Loc 002 Restaurant | I saw Nino introduce his wife, Elena.\n[1976-04-28 20:06:00] Restaurant Mergellina | Her cheeks were beautiful, her jet-black hair was also beautiful, exactly like in the photo, but she wasn't as tall as me, and she didn't have a chest, although she was also rather plump. I thought my mood would change right away.\n[1976-04-28 20:07:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw her wearing a bright red dress. She was especially happy, and as soon as she opened her mouth, her sharp voice and strong San Gregorio Armeno accent became obvious. I thought that the dress didn't suit her at all.\n[1976-04-28 20:15:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw her start attacking Mergellina, the restaurant where we ate, the owner, anything Pietro had said, and my two daughters, naturally including me. I thought, especially throughout the whole evening, she had acted very naively.\n[1976-04-28 20:30:00] Posillipo | I watched her constantly praising her husband—nobody was better than him, she agreed with everything he said, and would caress and embrace him, [intimate gestures] him. I wondered what this girl before me had in common with Lina, or even with Sylvia? They had nothing in common. Why then had Nino married her?\n[1976-04-28 20:45:00] Posillipo | I watched him all night long. I thought about how he was very polite to his wife, letting her embrace him affectionately, and when she said those uneducated and foolish things, he would smile at her and casually play with their son. But his attitude toward my two daughters didn't change; he was very attentive to them.\n[1976-04-28 21:00:00] Posillipo | I thought to myself that his wife would never have any effect on him. Elena was just a stepping stone in his turbulent life, but she wouldn't affect him at all. Nino would follow his own path, without caring about her.\n[1976-04-28 21:10:00] Posillipo | I saw, especially when he recognized my bracelet, he grabbed my wrist for a few seconds, almost like he was touching me; he joked with my husband, asking if he had given me some time; especially, he asked how my writing was going. I found that, therefore, I felt increasingly at ease.\n[1976-04-28 21:11:00] Posillipo | I saw what I said. I heard, \"I've finished the first part.\"\n[1976-04-28 21:12:00] Posillipo | I saw Nino asking Pietro seriously. I heard, \"Did you see it?\"\n[1976-04-28 21:12:10] Posillipo | I heard, \"Elena doesn't let me see anything.\"\n[1976-04-28 21:12:20] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw myself retorting, but without any resentment, as if it were a game between us. I heard, \"It's because you don't want to see it.\"\n[1976-04-28 21:15:00] Posillipo | I saw Elena speak up at this moment; she didn't want to be left out of the conversation, so she asked. I heard, \"What thing?\"\n[1976-04-28 21:15:10] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw her, but just as I was about to answer her, she suddenly thought of something else and eagerly asked me. I heard, \"Can you go shopping with me tomorrow when Nino is working?\"\n[1976-04-28 21:16:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw myself pretending to be polite, smiling and saying, \"Sure, that's fine.\"\n[1976-04-28 21:30:00] Restaurant Door | I only had the chance to go up to Nino when we left the restaurant, and I whispered to him. I heard, \"Do you want to take a look at what I've written?\"\n[1976-04-28 21:30:10] Restaurant Door | I saw him looking at me with genuine surprise. I heard, \"You really want me to look?\"\n[1976-04-28 21:30:20] Restaurant Door | I said what I saw. I heard, \"Yes, if you're not bored.\"\n[1976-04-28 21:31:00] Restaurant Door | I saw myself hastily handing him the things I had written, my heart pounding like a drum. I thought as if I didn't want Pietro, Elena, and my two daughters to find out.\n[1976-04-29 09:00:00] Vomero | I hadn't closed my eyes all night, but in the morning I forced myself to go meet Elena, as we had agreed to meet at the hotel entrance at ten o'clock.\n[1976-04-29 09:05:00] Vomero | I was about to go out at nine o'clock when the phone rang. It was him.\n[1976-04-29 09:06:00] Vomero | I saw him say it. I heard, \"I'm sorry, I'm about to go into the library now. I won't have a chance to call you before tonight. Are you sure I didn't disturb you?\"\n[1976-04-29 09:06:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Absolutely not.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:06:20] Vomero | \"I heard 'I read what you wrote.'\"\n[1976-04-29 09:06:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Ah, so quickly?\"\n[1976-04-29 09:06:40] Vomero | \"I heard, 'Yes, it's written so well. Your research skills are strong, your arguments are clear, and your creativity really impressed me. But what I'm most jealous of is your storytelling ability. You wrote something hard to categorize—I don't know if it's an essay or a novel. I think it's great.'\"\n[1976-04-29 09:06:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Is that a weakness?\"\n[1976-04-29 09:07:00] Vomero | \"I heard 'What?'\"\n[1976-04-29 09:07:10] Vomero | I heard, \"The things I write can't be categorized.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:07:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Not at all, that's one of its advantages.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:07:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Do you think I should just publish it like that?\"\n[1976-04-29 09:07:40] Vomero | I heard, \"It's absolutely necessary.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:07:50] Vomero | I heard \"Thank you.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:08:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'Thank you. Now I have to go. Be patient with Elena, she seems domineering, but actually it's because of shyness. We'll return to San Gregorio Armeno tomorrow morning. After the election, I'll contact you. If you're willing, we can talk.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:08:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Of course I'd be happy to. Are you coming to stay at my house?\"\n[1976-04-29 09:08:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Are you sure I won't disturb you?\"\n[1976-04-29 09:08:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Absolutely not.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:08:40] Vomero | \"I heard 'Okay.'\"\n[1976-04-29 09:09:00] Vomero | I saw that he hadn't hung up, and I heard his breathing.\n[1976-04-29 09:09:10] Vomero | I heard \"Elena.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:09:20] Vomero | I heard \"Hmm.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:09:30] Vomero | I heard, \"About Lina, we were all wrong from the beginning.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:09:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Why do you say that?\" I thought I felt very uncomfortable.\n[1976-04-29 09:09:50] Vomero | I heard, \"You've attributed your own special abilities to her.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:10:00] Vomero | \"I heard 'What about you?'\"\n[1976-04-29 09:10:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I'm worse, I foolishly thought what I saw in you was what I saw in her.\"\n[1976-04-29 09:10:30] Vomero | I thought for a few seconds, saying nothing. Why did he mention Lina? Why would he say such things over the phone?\n[1976-04-29 09:10:40] Vomero | I thought he wanted to tell me that ever since childhood, he'd liked me, but on Ischia, he'd made a mistake, attributing the qualities that belonged to me to someone else.\n[1976-04-29 09:11:00] Vomero | I saw what I said. I heard, \"Hurry up and come.\"\n[1976-04-29 12:00:00] Mercato | I saw myself with Elena and the three children shopping together. I felt very comfortable in my heart, and even if she were to stab me with a knife, I probably wouldn't feel any pain.\n[1976-04-29 12:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that Nino's wife, seeing how happy I was and how warm I was toward her, no longer had hostility toward me.\n[1976-04-29 12:35:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her praising Dede and Elsa, saying they were so well-behaved. She confessed to me that she admired me. I heard myself say, \"I'm a little jealous of you, not because you're so capable, but because you've always known him, and I haven't.\"\n[1976-04-29 12:40:00] Spaccanapoli | I heard her say, \"I wish I had met him when he was a child, then I would have known what he looked like at ten, what he looked like at fourteen, what his voice was like before his voice changed, how he used to laugh as a child. Fortunately, I have Albert now, who looks exactly like his father.\"\n[1976-04-29 12:45:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw myself looking at the child. I thought about it, but I didn't see Nino's shadow. Maybe he'll show up later.\n[1976-04-29 12:46:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw Dede immediately say with great pride. I heard, \"I am like my father.\"\n[1976-04-29 12:47:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw Elsa continue. I heard, \"I'm more like Mom.\"\n[1976-04-29 12:50:00] Spaccanapoli | When I thought about it, I remembered Sylvia's son Mirko, who was really the same as Nino.\n[1976-04-29 12:55:00] Spaccanapoli | I thought to myself that Nino surely couldn't have thought of Mirko; as far as I know, he had never shown any interest in Gennaro either.\n[1976-04-29 13:00:00] Spaccanapoli\n[1976-04-29 13:05:00] Spaccanapoli | I was thinking about these things when I told Elena that her son was exactly like his father when he was a boy. I felt happy about the lie I had told myself.\n[1976-04-29 13:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I told her, in a warm and gentle tone, about Nino's appearance in elementary school, and then in high school, mentioned Teacher Galiani, and the time we spent on vacation together in Ischia with other friends.\n[1976-04-29 14:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that as we talked, she became increasingly friendly toward me and more and more trusting of me.\n[1976-04-29 14:10:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw us enter a store. If I tried on a piece of clothing I liked but didn't buy, I would find that Elena had already bought it and given it to me when we left.\n[1976-04-29 14:20:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw her wanting to buy clothes for Dede and Elsa, and when we ate in the restaurant, it was her who paid.",

    "text": "[1976-04-29 15:00:00] Mercato | I saw her hire a taxi, telling the driver to take me and my two daughters home first, and then take herself and her son back to the hotel. She was carrying many bags.\n[1976-04-29 15:10:00] Vomero | I watched us say goodbye, and my two daughters and I kept waving until the car disappeared around the corner.\n[1976-04-29 15:15:00] Vomero | I thought, she represented the other side of San Gregorio Armeno, but it was far from my own experience.\n[1976-04-29 15:20:00] Vomero | I thought about how she spent money like water, as if the money had no value at all. Those certainly weren't Nino's earnings, and I ruled out that possibility.\n[1976-04-29 15:30:00] Vomero | I thought about it, wondering what difference there was between the wealth of the bourgeoisie and the Solara family's wealth. How many secret transactions had those money gone through before becoming the lawyer's high salary and luxurious life.\n[1976-04-29 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw that afternoon, and both my daughters and I were showing off the gifts we had received in front of the mirror. I thought of a dark red, 1940s-style dress that would suit me perfectly, and I wanted Nino to see me in it.\n[1976-04-30 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw him, but Nino's family had already returned to San Gregorio Armeno, and before leaving, we didn't get a chance to meet again. I thought it would be hard, but time actually passed quite pleasantly.\n[1976-05-01 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that to avoid unnecessary arguments, I placed a copy of my own work on Pietro's desk as well.\n[1976-05-01 10:10:00] Vomero | I called Mariarosa and, with a confident and cheerful tone, told her that I had put together the things we had discussed earlier. I thought to myself that I was sure I had written it well.\n[1976-05-01 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw her and she told me to send it to her right away.\n[1976-05-05 10:00:00] Vomero | A few days later, she called me. She was very enthusiastic and asked if she could translate the things I'd written into French and send them to a friend in Nanterre. This French friend owned a small publishing house.\n[1976-05-05 10:05:00] Vomero | I said I was happy to accept, but the matter didn't end there.\n[1976-05-05 12:00:00] Vomero | I saw it was exactly the day I had sent off the manuscript. In the middle of the day, Nino unexpectedly called me from the train station, saying he had already arrived at Mergellina.\n[1976-05-05 12:05:00] Vomero | I heard, \"I'll be there in half an hour. I'll put my luggage down first, then go to the library.\"\n[1976-05-05 12:06:00] Vomero | I saw myself pretending to be natural as I asked him. I heard, \"Aren't you going to eat something?\"\n[1976-05-05 12:30:00] Vomero | I thought that after such a long journey, we had come to this point, him coming to live in my house, and I felt it was perfectly normal.\n[1976-05-05 13:00:00] Vomero | I made him something to eat while he was taking a shower, and then we had dinner together — me, him, and my two daughters. I know that at this moment, Pietro is giving exams to his students at the university.\n[1976-05-05 14:00:00] Vomero | I didn't realize it until several hours later, when my mother-in-law called me, pretending to be angry. \"I heard, 'Now you write things that Mariarosa reads, but you don't show them to me anymore. What's going on?'\"\n[1976-05-05 14:05:00] Vomero | I said what I saw. \"I was worried you wouldn't be interested in these things, so I wrote seventy pages, not a novel, even I don't know what it is myself.\"\n[1976-05-05 14:06:00] Vomero | I heard, \"When you don't know what you've written, that means you've done it well. Anyway, you have to let me decide whether I'm interested or not.\"\n[1976-05-05 14:10:00] Vomero | I saw that I had also sent her a copy, but I didn't take the matter to heart.\n[1976-05-06 10:00:00] Vomero | I watched Nino for a full ten days. I thought about my state during this time, which was completely different from the one I had before, when I was passionately eager to attract men.\n[1976-05-06 10:05:00] Vomero | I didn't joke around with him, nor did I speak to him in a sweet, coquettish way; I didn't show him any of that fawning and eager-to-please attitude; I didn't act like a liberated new woman, as my sister-in-law did; I didn't give him any hints; I didn't look at him with loving eyes; I didn't sit by him when he was sitting at the table, on the sofa, or in front of the TV.\n[1976-05-06 10:10:00] Vomero | I didn't appear disheveled at home; I didn't create opportunities to be alone with him; I didn't brush my elbow against his elbow, my arm against his arm, my leg against his leg, or run into him head-on.\n[1976-05-06 10:15:00] Vomero | I spoke little, made sure he ate well, kept the two children from disturbing him, and let him feel at ease. I thought about how shy and restrained I was at the time. I didn't do it on purpose, because I couldn't have shown any other way.\n[1976-05-06 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw him often joking around with Pietro, Dede, and Elsa, but when he turned to me, he became very serious. I thought he was choosing his words carefully, as if we didn't have so many years of friendship between us, so I also took him seriously.\n[1976-05-06 10:25:00] Vomero | I like to stand far away, avoiding direct contact with him. I thought about how happy I was to have him in my home, but I felt there was no need for me to act affectionately or speak in a tender way. I felt like a raindrop on a spider's web, careful not to slip away.\n[1976-05-06 14:00:00] Vomero | I remember we had only one serious conversation, about my manuscript. As soon as he arrived home, he immediately started talking to me about my manuscript, and he went into great depth, with very sharp analysis. I thought, especially about the part when he first met Elena and Lila, which left a strong impression on him.\n[1976-05-06 14:05:00] Vomero | I saw him asking me. I heard, \"For you, in the biblical story, woman came from man, from the man himself?\"\n[1976-05-06 14:06:00] Vomero | I saw what I said. I heard, \"Eve cannot exist on her own, and she doesn't know how to be independent. She exists outside of Adam, without support of her own. Her good and bad are all decided by Adam. Eve is the female side of Adam. God's creation was so perfect that she didn't know what she was. Her appearance could be shaped, she didn't have her own language, she had no mind or logic of her own, and she could change at any moment.\"\n[1976-05-06 14:07:00] Vomero | I saw Nino's comment. I heard, \"This is a very terrible situation.\"\n[1976-05-06 14:08:00] Vomero | I saw myself glancing at him out of the corner of my eye, wondering if he was making fun of me. I thought about how very uneasy I was.\n[1976-05-06 14:09:00] Vomero | I saw him mention several books I didn't know about, all related to the topic. He once again emphasized that the article could be published. I thought no, he wasn't joking, on the contrary, he had absolutely no sarcastic or joking intention at all.\n[1976-05-06 14:10:00] Vomero | I saw him speaking these words, but he didn't look satisfied at all. In the end, I just said. I heard, \"Mariarosa also really likes this article.\"\n[1976-05-06 14:11:00] Vomero | At that moment, he asked about my sister-in-law, praising Mariarosa, both from the scholar's perspective and for how she took care of Franco Mari. After saying that, he went to the library.\n[1976-05-07 08:00:00] Vomero | I saw that apart from that time, we never had a real conversation. Every morning he went out with Pietro, and came back later than him in the evening.\n[1976-05-09 15:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I remember a few times when we all went out together, like once when he took us to the cinema to watch a movie specially made for children.\n[1976-05-09 15:30:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw Nino sitting next to Pietro, and I was sitting between my two daughters. I thought that when I realized he was laughing, I would laugh too, but I stopped laughing immediately.\n[1976-05-09 16:00:00] Quartiere Spagnolo | When I saw him wanting to buy ice cream for Dede, Elsa, and of course us adults during the break, I gently scolded him, saying. I heard, \"I don't want it, thank you.\"\n[1976-05-09 16:05:00] Cinema Mergellina | I saw him make a few jokes, saying the ice cream was delicious. I didn't eat it, which was my loss. He asked me to try a bit, and I did.",

I thought about the route we took, which left a deep impression on me. Even now, I can point out every street we walked and every corner where we stopped.\n[1976-05-12 16:10:00] Mercato | I saw that we had discussed many issues, and Nino kept talking to the two children. I saw that the weather was extremely hot, and there were many people in the city.\n[1976-05-12 16:30:00] Mercato | I saw him constantly greeting people. Some addressed him with respect, and he introduced me to his friends, using a lot of praise. What surprised me was his fame, how many people knew him.\n[1976-05-12 16:35:00] Mercato | I saw a very famous historian praising my two daughters. I thought, as if they were the children of me and Nino.\n[1976-05-13 19:00:00] Vomero | I thought nothing particularly happened, except that suddenly, for reasons beyond explanation, his relationship with Pietro changed.\n[1976-05-13 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw that everything began one evening during a conversation they had over dinner. Pietro spoke to Nino about a San Gregorio Armeno professor, a figure who was then very prominent.\n[1976-05-13 20:01:00] Vomero | I saw that, Nino said. I heard, \"I'll bet you like that bastard.\"\n[1976-05-13 20:02:00] Vomero | I saw my husband flustered, his smile confused, but Nino emphasized his words, continuing to mock my husband for being too easily deceived by appearances.\n[1976-05-14 08:00:00] Vomero | I saw that this situation was still continuing, and during breakfast the next day, another unpleasant incident occurred—Nino mentioned again the conflict between me and the religious teacher over the Holy Spirit. I thought about how I don't remember how it all began.\n[1976-05-14 08:05:00] Vomero | I saw that Pietro didn't know about it, and he expressed a desire to find out. At that moment, Nino wasn't speaking to him, but rather to the two girls, telling them about their mother's great achievements when she was young.\n[1976-05-14 08:10:00] Vomero | I saw my husband praising me, saying. I heard, \"You were really brave back then.\"\n[1976-05-14 08:11:00] Vomero | I saw him explain to Dede that he had told our daughter the story of the twelve apostles and what happened on the morning of Pentecost: a sound like wind, a fire that spread like wildfire, so that everyone in the world—everyone who spoke any language—understood. I thought about the way he spoke, like someone on TV spouting nonsense, yet he felt it necessary to explain the truth to his daughter.\n[1976-05-14 08:15:00] Vomero | At that moment, I saw my husband deeply engrossed in talking to me and Nino about the afflicted apostles. He mentioned what the prophet Joel had said: \"I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh,\" he said. I heard, \"The Holy Spirit is an essential symbol that allows us to reflect on how different things relate to each other and find common ground.\"\n[1976-05-14 08:20:00] Vomero | I saw Nino kept urging my husband to go on, and finally, he sighed. I heard, \"I'll bet you're hiding a priest in your heart.\" I saw his expression becoming increasingly sarcastic.\n[1976-05-14 08:21:00] Vomero | I saw him teasingly say to me. I heard, \"Are you his wife or his Madonna?\"\n[1976-05-14 08:22:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro turn red, he looked a bit flustered, and finally he said. I heard, \"I'm sorry I wasted your time, let's go to work.\" I thought about Pietro, who always liked to talk about religious issues, and I felt he was somewhat uncomfortable.\n[1976-05-14 20:00:00] Vomero | I was seeing more and more moments like this, without any particularly obvious reason. I thought about how my relationship with Nino remained the same, very polite, courteous, and distant, but he had broken through the barrier with Pietro.\n[1976-05-14 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw, just like at breakfast, that the guest became increasingly disrespectful to the master of the house during dinner, almost to the point of insulting him, all the while keeping a smile on his face. I thought of that kind of behavior which appears friendly on the surface but actually humiliates you, leaving you unable to resist without seeming petty.\n[1976-05-14 20:10:00] Vomero | I thought that was the familiar tone, the one used by the smart people in our Mergellina toward the stupid ones, a kind of intimate gesture that made them submit, left them dialogueless, and turned them into the object of everyone's mockery.\n[1976-05-14 20:15:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro was very uncomfortable, he felt confused: he had a good feeling with Nino, he admired Nino, so he didn't resist.\n[1976-05-14 20:20:00] Vomero | I saw him shaking his head, pretending to be joking. I thought sometimes he seemed to be asking: What did I do wrong? He hoped they could go back to how they were before, speaking to each other in that gentle and harmonious way.\n[1976-05-14 20:25:00] Vomero | I saw that Nino remained calm, sticking to his own way. His words grew heavier, and he turned to me, to the two children, seeking our approval.\n[1976-05-14 20:30:00] Vomero | At that moment, the two children would nod with a smile, and sometimes I would too. I thought, but I wanted to ask: Why did he do that? If Pietro gets angry, their relationship will be ruined.\n[1976-05-14 20:35:00] Vomero | I saw that Pietro wasn't angry, he just didn't understand, but day by day, Nino became more and more annoying to him. I saw his face looked tired, the marks of years of hard study reappeared, he was full of worry, his eyebrows tightly furrowed.\n[1976-05-14 20:40:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, I should take action, I should act immediately, but I did nothing. On the contrary, I found it hard to suppress my admiration for Nino, and the excitement within me — yes, it was excitement.\n[1976-05-14 20:45:00] Vomero | I saw and heard the people from Pietro's family—Pietro, who was very cultured—losing his territory, becoming confused, responding to Nino's brisk, brilliant, even cruel attacks with soft, muddled words. And Nino—Nino was my friend, my classmate, like me, someone born in Mask.\n[1976-05-15 15:00:00] Vomero | I remember one afternoon when Adele Airota called me, and she was very satisfied with what I had written. I know that a few days before Nino returned to San Gregorio Armeno, two especially uncomfortable things happened.\n[1976-05-15 15:05:00] Vomero | I saw her and she told me to send the manuscript to the publisher immediately, so they could quickly put together a booklet to be published at the same time as the French version. If that wasn't possible, it could be published before or after.\n[1976-05-15 20:00:00] Vomero | I mentioned the matter at dinner, and Nino praised me, saying. I heard, \"You have a really great mother.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:01:00] Vomero | I saw and then he asked Pietro. I heard, \"Did you see it?\"\n[1976-05-15 20:02:00] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't have time to look.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:03:00] Vomero | I heard, \"You'd better not look.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:04:00] Vomero | I heard \"Why?\"\n[1976-05-15 20:05:00] Vomero | I heard, \"That's not what you're looking at.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:06:00] Vomero | \"I heard 'that is to say?'\"\n[1976-05-15 20:07:00] Vomero | I heard \"It's too sharp.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:08:00] Vomero | I heard, \"What do you mean?\"\n[1976-05-15 20:09:00] Vomero | I saw him smile and say. I heard, \"You're not as smart as Elena.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro say nothing, while Nino kept provoking him. I heard, \"Are you angry?\"\n[1976-05-15 20:11:00] Vomero | I saw he wanted to continue humiliating Pietro, but Pietro stood up from the table and said. I heard, \"I'm sorry, I have to work.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:12:00] Vomero | I saw myself muttering something. I heard, \"Go after you've eaten.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:13:00] Vomero | I saw him not answer, at first, he seemed really about to walk through the living room and lock himself in the study. I saw us eating in the living room, which was very large.\n[1976-05-15 20:14:00] Vomero | I saw him go around, and finally he sat on the sofa and turned on the TV. I saw the sound turned up loud.\n[1976-05-15 20:15:00] Vomero | I couldn't stand the atmosphere at the time. In just a few days, everything had become extremely complicated, and I felt very unhappy.\n[1976-05-15 20:16:00] Vomero | I saw him saying it. I heard, \"Could you turn the volume down a bit?\"\n[1976-05-15 20:17:00] Vomero | I saw him answer simply and clearly. I heard \"No.\"",

    "text": "[1976-05-15 20:30:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw Nino smile. After he finished eating, he helped me clear the table. In the kitchen, I said to him. I heard, \"Don't be angry with him, Pietro has a lot of work, he sleeps very little.\"\n[1976-05-15 20:31:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw him suddenly angrily say to me. I heard, \"How can you stand him?\"\n[1976-05-15 20:32:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I saw myself watching the door carefully and I answered. \"I love him,\" I heard. I was glad the TV was loud, so no one heard us.\n[1976-05-15 20:33:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I said, seeing him insist on helping me wash the dishes. I heard, \"You go, please, don't make things worse for me.\"\n[1976-05-16 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought of another thing that was even worse, and also decisive—I didn't know, truly, what I wanted: I had already begun to hope that this phase would end as soon as possible, and I wanted to return to my previous daily life, to finish my little book.\n[1976-05-16 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw it, but at the same time, I liked going into Nino's room in the morning, tidying up his messy room, making his bed, and while cooking, thinking about how he would eat with us in the evening. I thought about it, but at the same time I was worried that everything was coming to an end.\n[1976-05-16 15:00:00] Vomero | I thought about certain moments in the afternoon when I felt like a madwoman, even though both children were at home—I felt the house was empty and I felt deeply hollow.\n[1976-05-16 15:05:00] Vomero | I realized I had lost interest in what I was writing. I found it shallow. I had lost confidence in Mariarosa, in Adele Airota, and in the French and Italian publishers.\n[1976-05-16 15:10:00] Vomero | I thought, after Nino left, everything lost its meaning, and at that moment I was in that state: life was slipping away, and I couldn't stand the feeling of loss.\n[1976-05-16 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro return from the university. I thought he seemed more gloomy than usual.\n[1976-05-16 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw that we were all waiting for him to have dinner. Nino had come back half an hour earlier and was already being chased by the two kids.\n[1976-05-16 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw my husband gently asking me. I heard, \"What happened?\"\n[1976-05-16 20:11:00] Vomero | I saw him speak out impulsively. I heard, \"You'll never let your family come to the house again.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:12:00] Vomero | I saw myself freeze all of a sudden, and I thought, he might be referring to Nino.\n[1976-05-16 20:13:00] Vomero | At that moment, Nino also stuck his head in, followed by Dede and Elsa. He probably thought Pietro was referring to him, and a provocative smile appeared on his face, as if he were waiting for Pietro to lose his temper.\n[1976-05-16 20:14:00] Vomero | I saw that Pietro was talking about something else, and he spoke in that very contemptuous tone. I heard, \"Today the police came to see me again. They showed me some photos and told me the name of the person they were looking for.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:15:00] Vomero | I saw myself taking a deep breath. I know that he didn't retract his accusation against the student who was pointing a gun at him, which made more activists among the students and teachers look down on him. The police coming would make them conclude that Pietro was a snitch. I'm sure that's why he was in such a bad mood.\n[1976-05-16 20:16:00] Vomero | I saw that I had interrupted him, and I reproached him for it. I heard, \"This is your fault. You shouldn't have done that. I already told you. Now you can't get rid of these cops.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:17:00] Vomero | I saw Nino interject, asking Pietro in a very rude tone. I heard, \"Who did you betray?\"\n[1976-05-16 20:18:00] Vomero | I saw that Pietro didn't look back at him, he said to me. I heard her say, \"I did my best. I had to do it today. I didn't say anything because it involved you.\" I thought he was angry with me, that he wanted to fight with me.\n[1976-05-16 20:19:00] Vomero | At that moment, I realized the problem wasn't with the police, but with what they were saying. I muttered something under my breath. I heard, \"What does that have to do with me?\"\n[1976-05-16 20:20:00] Vomero | I saw his voice change, he said. I heard, \"Isn't Pasquale and Nadia your friend?\"\n[1976-05-16 20:21:00] Vomero | I repeated it, confused. I heard, \"Pasquale and Nadia?\"\n[1976-05-16 20:22:00] Vomero | I heard, \"The photos of the terrorists that the police showed me included them.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:23:00] New Home | I thought I was dialogueless, unable to say a word, so what I had imagined at that moment was true, and Pietro's words confirmed it.\n[1976-05-16 20:24:00] Vomero | I thought of how Pasquale had pointed a gun at Gino, how he had broken Philip's leg. At that moment, Nadia—Nadia, not Lina—walked up the steps, knocked on Bruno's door, and shot him in the face as she entered.\n[1976-05-16 20:25:00] Vomero | I was terrified! But I felt that Pietro's tone was inappropriate, as if he were using this news to point out something I didn't want to say, embarrassing me in front of Nino.\n[1976-05-16 20:26:00] Vomero | I saw Nino immediately interject, mocking Pietro. I heard, \"It seems like you really are a police informant. You actually did this? You reported those people? Does your father know about this? What about your mother? Your sister?\"\n[1976-05-16 20:27:00] Vomero | I saw myself saying it helplessly. I heard, \"Let's eat.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:28:00] Vomero | I saw and immediately said to Nino. I heard, \"Don't say that, what kind of informant!\" I thought of using a polite way, also to avoid him bringing up Pietro's family background and thereby provoking him.\n[1976-05-16 20:29:00] Vomero | I saw it, and then I said something disordered to Nino. \"I heard that Pasquale Peluso came to see me. I don't know if he still remembers, he was one of the boys from Mergellina, a good guy. Because of various circumstances, Pasquale ended up with Nadia, and he must remember Nadia, Galiani's daughter, that's her.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:30:00] Vomero | At that moment, I stopped because Nino started laughing and said with a sigh. I heard, \"Nadia, my God, Nadia!\"\n[1976-05-16 20:31:00] Vomero | I saw him turn to Pietro and speak to him again in that mocking tone. \"I heard someone say it's crazy to think Nadia Galiani is part of the armed struggle. Only you and those slow cops would believe that. Nadia is the kindest, warmest person I know. What's wrong with Italy? Let's go eat. Anyway, maintaining the established order without you isn't such a big deal anymore.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:32:00] Vomero | I saw him, then he called Dede and Elsa to the dining table. I started setting the food, certain that Pietro would come to eat soon.\n[1976-05-16 20:40:00] Vomero | I thought about him, but he didn't show up. I thought he might have gone to the bathroom, he was stalling, trying to calm himself down.\n[1976-05-16 20:45:00] Vomero | I saw myself sitting in my seat, very excited. I thought about how I wished for a quiet and peaceful night, one that would smoothly bring an end to these days we've lived together.\n[1976-05-16 20:50:00] Vomero | I saw it, but until the two children had finished eating, he still hadn't come out. At that moment, Nino also looked very uneasy.\n[1976-05-16 20:51:00] Vomero | I saw what I said. I heard, \"Eat, or the food will get cold.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:52:00] Vomero | I heard, \"You start eating, then I'll eat.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:53:00] Vomero | I thought about it, and maybe I should go see my husband, see what he was doing, check if he had calmed down, but I didn't want to. His behavior upset me.\n[1976-05-16 20:54:00] Vomero | I thought, usually he never talks about these things. Why didn't he keep the police coming to visit a secret? He never tells me anything about his own affairs.\n[1976-05-16 20:55:00] Vomero | I thought about why he had said such words to me in front of Nino: \"You must never again let your family members come to the house.\"\n[1976-05-16 20:56:00] Vomero | I understood why he was eager to bring the matter up so quickly. He could have waited, he could have held it until later, when we closed the door behind us and he could let it all out.\n[1976-05-16 20:57:00] Vomero | I thought he was angry with me, that was the problem, he wanted to ruin this night, what he did to me didn't matter at all to what I really wanted.\n[1976-05-16 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had started eating, and we four people ate together—first course, second course, and the dessert I had prepared. I thought about Pietro never showing up, and I became utterly furious.\n[1976-05-16 21:05:00] Vomero | I wondered if Pietro didn't want to eat. Well, then he wouldn't eat; it was obvious he wasn't hungry. Did he want to be alone? Well, the house was big, and without him, the atmosphere wouldn't be so tense.\n[1976-05-16 21:10:00] Vomero | I realized clearly that the problem wasn't that the two people who had appeared in our home happened to be militants. The problem was that he didn't have enough intelligence, he couldn't stand the kind of rivalry between men, he felt painful, so he was angry with me.\n[1976-05-16 21:15:00] Vomero | I thought of you, and your sly, stingy nature, what does that have to do with me.\n[1976-05-16 21:16:00] Vomero | I saw myself saying it aloud. \"I'll clean the table later!\" I thought of it as giving myself an order, in order to get things straight.\n[1976-05-16 21:20:00] Vomero | I turned on the TV and sat on the sofa with Nino and the two children.\n[1976-05-16 21:30:00] Vomero | I thought about the long, tormenting moment, and I felt that Nino was a bit uncomfortable, yet also found it amusing.\n[1976-05-16 21:31:00] Vomero | I saw Dede say. I heard, \"I'll go get Dad.\" I thought about how she had finally eaten her fill and was now starting to worry about Pietro.\n[1976-05-16 21:32:00] Vomero | I saw what I said. I heard, \"You go.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:35:00] Vomero | I saw her come back on tiptoe, and she whispered in my ear. I heard, \"He was lying in bed, asleep.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:36:00] Vomero | I saw that Nino also heard it, he said. I heard, \"I'm leaving tomorrow.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:37:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Have you finished your work?\"\n[1976-05-16 21:38:00] Vomero | I heard \"No.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:39:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Stay.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:40:00] Vomero | I heard \"I can't.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:41:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Pietro is a good man.\"\n[1976-05-16 21:42:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Are you protecting him?\"\n[1976-05-16 21:43:00] Vomero | I thought about protecting him? Against whom, in front of whom? I didn't understand, and I almost wanted to be angry with Nino.\n[1976-05-16 22:00:00] Vomero | I saw the two children asleep in front of the TV, and I put them in bed.\n[1976-05-16 22:10:00] Vomero | When I returned to the living room, Nino was already gone. He had locked himself in his room. I felt depressed and cleared the table, washing the plates.\n[1976-05-16 22:30:00] Vomero | I thought about how foolish it was to have asked him to stay, and it would have been better if he had left.\n[1976-05-16 22:35:00] Vomero | I thought of another aspect—I couldn't bear the pale days without him, and I at least had to make him promise me that he would come back soon.\n[1976-05-16 22:40:00] Vomero | I thought about how I wished he would come back, live in my house, and have breakfast together in the morning, and dinner at the same table in the evening.\n[1976-05-16 22:45:00] Vomero | I thought he would say something witty, either lightly or seriously. When I wanted to express my thoughts, he would be there listening to me. No matter what I said, he always listened with respect, never once using a mocking tone toward me.\n[1976-05-16 22:50:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but I have to admit that this relationship has been ruined, and it's no longer possible for us to live together. It was his fault.\n[1976-05-16 22:55:00] Vomero | I thought about how Pietro depended on him, how he longed to be with Nino, how much he valued their friendship, but why did Nino hurt him, humiliate him, and take away his authority?\n[1976-05-16 23:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself removing my makeup, washing my face, and changing into my nightgown.\n[1976-05-16 23:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself locking the door from the inside, adding the security chain, turning off the gas, lowering all the blinds, and turning off the lights.\n[1976-05-16 23:15:00] Vomero | I glanced at the two children, hoping Pietro wasn't pretending to be asleep, waiting to argue with me.\n[1976-05-16 23:20:00] Vomero | I looked at his nightstand; he had already taken the sedative and was completely asleep. He made me feel soft inside, so I gave his cheek a [close, affectionate gesture].\n[1976-05-16 23:30:00] Vomero | I thought to myself how unpredictable he was: very smart, yet also foolish; very sensitive, yet also dull; very brave, yet also cowardly; cultured, yet also ignorant; well-mannered, yet also rude. He was a failure from the Pietro family, a man who had stumbled along the way.\n[1976-05-16 23:35:00] Vomero | I thought about Nino, so confident and decisive. Could he help Pietro, lift him back up, and help him improve himself?\n[1976-05-16 23:40:00] Vomero | I thought again, why has this friendship turned into one-sided hostility.\n[1976-05-16 23:45:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, now I seem to understand—Nino wanted to help me see my husband for what he really was.\n[1976-05-16 23:50:00] Vomero | I thought he was absolutely certain, and in my mind, I had an idealized husband, someone I was dependent on both spiritually and intellectually.\n[1976-05-16 23:55:00] Vomero | I thought he wanted me to see clearly: this young professor was really nothing, although he had written an excellent graduation thesis, published a well-received book, and was currently working on a new one, which, once published, would further solidify and enhance his reputation.\n[1976-05-17 00:00:00] Vomero | I thought about the recent days, and it was as if he had been shouting at me all along: You're living with an ordinary man, with a useless person, and you've even had two daughters.\n[1976-05-17 00:05:00] Vomero | I thought his plan was to free me by belittling my husband, to make me return to myself by destroying him.\n[1976-05-17 00:10:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but when he did it, whether intentionally or not, he presented himself as a standard image of masculinity before me. Did he realize that?\n[1976-05-17 00:15:00] Vomero | I was angry at the thought of this issue; Nino was too reckless, he had disrupted the delicate balance I had worked so hard to maintain.\n[1976-05-17 00:20:00] Vomero | I wondered why he hadn't discussed it with me, messing everything up like this? Who gave him the right to open my eyes and save me?\n[1976-05-17 00:25:00] Vomero | I wondered where he could have guessed that I had this need? He thought, could hecasually change my marital life and my responsibilities as a mother?\n[1976-05-17 00:30:00] Vomero | What was his purpose? What kind of outcome did he want? I thought, it's up to him to figure it out. Has he lost interest in our friendship, or what?\n[1976-05-17 00:35:00] Vomero | I thought that since it's almost vacation time, I'll go to Posillipo. He said he would go to Vomero, where his parents-in-law live.\n[1976-05-17 00:40:00] Vomero | I wondered if we should wait until the end of the holiday to meet again? Why? Actually, during this summer, we had already had the chance to strengthen the relationship between our two families.",

Why couldn't we write letters to exchange our thoughts, or share some books we could read, and talk about our work plans?\n[1976-05-17 01:00:00] Vomero | I couldn't calm down. Nino shouldn't have done that. If he cared about me, he should have acted as he did at the beginning. He should have won Pietro's favor and friendship again. My husband didn't ask for anything else.\n[1976-05-17 01:05:00] Vomero | I thought, does he really believe that putting me in this tense atmosphere is for my own good? No, no, I should talk to him. I have to tell him that treating Pietro that way was stupid.\n[1976-05-17 01:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself carefully getting out of bed, leaving the room, barefoot, walking through the corridor, and knocking on Nino's door.\n[1976-05-17 01:15:00] Nino's Room | I waited a moment, then went in. I saw the room was completely dark.\n[1976-05-17 01:16:00] Nino's Room | I saw and heard him say. I heard, \"You've made up your mind.\"\n[1976-05-17 01:17:00] Nino's room | I was startled when I saw it, and I quickly took off my nightgown, though the weather was hot, I still lay down next to him. I thought I wasn't thinking about making any decision, but I knew he was right—I had already made up my mind.\n[1976-05-17 04:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw it around four in the morning, and I returned to my bed. My husband stirred slightly, muttering something in his sleep. I heard \"What happened?\"\n[1976-05-17 04:01:00] New Home Bedroom | I saw myself speaking to him in a firm and steady tone. I heard, \"Go to sleep.\"\n[1976-05-17 04:02:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw him calm down, and I felt confused. The events that had just happened made me feel happy, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't connect my current situation, this home of Mergellina, and everything that had just happened.\n[1976-05-17 04:05:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought about how everything that happened between me and Nino took place during our time in Mergellina: his parents were moving away, Melina cried out in pain, throwing things out of the window; or on Ischia, when we went for a walk together, holding hands; or in Porto, at the book presentation, when he defended me in front of that strict critic.\n[1976-05-17 04:10:00] New Home Bedroom | I thought about how something like this was happening now, and I felt a bit irresponsible, maybe even innocent, as if, as Lina's friend, Pietro's wife, the mother of Dede and Elsa, I had nothing to do with that girl or woman who had always loved Nino and finally got him.\n[1976-05-17 04:15:00] Posillipo | I felt the traces of his hands and lips still lingering in every part of my body, and the desire for pleasure remained long after. I thought only one thing: it was still a long time until dawn, what was I doing here, and I should go back to him again.\n[1976-05-17 07:00:00] Stazione Centrale | I saw myself gradually calming down, and then I suddenly woke up. When I opened my eyes again, the house was already filled with daylight. I thought, here, in Posillipo, what exactly did I do? It was so stupid.\n[1976-05-17 07:05:00] Stazione Centrale | I thought that now, Pietro would wake up, and the two daughters would wake up too. I should have breakfast ready. Nino would say goodbye to us and return to San Gregorio Armeno, back to his wife and children. And I would return to myself.\n[1976-05-17 07:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself getting up, taking a long shower, drying my hair carefully, doing my makeup meticulously, and putting on my finest clothes, as if I were about to go out.\n[1976-05-17 07:40:00] Vomero | I thought, of course, last night, both Nino and I swore we would never lose each other again, that we would find a way to keep loving each other.\n[1976-05-17 07:45:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but how could we love each other? When would it happen? Why did he come back to find me? Everything that could have happened between us has already happened. What's left is just trouble.\n[1976-05-17 08:00:00] Vomero | I stopped thinking about it and carefully arranged the breakfast. I thought about how I wanted him to have a good impression of the time he spent here, of this house, of the everyday objects, and of me.\n[1976-05-17 08:10:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro's disheveled hair appear, and he was wearing pajamas. He asked. I heard, \"Where are you going?\"\n[1976-05-17 08:10:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Nowhere.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:11:00] Vomero | I saw him looking at me uneasily, and I had never before gotten up so early in the morning and dressed with such care, he said. I heard, \"You look great.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:11:10] Vomero | I heard, \"That's not because of you.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:12:00] Vomero | I saw him walk to the window, look outside, and mutter something. I heard, \"I was very tired last night.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:12:10] Vomero | I heard \"It's also very rude.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:12:20] Vomero | I heard, \"I will apologize to him.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:12:30] Vomero | I heard, \"You should apologize to me first.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:12:40] Vomero | I heard \"I'm sorry.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:12:50] Vomero | I heard, \"He's leaving today.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:20:00] Vomero | At that moment, Dede appeared, her feet bare. I went to get her slippers.\n[1976-05-17 08:25:00] Vomero | I saw that I had awakened Elsa. Usually, before her eyes even opened, she would start kissing me relentlessly. I thought about how soft she was, how warm and comforting her scent was.\n[1976-05-17 08:30:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, yes, the thing has already happened, this thing might never have happened at all, but it's good that it did.\n[1976-05-17 08:35:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, now I should be strict with myself—I would call Mariarosa and ask about things in France; I would talk to Adele Airota, go to the publisher in person, ask them how they intended to handle my manuscript, ask if they really believed it was a good book, or if they were just yielding to my mother-in-law's wishes.\n[1976-05-17 08:40:00] Vomero | I was still reading when I heard footsteps in the corridor. It was Nino. His presence made my heart churn violently. He was still here, but he would be gone soon.\n[1976-05-17 08:41:00] Vomero | I saw myself loosening Elsa's arm around mine and said. I heard, \"I'm sorry, Elsa, Mom is coming back right away.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:42:00] Vomero | I saw myself running away quickly, and Nino came out of the room looking drowsy. I pushed him into the bathroom and closed the door behind me.\n[1976-05-17 08:43:00] Albergheria | I saw us being intimate, and once again I forgot where I was, forgot what time it was. I thought about how good I was at hiding my emotions, my desire for him, which surprised even me.\n[1976-05-17 08:44:00] Albergheria | I saw the kind of fervent embrace we shared, which was something I had never experienced before. I thought of it as if our bodies were colliding with each other, ready to be shattered into pieces.\n[1976-05-17 08:45:00] Albergheria | I thought about the pleasure it was: to be shattered, mixed together, no longer able to tell what was mine and what was his. At that moment, even if Pietro and the two daughters appeared, they wouldn't recognize us.\n[1976-05-17 08:46:00] Albergheria | I saw myself whispering to him. I heard, \"Stay.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:46:10] Albergheria | I heard \"I can't.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:46:20] Albergheria | I heard, \"Then you have to come back, you promised that you would come back.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:46:30] Albergheria | I heard, \"I swear.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:46:40] Albergheria | I heard, \"Call me.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:46:50] Albergheria | I heard \"Good.\"",

Tell me you love me.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:47:10] Albergheria | I heard, \"I love you.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:47:20] Albergheria | I heard \"Say it again.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:47:30] Albergheria | I heard, \"I love you.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:47:40] Vomero | I heard, \"You swear you're not lying.\"\n[1976-05-17 08:47:50] Albergheria | \"I swear.\"\n[1976-05-17 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw Nino leave an hour later, even though Pietro had asked him to stay in a gloomy tone, and even though Dede cried.\n[1976-05-17 09:10:00] Vomero | I saw my husband get up to wash his face. When he came back, he was already dressed and ready to go out. He looked down at me and said. I heard her say, \"I didn't tell the police that Pasquale and Nadia had come to our house; I didn't say anything not to protect you, but because I think that now the Italian police have started mixing up dissidents with criminals.\"\n[1976-05-17 09:11:00] Vomero | I thought about how I hadn't understood what he was saying at the time, and Pasquale and Nadia had completely disappeared from my mind; it was hard for me to regain my composure and remember them.\n[1976-05-17 09:12:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro silently waiting for my reaction, perhaps hoping I would acknowledge what he had said. I thought he hoped that I was standing by his side, at least once agreeing with him, supporting him and helping him face this hot day of the exam.\n[1976-05-17 09:13:00] Vomero | I saw myself just nodding absentmindedly. I thought about his political views, Pasquale and Nadia, Ulrike Meinhof's death, the birth of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and the number of votes that Italy's Communist Party got in the election—what did any of that have to do with me?\n[1976-05-17 09:14:00] Vomero | I thought that the world was retreating behind me, and I was completely lost in myself, in my own body. I felt that it was the only thing I could master, and also the only thing worth being fascinated by.\n[1976-05-17 09:15:00] Vomero | I saw my husband—the witness to order and chaos—close the door behind him, and I felt that I could no longer stand his gaze. I thought about my lips, which had been through [intimate acts], and the painful, feverish ache of them. The exhaustion of the night, and my body, so sensitive it felt like it had been burned. Suddenly, I was clearly seen by him.\n[1976-05-17 09:30:00] Vomero | I thought, as soon as my husband left, I was certain: I would never see Nino again, and I would never be able to talk to him. At the same time, another thought arose: I could no longer live with Pietro.\n[1976-05-17 09:35:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, it's unbearable to continue sleeping in the same bed with him. I want to leave him. I thought, I want to take the two daughters with me.\n[1976-05-17 09:40:00] Vomero | I thought, but what procedures are needed afterward? Is it just a matter of leaving? I don't know any married couple who's divorced, and I don't know anything about divorce.\n[1976-05-17 09:45:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, if I leave Pietro, I'll eventually need a job, and Porto is a suitable place for me because my publisher is there.\n[1976-05-17 09:50:00] Vomero | What about Dede and Elsa? Should I stay at Mergellina? No, absolutely not. Porto is better. Pietro can come see the child whenever he wants.\n[1976-05-17 09:55:00] Vomero | I thought so, even though my mind was on San Gregorio Armeno, I wouldn't go back to ou rMergellina, I would never go back t oMergellina again.\n[1976-05-17 10:00:00] Vomero | I thought about imagining myself living in those dazzling places of San Gregorio Armeno, the places I had never actually lived in, in Tasso Street, not far from Nino's house.\n[1976-05-17 10:05:00] Vomero | I thought about how I would watch him from the window when he went to and from work, how I would meet him on the road every day and talk to him, but I wouldn't bother him, wouldn't cause trouble for his family. Not only that, I also wanted to strengthen my connection with his wife, Elena.\n[1976-05-17 10:10:00] Vomero | I thought that just living quietly beside him was enough, so I went to San Gregorio Armeno instead of Porto.\n[1976-05-17 10:15:00] Vomero | I thought that, for him, I was a married woman living with my family in Mask_loc_002, far away from Mask_loc_001, and in short, I wasn't a free woman.\n[1976-05-17 10:20:00] Vomero | I was thinking about hastily ending my marriage, chasing after him, living near his house—I had no idea what I was thinking! He'd think I was crazy, acting like a brainless little woman.\n[1976-05-17 10:25:00] Vomero | I thought about how my life had lacked so many things, but I still survived. I could live without Nino, too. I would live my own life with my two daughters, walking my own path.\n[1976-05-17 10:30:00] Vomero | I saw it, but at that moment the phone rang. I ran to answer it—it was him. I heard the high-pitched loudspeaker, noise, and commotion in the background, and I could hardly hear what he was saying.\n[1976-05-17 10:31:00] Vomero | I saw him arrive at San Gregorio Armeno and he called me from the train station, he said. I heard, \"I just wanted to say hello to you.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:32:00] Vomero | I saw that he wanted to know how I was, and I answered. I heard \"Very good.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:32:10] Vomero | I heard, \"What are you doing?\"\n[1976-05-17 10:32:20] Vomero | I heard, \"I'm having dinner with two children.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:32:30] Vomero | I heard \"Is Pietro here?\"\n[1976-05-17 10:32:40] Vomero | I heard \"No.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:32:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Do you like having sex with me?\"\n[1976-05-17 10:33:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:33:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Do you like it very much?\"\n[1976-05-17 10:33:20] Vomero | I heard \"I really like it.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:33:30] Vomero | I heard, \"My coins are running out.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:33:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Well, goodbye, thank you for calling.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:33:50] Vomero | I heard \"I'll call back later.\"\n[1976-05-17 10:34:00] Vomero | I heard, \"It can be anytime.\" I felt satisfied with myself and my self-control. I thought I had kept the right distance from him.\n[1976-05-17 13:30:00] Vomero | Three hours later, he called again, still using a public phone. I thought about his uneasy tone.\n[1976-05-17 13:31:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Why are you so cold?\"\n[1976-05-17 13:31:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I'm not cold-hearted.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:31:20] Vomero | I heard him say, \"This morning, you told me to tell you I love you, and I did. Although, by principle, I've never said it to anyone else, not even to my wife.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:31:30] Vomero | I heard, \"I'm happy.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:31:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Do you love me?\"\n[1976-05-17 13:31:50] Vomero | I heard \"Yes.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:32:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Are you sleeping with him tonight?\"\n[1976-05-17 13:32:10] Vomero | I heard, \"So what do you think, should I sleep with whom?\"\n[1976-05-17 13:32:20] Vomero | \"I can't take it anymore.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:32:30] Vomero | I heard, \"You're sleeping with your wife just like everyone else, aren't you?\"\n[1976-05-17 13:32:40] Vomero | I heard, \"But that's not the same thing.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:32:50] Vomero | I heard \"Why?\"\n[1976-05-17 13:33:00] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't care about Elena at all.\"\n[1976-05-17 13:33:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Then come back!\"\n[1976-05-17 13:33:20] Vomero | I heard, \"What am I supposed to do? Leave her, and then what?\"\n[1976-05-17 14:00:00] Vomero | I saw him start to call me very stubbornly, and I liked hearing the phone ring. I thought, especially right after the fight, I didn't know when I'd be able to talk to him again, but he would always call me back within half an hour, sometimes even just ten minutes later.\n[1976-05-17 14:10:00] Vomero | I saw him lose his mind. He asked me if, after we were together, I had slept with Pietro. I told him no, and he made me swear. I swore.\n[1976-05-17 14:15:00] Vomero | I asked him if he had slept with his wife, and he shouted no. I also hoped he would swear it.\n[1976-05-17 14:20:00] Vomero | I saw myself solemnly promising that I would stay at home, so he could find me whenever he wanted.\n[1976-05-17 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw that when I went out by chance — I had to go out to buy something — he would let the phone ring and ring until I came back, put the child down, set down the shopping bags, and even ran to answer his phone before closing the door.\n[1976-05-17 16:05:00] Vomero | I heard him sounding extremely desperate on the other end of the phone. I heard, \"I thought you would never answer my call again.\"\n[1976-05-17 16:05:10] Vomero | I saw him let out a breath and say. I heard, \"If you don't answer my call, I'll keep calling. Without you, I'll fall in love with the sound of the phone ringing, with the sound of a call no one answers, which will be the only thing left to me.\"\n[1976-05-17 16:10:00] Vomero | I saw him go on at great length about the nights we spent together—you remember this, you remember that—he kept repeating those things endlessly.\n[1976-05-17 16:15:00] Vomero | I saw him list the things he wanted to do with me, not just having sex: walking together, traveling, going to movies, dining at restaurants, talking about the work he was doing, and listening to me talk about the progress of my book.\n[1976-05-17 16:20:00] Vomero | I saw it then, and I lost control, I kept saying. I heard, \"Yes, yes, yes, everything, all the things you want.\"\n[1976-05-17 16:21:00] Vomero | I saw myself shouting at him for the last time. I heard, \"In a week, I'm going on vacation with the two kids and Pietro to the seaside.\" I thought about it as I spoke, as if I had been exiled.\n[1976-05-17 16:22:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Elena will go to Vomero in three days. As soon as she leaves, I'll come to Mergellina, even if it's just for an hour.\"\n[1976-05-17 16:23:00] Vomero | I was watching when Elsa looked at me and asked. I heard, \"Mom, why are you talking to someone nonstop? Come play with us.\"\n[1976-05-18 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw one day that Dede said. I heard, \"Don't call her, she's talking to her boyfriend.\"\n[1976-05-20 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw Nino driving out in the evening, and he arrived at Mergellina at nine in the morning.\n[1976-05-20 09:05:00] Vomero | I saw him make a call, it was Pietro who answered, and he hung up the phone.\n[1976-05-20 09:10:00] Vomero | I saw him call again, so I hurried to answer, and he had already parked his car under my building, he said. I heard, \"Come down.\"\n[1976-05-20 09:10:10] Vomero | I heard \"I can't.\"\n[1976-05-20 09:10:20] Vomero | I heard, \"You come down right now, or I'm coming up.\"\n[1976-05-20 09:15:00] Vomero | I saw him looking at the child and I said, I'm going out to buy something for the beach, and I ran to find Nino. I knew there were only a few days left until I had to leave for Posillipo, and Pietro was already on vacation.\n[1976-05-20 09:20:00] In Nino's car | I thought about our next meeting, which was a terrible idea, but we found that the feeling had not weakened at all—it had grown even stronger. Desire burned like a fierce fire, becoming more urgent and unbearable by the minute.\n[1976-05-20 09:25:00] In Nino's car | I thought about it, and now we've met. In this crowded, narrow car, we didn't care at all about the scorching heat. Our crazy idea had become reality, an inevitable thing, like the actions of a chaotic era, chasing impossible things, merging with the reality of that time in a very intimate way.\n[1976-05-20 09:30:00] In Nino's car | I heard, \"Don't go back.\"\n[1976-05-20 09:30:10] In Nino's car | I heard, \"What about the child? What about Pietro?\"\n[1976-05-20 09:30:20] In Nino's car | I heard, \"What are we going to do?\"\n[1976-05-20 10:00:00] In Nino's car | Before I left for San Gregorio Armeno, he said he didn't know if we'd be able to meet again all of August. We said a desperate goodbye.\n[1976-05-20 10:05:00] In Nino's car | I saw him give me the phone number of the place where he lived, and he made me promise to call him every day. I know the apartment we rented in Posillipo doesn't have a phone.\n[1976-05-20 10:06:00] In Nino's car | I heard, \"What if it's your wife who answers?\"\n[1976-05-20 10:06:10] In Nino's car | I heard, \"Then just hang up.\"\n[1976-05-20 10:06:20] In Nino's car | I heard, \"What if you were by the sea?\"\n[1976-05-20 10:06:30] In Nino's car | I heard, \"I have to work, I might not go to the beach.\"\n[1976-05-20 10:10:00] In Nino's car | I saw him tell me to find an excuse to go back to Mergellina, and he would lie to Elena the same way, then come find me. I thought that in our imagination, making a phone call was also meant to set a date, to meet briefly around the time of the Assumption of Mary on August fifteenth.\n[1976-05-20 10:15:00] In Nino's car | I thought it was crazy that we would meet in our home, eat together, sleep together.\n[1976-05-20 10:20:00] In Nino's car | I saw myself intimately touching him, caressing him, biting him. I forced myself away from him, and I felt a painful kind of happiness.\n[1976-05-20 11:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I ran off and bought some towels randomly, a swimsuit for Pietro, a bucket and a shovel for Elsa, and a blue swimsuit for Dede, which she loved at that time.",

    "text": "[1976-08-01 10:00:00] Posillipo | I saw that we were going on vacation, and I didn't pay much attention to the two kids, I almost completely left them with Pietro.\n[1976-08-01 15:00:00] Spaccanapoli | I kept running to find a phone, just to tell Nino that I loved him.\n[1976-08-01 15:05:00] PHONE_BOOTH_018 | I only saw her once or twice, when Elena answered the phone. I immediately hung up, because just hearing her voice filled me with anger.\n[1976-08-01 15:10:00] Capodimonte | I thought it was unfair, why she could be with Nino day and night, what did they have in common?\n[1976-08-01 15:15:00] PHONE_BOOTH_018 | Sometimes, that resentment would help me overcome my fear, making the plan to meet at Mergellina feasible.\n[1976-08-14 10:00:00] Rental House | I told Pietro—this is true—that the Italian publisher, despite their efforts, wouldn't be able to publish my book before January next year, but the French edition would come out at the end of October this year. I needed to clear up a few questions right away, so I needed some books, which meant I had to go home and get them.\n[1976-08-14 10:05:00] Borgo | I saw him volunteer, saying. I heard, \"I'll go get it for you.\"\n[1976-08-14 10:06:00] Mergellina | I heard, \"Stay with the two kids a while longer, you're never ever home.\"\n[1976-08-14 10:07:00] Borgo | I heard, \"I like driving, you don't.\"\n[1976-08-14 10:08:00] Rental House | I heard, \"Can't you just leave me alone? Can't I enjoy a day of freedom? The maids have vacations, why can't I?\"\n[1976-08-15 06:00:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that I had already left early in the morning by car. I saw wisps of white clouds in the sky. The wind blew in through the car window, bringing the scent of summer.\n[1976-08-15 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself entering the empty house, my heart pounding wildly.\n[1976-08-15 09:30:00] New Home | I saw myself taking off my clothes, taking a shower. I looked at the white marks on my stomach and chest in the mirror, and I felt very uncomfortable.\n[1976-08-15 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself wearing clothes, but I wasn't satisfied, so I changed into another set. I took them off and put them on again, over and over, until I was finally satisfied.\n[1976-08-15 15:00:00] Vomero | I saw him around three o'clock, Nino came, I didn't know how he explained it to his wife.\n[1976-08-15 15:30:00] Vomero | I watched us start to make love, all the way until nightfall.\n[1976-08-15 16:00:00] Vomero | I saw it for the first time, and he poured his passion onto me with ease, almost as if it were an act of worship. I found it a bit hard to get used to.\n[1976-08-15 16:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself trying to please him, doing whatever it took to make myself appear a certain way.\n[1976-08-15 17:00:00] Vomero | I saw him, so absorbed, so happy, and suddenly a terrible thought flashed through my mind. I thought to myself that, for me, this was an unique experience, and for him, it was a repetition.\n[1976-08-15 17:05:00] Vomero | I thought about how he loved women, how he admired and was fascinated by their bodies. I wasn't thinking about the three women I knew—Nadia, Sylvia, and Mariarosa, or rather his wife Eleonora.\n[1976-08-15 17:10:00] Vomero | I thought of the woman I knew best—Lina—and the crazy things he had done for her, this kind of fanaticism that almost led him to self-destruction.\n[1976-08-15 17:15:00] Vomero | I thought about how, at that time, she truly believed in that love. She was completely dependent on him, studying the complicated books he read, understanding his thoughts and his ambitions. She was also improving and changing herself to keep up with his pace.\n[1976-08-15 17:20:00] Vomero | I thought of how deep she had sunk, how hard she had fallen when Nino left her.\n[1976-08-15 17:25:00] Vomero | I thought about how he knew how to love someone and make others love him, always in an excessive way. Was there any other way for him? Is the crazy love we have now just a repetition of those other crazy loves?\n[1976-08-15 17:30:00] Vomero | I thought about how this reckless desire for me was actually a pattern, the same pattern he had for Lina? Even now, when he came to our house with Pietro, wasn't it just like when Lina brought him to her and Stefano's house? Were we not just repeating the same thing?\n[1976-08-15 17:35:00] Vomero | I saw myself pulling out my own body, he asked. I heard \"What's wrong with you?\"\n[1976-08-15 17:35:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Nothing, I don't know how to tell you, those are the things that can't be spoken out loud.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:36:00] Vomero | I saw him pull me into his arms, and I [intimate act] with him, at that moment I tried hard to push out of my mind the thought of his love for Lina.\n[1976-08-15 17:37:00] Vomero | I saw that Nino kept pressing me, and I couldn't avoid the question. I seized on a point he had mentioned before—maybe, I could bring it up with him—I asked him in a feigned joking tone. \"I heard myself say, 'Am I also messed up in terms of sex, like Lina?'\"\n[1976-08-15 17:38:00] Vomero | I saw his face change. I saw his eyes and face looked like those of another person, a stranger who frightened me.\n[1976-08-15 17:39:00] Vomero | I hurriedly said something before he could answer. I heard, \"I was just joking. If you don't want to say, then forget it.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:40:00] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:40:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I just said what you said.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:40:20] Vomero | \"I never said such a thing.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:40:30] Vomero | I heard, \"You're lying, that's what you said at Porto, when we were on our way to the restaurant.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:40:40] Vomero | I heard, \"This isn't true, no matter what, I don't want to talk about Lina.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:40:50] Vomero | I heard \"Why?\"\n[1976-08-15 17:41:00] Vomero | I saw that he didn't answer, and a wave of sadness washed over me; I turned away.\n[1976-08-15 17:42:00] Vomero | I saw him running his fingers along my shoulder, I said. I heard, \"Don't touch me.\"\n[1976-08-15 17:43:00] Vomero | I stood there motionless with him for a while, neither of us saying a word. He began to touch me again, gently [intimate action] my shoulder, and I gave in. I thought to myself, yes, he's right, I shouldn't have mentioned Lina.\n[1976-08-15 20:00:00] Vomero | I was still up at night when the phone rang at home. It had to be Pietro and his two daughters.\n[1976-08-15 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw I signaled to Nino to be quiet, then got up from the bed and went to answer the phone.\n[1976-08-15 20:06:00] Vomero | I tried to speak in a very gentle, reassuring voice, but I didn't realize that I had lowered my voice too much, speaking in an unnatural, hushed tone. I thought I didn't want Nino to hear my voice; he would tease me, maybe even get angry.\n[1976-08-15 20:07:00] New Home | I saw Pietro ask. I heard, \"Why are you speaking so quietly? Is everything okay?\"\n[1976-08-15 20:08:00] Vomero | I saw that, and I immediately raised my voice. This time my voice was too loud, so I tried to speak in a warm tone to Elsa for a long time, then reminded Dede to be good and not make her father worry too much. [Intimate act] should be preceded by brushing teeth.\n[1976-08-15 20:10:00] Vomero | I said when I saw myself getting back into bed, Nino. I heard, \"What a wonderful wife, what a wonderful mother she is!\"\n[1976-08-15 20:10:10] Vomero | I saw myself answering. I heard, \"You're still the same.\"\n[1976-08-15 20:15:00] New Home | I watched as the tense atmosphere eased, waiting for my husband and daughters' voices to fade away.",

    "text": "[1976-08-15 20:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself taking a shower with Nino, and I was very happy. It was a brand-new experience, and I liked giving him a shower, and letting him wash me too.\n[1976-08-15 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself getting dressed up for him again, but this time, under his eyes, that familiar unease suddenly disappeared.\n[1976-08-15 21:10:00] Vomero | I saw him staring at me intently as I tried on clothes, looking for one that fit.\n[1976-08-15 21:20:00] Vomero | I saw him watching me put on my makeup, and I smiled at him from time to time. \"I heard, 'Don't touch me, don't tickle me, if I start laughing, my makeup will be ruined, and I'll have to redo it, be careful with my clothes, don't rip them, let me go.'\"\n[1976-08-15 21:30:00] Vomero | I saw him standing behind me, kissing my neck, slipping his hand inside my collar or underneath my dress.\n[1976-08-15 21:40:00] New Home | I was worried that someone might see us together, even though the whole building was empty and everyone was on vacation.\n[1976-08-15 21:45:00] Vomero | I saw that I had finished packing and was ready to go out, so I let him go out first and wait for me in the car.\n[1976-08-15 22:00:00] Restaurant Mergellina | I saw us having dinner together, eating a lot, drinking a lot, and talking a great deal.\n[1976-08-15 23:30:00] Vomero | I saw that when we got home, we had [intimate contact] again, but we never went to sleep.\n[1976-08-15 23:40:00] Vomero | I saw him say it to me. I heard, \"October, I'm going to Montpellier for five days, there's a seminar there.\"\n[1976-08-15 23:40:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I hope you have a good time, are you going with your wife?\"\n[1976-08-15 23:40:20] Vomero | I heard, \"I want to go with you.\"\n[1976-08-15 23:40:30] Vomero | I heard \"Impossible.\"\n[1976-08-15 23:40:40] Vomero | \"I heard 'Why?'\"\n[1976-08-15 23:40:50] Vomero | I heard, \"Dede is six now, Elsa is only three, I have to take care of them.\"\n[1976-08-16 00:00:00] Vomero | I saw us start discussing our situation, bringing up for the first time things like marriage and children, then we moved from despair to sex, and from sex back to despair.\n[1976-08-16 01:00:00] Vomero | I saw it to the end, and muttered something. I heard, \"We'll never see each other again.\"\n[1976-08-16 01:00:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Even if you can do it, I can't.\"\n[1976-08-16 01:00:20] Vomero | \"I heard, 'Nonsense. You've known me for decades, yet I've never been part of your life. But you've lived so richly, and you'll soon forget me.'\"\n[1976-08-16 01:00:30] Vomero | I heard, \"You have to promise me, call me every day.\"\n[1976-08-16 01:00:40] Vomero | I heard, \"No, I'm never calling you again.\"\n[1976-08-16 01:00:50] Vomero | I heard, \"If you don't hit me, I'll go crazy.\"\n[1976-08-16 01:01:00] Vomero | I heard, \"If I keep thinking about you, I'll go crazy too.\"\n[1976-08-16 01:30:00] Vomero | I saw us exploring the dead end we were in, driven by a masochistic passion. The combined obstacles we faced finally led us to argue.\n[1976-08-16 06:00:00] Vomero | I saw him leave at six in the morning, very agitated.\n[1976-08-16 06:30:00] Vomero | I cried my eyes out, then tidied up the house.\n[1976-08-16 08:00:00] The road from Mergellina to Posillipo | I kept hoping that we would never reach Posillipo during the entire drive.\n[1976-08-16 09:00:00] The highway from Mergellina to Posillipo | I realized halfway through that I hadn't taken any books with me, and the whole purpose of this trip was to get them. I thought: better be sure.\n[1976-09-15 18:00:00] Vomero | I saw that we had returned to Mergellina, and our conversation was limited to the most basic everyday exchanges. I know that when both daughters are present, we will use a friendly tone.\n[1976-09-15 22:00:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro sleeping in his study, while I was lying on our marital bed. I know, like the phase when Dede was just born and wouldn't sleep at night. I thought about how desperately I had tried to figure out what to do.\n[1976-09-15 22:10:00] Vomero | I thought the way Lina and Stefano ended their marriage was of no relevance to me, because it was something from another era, and they hadn't gone through legal means.\n[1976-09-15 22:15:00] Vomero | I thought about resolving the issue in a civilized way, through legal means, in a manner that fit this era and our situation, but I still didn't know what to do, so I took no action at all.\n[1976-09-16 10:00:00] Vomero | I called Mariarosa and she told me that the French version of the pamphlet was ready, and the serious, meticulous editor from the publisher had also informed me to revise some passages in the book. I know I'm back at Mergellina. I thought I was quite happy at the time, and I tried to regain my spirit and throw myself back into work, but I found I couldn't. I felt that there was something seriously wrong with my article—not just a few sentences that were misinterpreted or some paragraphs that weren't smooth.\n[1976-10-05 09:00:00] Vomero | I remember that one morning later, the phone rang, and it was Pietro who answered. He said. I heard \"Hello.\"\n[1976-10-05 09:00:10] Vomero | I saw it was hanging up, my heart started to pound wildly. I had already prepared myself to rush over before my husband answered the phone, but the phone never rang again.\n[1976-10-05 13:00:00] Vomero | I tried to distract myself, I kept staring at what I had written, I was completely exhausted, and I collapsed face down on the table. I knew it had been several hours. I thought it wasn't a good idea, and I felt like everything I wrote was nonsense.\n[1976-10-05 13:05:00] Vomero | I saw it, but at that moment the phone rang again. It was my husband who answered, shouting, \"Hello!\" Then he dropped the receiver as if he wanted to smash the phone. I thought of that and it scared Dede.\n[1976-10-05 13:10:00] Vomero | I thought it was Nino, I knew it was him, and Pietro knew too. The day of the seminar was approaching day by day, and of course he insisted that I go with him; his goal was to pull me into the vortex of sensual desire.\n[1976-10-05 13:15:00] Vomero | I thought about how he showed me that the only way out of our secret affair was to burn it to ashes in evil and pleasure, by betraying each other, fabricating lies, and then leaving together.\n[1976-10-05 13:20:00] Vomero | I thought about how I would take my first plane ride, the plane taking off, me pressing closely against him, just like I had seen on television.\n[1976-10-05 13:25:00] Vomero | Why not, after the Montpellier meeting, we might go to Nanterre, we'll look for Mariarosa's friend, I'll talk to her about my book, and I'll introduce Nino to her, and we'll attend the event together.\n[1976-10-05 13:30:00] Vomero | I thought, yes, a man I love is with me, his strength will support me, no one can ignore his strength. The hostility gradually faded, and I felt myself brimming with excitement.\n[1976-10-06 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw that the next day, Pietro went to the university, and I waited for Nino to call again, but nothing happened.\n[1976-10-06 10:00:00] Vomero | I gave in to a sudden impulse and called him, waiting for the phone to ring a few times. I thought about how I had been dying to hear his voice, and how excited I had been at that moment.\n[1976-10-06 10:01:00] Vomero | After thinking about it, I didn't know what I would do. Maybe I would curse him, start crying, or shout at him: \"Okay, I'll go with you. I'll be your mistress until you get tired of me.\" At that moment, all I hoped for was: he would answer my call.\n[1976-10-06 10:02:00] Vomero | I saw it was Elena who answered the phone, and I quickly controlled my voice, suppressing the words I wanted to say to him. I immediately spoke in a cheerful tone. I heard, \"Hello, this is Elena Greco. Are you okay? How was your vacation? How is Albert?\" I thought, I imagined, Nino was panting as he ran toward the phone.\n[1976-10-06 10:03:00] Vomero | I watched her silently listen to me, then start cursing violently. \"I heard, 'Are you Elena Greco? You bitch! Hypocritical bitch, stop harassing my husband and stop calling me. I know where you live. If you keep seducing my husband, I'll go to your house and tear your face off.'\"\n[1976-10-06 10:04:00] Vomero | I saw her hang up the phone in the end.\n[1976-10-06 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw myself sitting in front of the phone, not sure how long I had been there. I thought my heart was filled with hatred.\n[1976-10-06 10:06:00] Vomero | I thought of the sentences that flooded my mind: \"Okay, come on, you're coming right now. You rotten woman, I'm waiting for you. Goddamn, where are you? At Tasso Street? In Via Filangieri? Via Cristoppo? Or Via Santarella? You stupid fucking bitch! Do you want to fight with me?\"\n[1976-10-06 10:07:00] Vomero | I thought of another self rising from within me, another me who had long been hidden beneath my gentle surface, but who now emerged, arguing with me in a mix of dialect and Italian, confusing me to no end.\n[1976-10-06 10:08:00] Vomero | I thought, if Elena dared to come to my house, I would spit in her face, I would push her down the stairs, I would pull her hair and drag her into the street, I would smash her full-of-shit head against the sidewalk.\n[1976-10-06 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw and felt a sharp pain in my chest, my temples were throbbing. I saw workers downstairs working on construction. Heat, dust, and the noise of people moving around poured in through the open window, along with the loud rumbling from some unknown machine, which was extremely annoying.\n[1976-10-06 10:12:00] Vomero | I saw Dede and Elsa arguing in another room, and Dede was speaking. I heard, \"You don't need to imitate everything I do. You're a monkey, and monkeys like to imitate people.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:15:00] Vomero | I thought, slowly, I understood: Nino had already decided to confront his wife, and that was why she had cursed me.\n[1976-10-06 10:16:00] Vomero | I saw and let out a happy sigh. I thought about how my uncontrollable anger had turned into an unbearable pleasure. Nino wanted me; he had confessed to his wife about us, he had destroyed his marriage, he had consciously given up the benefits that marriage had brought him. His whole life had already tilted, and for me, he had chosen to make Elena and Albert suffer. Therefore, he truly loved me.\n[1976-10-06 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw that the phone was ringing again, so I immediately answered it.\n[1976-10-06 10:21:00] Vomero | I saw it was Nino. He said his marriage had ended, that he was free now, and he asked me. I heard, \"Did you tell Pietro?\" I thought of his voice, and I felt he was calm.\n[1976-10-06 10:21:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I started talking to him.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:21:20] Vomero | I heard, \"You haven't told him yet?\"\n[1976-10-06 10:21:30] Vomero | I heard \"It's about done.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:21:40] Vomero | I heard, \"Do you want to step back?\"\n[1976-10-06 10:21:50] Vomero | I heard \"Don't want to.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:22:00] Vomero | I heard, \"Then hurry up, we're about to leave.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:23:00] Vomero | I thought he had already decided I would go with him, that we would meet at Rome, and everything was already booked: the hotel, the plane tickets.\n[1976-10-06 10:24:00] Vomero | I saw myself gently saying to him. \"I heard, 'I have a problem with my child.'\" I thought about it, but not at all confidently.\n[1976-10-06 10:24:10] Vomero | \"I heard, 'Have your mother take care of him for a few days.'\"\n[1976-10-06 10:24:20] Vomero | I heard, \"Don't even think about it.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:24:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Then take them with you.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:24:40] Vomero | I heard, \"You mean it's really true?\"\n[1976-10-06 10:24:50] Vomero | I heard \"Yes.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:25:00] Vomero | \"I heard, 'No matter what, you'll take me along? And also take my two daughters?'\"\n[1976-10-06 10:25:10] Vomero | I heard, \"Of course.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:25:20] Vomero | I saw myself speaking in a whisper. I heard, \"You really love me.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:25:30] Vomero | I heard, \"Yes.\"\n[1976-10-06 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought of how suddenly I felt full of strength, nothing could stop me, just like a time from the past when I believed everything was possible.\n[1976-10-06 10:35:00] Vomero | I thought to myself that I was born lucky, and even when fate seemed turbulent, it was only laying the groundwork for what was to come.\n[1976-10-06 10:40:00] Vomero | I thought, of course, I have my own strengths. I'm disciplined, have a good memory, can endure hardship. I'm likable. I've learned the language and thinking tools of men. I can give logic to any fragmented thing.\n[1976-10-06 10:45:00] Vomero | I thought that luck was more important than anything else, and I happily felt that fate was with me like a loyal friend. Fate was again on my side, giving me a sense of security.\n[1976-10-06 10:50:00] Vomero | I thought about the possibility of a conflict with my husband, how he would suffer, but in the end, we would find a solution.\n[1976-10-06 10:55:00] Vomero | I thought that definitely, abandoning marriage and family would be an extremely painful thing.\n[1976-10-06 11:00:00] Vomero | I thought that because of our different reasons, none of us wanted to tell the relatives, and we would try our best to keep it a secret, for as long as we could.\n[1976-10-06 11:05:00] Vomero | I thought we didn't expect to tell Pietro's family right away, although at any time, they knew how to deal with such things, and when faced with complicated situations, they knew who to turn to.\n[1976-10-06 11:10:00] Vomero | I thought I had finally calmed down, that we were two rational adults who would face the issue, discuss it, and clarify things.\n[1976-10-06 11:15:00] Vomero | I thought about how, in the chaos within me during those few hours, the one thing I couldn't let go of was: going to Montpellier.\n[1976-10-06 20:00:00] Vomero | I told my husband about it that evening, and I confessed everything to him. I heard, \"Nino is my lover.\"\n[1976-10-06 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw that he simply refused to believe it was true. When I told him again and again that it was a fact, he cried and begged me.\n[1976-10-06 20:10:00] Vomero | I saw him get angry. He picked up the glass from the coffee table and threw it against the wall. I saw, under the terrified glances of my two daughters.\n[1976-10-06 20:15:00] Vomero | I saw them standing at the threshold of the living room watching us, but I didn't back down. I saw that my two daughters were already asleep, but they had been awakened by the shouting. I thought about it and it made me feel uneasy.\n[1976-10-06 20:30:00] Vomero | I saw myself putting Dede and Elsa back into bed, calming them down and waiting for them to fall asleep, then going back to face my husband. I thought that every minute was a wound.\n[1976-10-06 21:00:00] Vomero | I saw that, and Elena started calling us constantly, day and night. She cursed me, and she also cursed Pietro, saying he didn't know how to be a man.\n[1976-10-06 21:05:00] Vomero | I saw her threatening me. I heard, \"My relatives will make us, and even our children, unable to cry.\"\n[1976-10-06 22:00:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but that didn't discourage me. I was in a very excited state, and I felt no sense of guilt at all.\n[1976-10-06 22:05:00] Vomero | I thought the opposite; I felt that the pain I caused, the humiliation and attacks I endured, were all to my advantage.",

I heard, \"They're young, what would they know?\"\n[1976-10-07 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw him, but later he shouted at me. I heard her say, \"If you decide to leave, you have to explain to your daughters why you're going. If you don't have the courage, then don't go. If you don't say anything, it means you're not sure about what you want to do.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:06:00] Vomero | I heard myself mutter something. I heard, \"We'll talk to the lawyer.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:07:00] Vomero | I saw him say. I heard, \"There's plenty of time to find a lawyer.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw him suddenly shout for Dede and Elsa. I know that now, whenever they hear us shouting, they'll lock themselves in their room, all of them in complete agreement.\n[1976-10-07 10:15:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro start to speak. \"I heard, 'Your mother has something to say to you. Sit down and listen.'\"\n[1976-10-07 10:16:00] Vomero | I saw my two daughters sitting on the sofa, waiting for me to speak.\n[1976-10-07 10:17:00] Vomero | I saw that I had already started speaking. I heard, \"I was very much in love with your father, but now we have nothing in common, so we've decided to separate.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:18:00] Vomero | I saw Pietro calmly interrupt me. I heard, \"This isn't true. It was your mother who decided to leave me. Our love wasn't real—she doesn't want me anymore.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:19:00] Vomero | I saw my emotions becoming agitated, and I said. \"I heard, 'Children, it's not that simple. Even though they don't live together, two people can still love each other.'\"\n[1976-10-07 10:20:00] Vomero | I saw him interrupt me again. I heard, \"This isn't real either. Either we love each other and live together, becoming a family; or we don't love each other, and then we part, and that's not a family anymore. If you lie, how can they understand? Please, be clear about the real reason we're breaking up.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:21:00] Vomero | I saw what I said. I heard her say, \"I'm not leaving you. You are the most important people to me. I can't live without you. It's just that I have a problem with your father.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:22:00] Vomero | I saw him pressing me. I heard, \"What's the problem? Say it clearly what the problem is.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:23:00] Vomero | I saw myself sigh and say in a low voice. \"I heard, 'I've fallen in love with someone else, and I've decided to live with him.'\"\n[1976-10-07 10:24:00] Vomero | I saw Elsa glancing at Dede, trying to figure out what reaction she should make. When she saw that Dede remained unmoved, she too acted as if she were unmoved.\n[1976-10-07 10:25:00] Vomero | I saw it, but at that moment, my husband lost his patience and shouted. I heard, \"Say his name, tell them what this man's name is. You don't want to say it? Are you shy? I'll say it—this man you know, he's Nino, do you remember him? Your mothers are going to live with him.\"\n[1976-10-07 10:26:00] Vomero | I saw and then he cried out in despair. At that moment, Elsa asked quietly, full of concern. I heard, \"Mom, will you take me with you?\"\n[1976-10-07 10:27:00] Vomero | I saw it, but before I could answer, she saw my sister stand up and leave, and she immediately followed her.\n[1976-10-08 02:00:00] Vomero | That night, I saw Dede crying out in her dream, and I suddenly woke up, ran to check on her.\n[1976-10-08 02:05:00] Vomero | I saw her asleep, but she had wet the bed. I had to wake her up, change her clothes, and change the sheets.\n[1976-10-08 02:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself putting her on the bed, and she mumbled that she wanted to sleep in my bed. I agreed, and let her sleep next to me.\n[1976-10-08 02:15:00] Vomero | I saw that in her dreams, she sometimes trembled, feeling around to make sure I was still by her side.\n[1976-10-10 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that it was already the day to leave, but my discussion with Pietro had not made any progress. I thought that even when it came to going to Montpellier, we couldn't reach an agreement.\n[1976-10-10 10:05:00] Vomero | I saw him say it. \"I heard, 'Go! I'll never let you see the two children again.'\"\n[1976-10-10 10:06:00] Vomero | I saw and then said. \"I heard, 'If you take the two children away, I'll [tragic event].\"\n[1976-10-10 10:07:00] Vomero | I saw, or rather. I heard, \"I'm going to report you for abandoning the family.\"\n[1976-10-10 10:08:00] Vomero | I saw or. I heard, \"Let's all go on a trip together, let's go to Vienna.\"\n[1976-10-10 10:09:00] Vomero | I saw or. I heard, \"Children, your mother would rather have Mr. Nino than us.\"\n[1976-10-10 10:15:00] Vomero | I thought I had begun to feel unbearable, I remember the resistance he showed when I left Antonio.\n[1976-10-10 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought of Antonio, who was very young at the time, and he inherited Melina's fragile and unstable nerves. Moreover, he didn't have Pietro's cultural background; he hadn't been trained from childhood to find order in chaos.\n[1976-10-10 10:25:00] Vomero | I thought, maybe I had overestimated the cultivation of reason, refined reading, elegant language, and political leanings. Maybe when faced with abandonment, everyone's reaction is the same. Even a very orderly mind cannot bear the pain of not being loved.\n[1976-10-10 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought of my husband—there was really nothing to be done—he was certain he had to protect me at all costs, from the poison of desire.\n[1976-10-10 10:35:00] Vomero | I thought about how he had chosen unscrupulous methods, even despicable ones, to continue being my husband.\n[1976-10-10 10:40:00] Vomero | I thought about how he had once suggested we not get married in a church, and how he had always supported divorce. Yet in his incomprehensible heart, he still hoped our relationship would be eternal, as if we had actually gotten married in a church.\n[1976-10-10 10:45:00] Vomero | I saw that I was determined to end our relationship. At first, he tried every way to persuade me, then he threw things, slapped himself, and suddenly began to sing.\n[1976-10-10 10:50:00] Vomero | I saw him become so exaggerated, so unreasonable, which made me angry, and I would curse at him.\n[1976-10-10 10:55:00] Vomero | I would usually run to me like a frightened little animal, apologizing to me, he said. I heard, \"I'm not angry at you, my mind is the problem.\"\n[1976-10-10 20:00:00] Vomero | I saw one night, he cried and confided in me. I heard, \"Adele Airota has always been betraying my father, something he found out when he was a child.\"\n[1976-10-10 20:05:00] Vomero | I saw him, when he was six years old, seeing her kiss a tall man. I know that at the time, I was in a living room in Genoa facing the sea, and the man was wearing a blue suit.\n[1976-10-10 20:10:00] Vomero | I thought about how he remembered every detail: the man had a thick mustache like a black blade, a metal plate on his pants that looked like a 100-lira coin; his mother pressed against him, like an open bow, as if it might snap at any moment.\n[1976-10-10 20:15:00] Vomero | I saw myself silently listening to him and trying to comfort him, and I said. I heard, \"Relax a bit, these are all false memories. You know they're fake, so I shouldn't have to remind you.\"\n[1976-10-10 20:16:00] Vomero | I saw, but he would continue to speak. I heard that \"Adele Airota was wearing a pink slip dress, the strap had slipped off her tanned shoulder, her nails looked like glass, and her hair was braided into a long braid that hung down her neck like a snake.\"\n[1976-10-10 20:17:00] Vomero | I saw his tone shift from pain to anger, he said in the end. I heard, \"Do you understand what you've done to me? Do you understand the terrible situation you've put me in?\"\n[1976-10-10 20:20:00] Vomero | I thought at that moment: Dede will also remember this, and when she grows up, will she say something similar?\n[1976-10-10 20:25:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but I didn't go in that direction. I was certain that after so many years, Pietro finally mentioned his mother to me, deliberately making me think that way—just to hurt me and keep me.",

I thought about how, when I told him about all the pressures and worries I'd been through, he didn't comfort me at all, but instead became very annoyed.\n[1976-10-15 10:10:00] Vomero | I saw him say it. I heard her say, \"Do you think things are easier for me here, just like they are where you are? It's the same hell. I'm afraid of Elena, I don't know what she might do. So don't think my situation is any better than yours—I'm only in a worse place here.\"\n[1976-10-15 10:11:00] Vomero | I saw it, and then he sighed. I heard, \"But the two of us together are stronger than anyone else. Our union is unstoppable, and I'm very sure of that. Do you know that? Tell me, I want to hear your thoughts.\"\n[1976-10-15 10:15:00] Vomero | I thought his words were of no help to me. I had used all my strength to face this terrible situation, and what I thought of was the moment we met, flying together to France.\n[1976-10-15 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought to myself, I should hold on until that moment, and then speak.\n[1976-10-15 10:25:00] Vomero | I thought, now I just long for this intense pain to ease up a little, I can't stand it anymore.\n[1976-10-16 12:00:00] Vomero | I remember once, in front of Dede and Elsa, my husband and I had a fierce argument, and I said to Pietro. I heard, \"Enough! I'm only going away for five days. When I come back, we'll see what to do, okay?\"\n[1976-10-16 12:01:00] Vomero | I saw him say to his two daughters. I heard, \"Did you believe that your mother said she would only be gone for five days?\"\n[1976-10-16 12:02:00] Vomero | I saw Dede shaking her head, and Elsa did the same.\n[1976-10-16 12:03:00] Vomero | I saw that, Pietro said. I heard, \"Even they don't believe it, we all know you're leaving us and never coming back.\"\n[1976-10-16 12:04:00] Vomero | At that moment, Dede and Elsa both rushed toward me without saying a word, wrapping their arms around my legs and begging me not to leave, to stay with them.\n[1976-10-16 12:05:00] Vomero | I saw that I hadn't broken down, I crouched down and hugged their waists, I said. I heard, \"Okay, I won't go. You're my good children, and I want to stay with you.\"\n[1976-10-16 12:06:00] Vomero | I saw and heard this, and they were relieved; Pietro also gradually relaxed, and I returned to my own room.\n[1976-10-16 12:10:00] Vomero | I thought, Oh my God! Everything had become so abnormal: me, them, and the world around us.\n[1976-10-16 12:15:00] Vomero | I thought that only through lies could I find a moment of peace.\n[1976-10-17 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that there were two days left before departure, so I first wrote a long letter to Pietro, then a short one to Dede, asking her to read it aloud to Elsa.\n[1976-10-17 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw myself packing my luggage and placing it under the bed in the guest room.\n[1976-10-17 12:00:00] Vomero | I saw that I had bought a lot of things, filling up the refrigerator.\n[1976-10-17 20:00:00] Vomero | When dinner time came, I prepared the things Pietro loved, and he ate them eagerly, full of gratitude toward me.\n[1976-10-17 20:30:00] Vomero | I saw the two children relax; they would soon start arguing over something trivial again.\n[1976-10-18 10:00:00] Vomero | I saw that when it was almost time to leave, Nino stopped calling altogether.\n[1976-10-18 10:05:00] Vomero | I tried to call him, hoping it wouldn't be Elena who answered, and finally, the housekeeper picked up.\n[1976-10-18 10:06:00] Vomero | I let out a sigh of relief, I said. I heard, \"I'm looking for Professor Nino.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:07:00] Vomero | I saw her answer was straightforward and unreserved, she said. I heard, \"I'll have the lady come on the phone.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:08:00] Vomero | I saw myself hanging up the phone and started waiting. I thought about how I wished my phone would become the spark that triggered their marital conflict, and I hoped that Nino would know that I had called him.\n[1976-10-18 10:18:00] Vomero | I saw ten minutes later, the phone rang, and I immediately ran to answer it. I was sure it was him at first, but this time it was Lina's call.\n[1976-10-18 10:20:00] Vomero | I thought about how it had been a long time since we last talked, and I didn't want to speak to her—her voice annoyed me.\n[1976-10-18 10:21:00] Vomero | I thought that, at this stage, even her name, like a snake slithering through my mind, would throw me into chaos, drain all my strength, and this was certainly not the time for conversation.\n[1976-10-18 10:22:00] Vomero | I thought that if Nino called at this moment, he would find the line busy, and our communication had already become so difficult.\n[1976-10-18 10:23:00] Vomero | I saw her when I asked her. I heard, \"Can I call you back later? Do you have an emergency?\"\n[1976-10-18 10:23:10] Vomero | I heard \"A bit.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:24:00] Vomero | I saw her ignore my request. I thought that usually, she felt she could freely enter and exit my life without any formalities, as if we were still one and the same, without needing to ask: \"Are you okay? How are you? Am I disturbing you?\"\n[1976-10-18 10:25:00] Vomero | I saw her speak in a very tired voice. I heard, \"I just heard some terrible news: the mother of the Solara brothers was killed.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:26:00] Vomero | I saw her speaking slowly, as if choosing her words carefully. I kept listening to her without interrupting. I thought about what she had said, which set off a chain of associations in my mind: the woman dressed in her finest, sitting at the table of the bride and groom at Lina and Stefano's wedding; the ghost-like woman who opened the door for me when I went to see Michele; the woman in our childhood imagination who killed Don Achille with a knife; and the old woman with a flower on her head, fanning herself with a light blue fan, muttering to herself: \"I feel so hot, don't you?\"\n[1976-10-18 10:27:00] Vomero | I thought about it, but now I feel nothing. Even when Lina listed some of the stories she had heard and vividly told them to me, I felt nothing: they killed Manuela by slashing her throat with a dagger; or they shot her, five bullets in total, four in her chest and one in her neck; or they beat her at home, punching and kicking her to death; or the killers—she called them that—didn't even enter the house. As soon as the door opened, they shot her. Manuela fell headfirst down the stairs, while her husband was watching TV and didn't even realize what had happened.\n[1976-10-18 10:28:00] Vomero | I saw Lina say. \"I heard that 'The only thing we can be sure of is that the Solara brothers are crazy now. They're competing with the police to see who finds the killer first. They've brought in everyone from San Gregorio Armeno, and they've stopped everything they were doing. I'm not even going to work today. The atmosphere here is terrifying; no one dares to breathe loudly.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:30:00] Vomero | I thought about all these things happening to her, and the things around her—how she was so good at giving them significance and depth: a moneylender woman had her throat cut, her two sons had become extremely violent, their henchmen were already ready for revenge, and she was now right in the middle of this turmoil.\n[1976-10-18 10:35:00] Vomero | I didn't realize the real reason she had called until I finished reading. I heard him say, \"Tomorrow, I'll send Gennaro to you. I know, I shouldn't be adding to your burden, you have your own daughter to take care of and your own things to do. But right now, I can't leave him here. He'll miss some classes, but there's nothing I can do. He's very attached to you, and he's been doing well with you. You're the only one I trust.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:36:00] Vomero | I thought about the last thing she said: \"You're the only person I trust,\" which made me smile. She didn't know, I had already become someone untrustworthy.\n[1976-10-18 10:37:00] Vomero | I thought that she, with a clear conscience, believed I was still, as usual, using the most steady rationality to keep myself in a state of calm and peace. So she would make such a request of me. It seemed as though she thought my life was like a bright red fruit growing on the branch of an artificial leaf tree.\n[1976-10-18 10:38:00] Vomero | I saw myself speaking without hesitation, saying it to her. I heard, \"I'm leaving, I'm going away from my husband.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:38:10] Vomero | I heard, \"I don't understand.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:38:20] Vomero | I heard, \"My marriage is over, Lina. I met Nino, and we found out that without realizing it, we've always been in love, since childhood. So I'm leaving here, I'm starting a new life.\"",

I heard \"Are you joking?\"\n[1976-10-18 10:39:10] New Home | I heard \"No.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:40:00] Vomero | I thought she must have felt that I couldn't possibly mess up my family or my orderly mind.\n[1976-10-18 10:41:00] Vomero | I saw it now, and she almost mechanically spoke about my husband, she said. I heard, \"Pietro is a great man, he's kind and very smart. Leaving him is just crazy. Think about the harm you're causing your two daughters.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:42:00] New Home | I thought about the time she said those words, never once mentioning Nino, as if the name had stopped at her ears and never entered her mind.\n[1976-10-18 10:43:00] Vomero | I realized I should be the one to mention him, so I said. \"I heard, 'No, Lina, I can't live with Pietro because I can't leave Nino anymore. No matter what happens, I have to go with him.'\" I thought of other things I had said, and they all sounded as solemn as an award ceremony.\n[1976-10-18 10:44:00] Vomero | At that moment, she began to scream. \"I heard you threw all this away just because of Nino? You destroyed your family just for that man? Do you know what's going to happen? He'll use you, drain you dry, take away your will to live, and then leave you. You studied so many years for what? I damn well thought you'd enjoy life for me, a very beautiful life. I was wrong. You're just a complete idiot.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:45:00] Vomero | I saw myself putting down the receiver as if it were hot. I thought to myself, this is a sign of jealousy, she is jealous, she hates me, yes, that's the truth.\n[1976-10-18 10:46:00] Vomero | I thought of those extremely long seconds, I had never before remembered the mother of the Solara brothers, her lifeless body, which had vanished from my mind.\n[1976-10-18 10:47:00] Vomero | At this moment, the only thing that made me uneasy was: why hadn't Nino called? Could it be that, after I told Lina everything, he had stepped back, making me look utterly ridiculous?\n[1976-10-18 10:48:00] New Home | I thought of that moment, of how I must have appeared in her eyes: my insignificant life, ruined over something not worth it.\n[1976-10-18 10:50:00] New Home | I saw the phone ringing at that moment. I sat there staring at the telephone, letting it ring for two or three rings, which felt extremely long.\n[1976-10-18 10:51:00] Vomero | I saw myself grabbing the receiver. I thought about what I was going to say to Lina: \"You never once thought about me. About Nino, you have no right to say anything. Let me make my own mistakes. It's none of your business.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:52:00] New Home | I saw it was not her calling, but Nino. When I heard his voice, I was so happy I could hardly speak coherently.\n[1976-10-18 10:55:00] Vomero | I told him about Pietro and the two daughters, I said to him. I heard, \"We can't reach an agreement in a calm and rational way.\"\n[1976-10-18 10:56:00] Vomero | I saw what I said to him. I heard, \"I've already packed my things. I can't wait to hold you in my arms.\"\n[1976-10-18 11:00:00] Vomero | I saw him tell me about the fierce argument he had with his wife, the last few hours being the most unbearable, and he muttered something. I heard, \"Although I'm very afraid, I can't imagine a life without you.\"\n[1976-10-19 09:00:00] Vomero | I saw that the next day, Pietro went to university, so I asked the neighbor to take care of Dede and Elsa for a few hours.\n[1976-10-19 09:10:00] Vomero | I saw myself placing the letter I had written on the kitchen table, then leaving.\n[1976-10-19 09:15:00] Mercato | I thought to myself, I am doing something extraordinary. I have overturned the old, clichéd way of life. I am part of the wave that breaks up families.\n[1976-10-19 14:00:00] Porto | I saw myself meeting Nino at Rome, and we met at a hotel not far from the train station.\n[1976-10-19 14:30:00] Porto | I saw myself embracing him. I thought to myself: this passionate body, I will never get used to it, it will keep surprising me—long bones, skin that exudes an intoxicating scent, his strength, his supple body, completely different from Pietro, different from the habits between us.\n[1976-10-20 10:00:00] On the plane | I saw that the next morning, I took my first airplane ride in my life. I didn't know how to fasten the seatbelt, so Nino helped me with it.\n[1976-10-20 10:15:00] On the plane | I saw the plane rising with a roaring sound, and I tightly grasped his hand. I thought about how excited I was at that time!\n[1976-10-20 10:20:00] On the plane | I saw the plane suddenly take off, leaving the ground behind. It kept rising until it finally began to fly forward.\n[1976-10-20 10:25:00] On the plane | I saw the houses below turn into rectangular prisms, the roads into lines, the fields into a patch of green, the sea like a thin board tilted sideways, and the clouds flowing downward like an avalanche.\n[1976-10-20 10:30:00] On the plane | I thought of those pains and anxieties, as well as the happiness, all blending together into something very bright. I felt myself flying, and everything became easy.\n[1976-10-20 10:35:00] On the plane | I saw myself sighing. I thought about wanting to completely forget myself.\n[1976-10-20 10:40:00] On the plane | I sometimes asked Nino. I heard, \"Are you happy?\"\n[1976-10-20 10:45:00] On the plane | I saw him nod, and he [intimate act] with me.\n[1976-10-20 10:50:00] On the plane | I thought about how I had intermittently felt that the floor beneath me—the only floor I could step on—was trembling.\n[1980-11-15 22:00:00] Unknown | I heard her describe in detail what had happened to her, and for the first time she used the phrase \"the boundary disappeared.\" I know that it was only years later, on a night in November 1980—by then we were both thirty-six, married with children.\n[1980-11-15 22:05:00] Unknown | I heard Lina say, when she was telling the story, that the feeling was \"the boundary disappeared.\" I knew that time she felt it very clearly, but it wasn't the first time.\n[1980-11-15 22:05:10] Unknown | I know, for example, that she often had a feeling that, in less than a second, a person, an object, a number, or a syllable would break through the original boundaries and change shape.\n[1980-11-15 22:05:20] Unknown | I know that day her father threw her out of the window, and as she flew toward the road, she clearly felt she saw some small red animals, very friendly.\n[1980-11-15 22:05:30] Unknown | I know they have softened the hard pavement, making it smooth and pliable.\n[2005-12-15 08:00:00] Castel dell'Ovo | I saw us walking along the main road early in the morning. I know the last time I saw Lina was five years ago, in the winter of 2005.\n[2005-12-15 08:00:10] Chiaia | I saw that I was the only one speaking. I thought that for many years, we have not been able to find that sense of ease together.\n[2005-12-15 08:00:20] Chiaia | I saw what I remembered, she was humming something and greeting others. I saw them, but those people didn't respond at all.\n[2005-12-15 08:00:30] Chiaia | I saw that sometimes she would interrupt me with short exclamations. I thought that what she said and what I said had nothing to do with each other.\n[2005-12-15 08:00:40] Chiaia | I know that during those years, many bad things happened, some of them were very frightening. I thought that if we wanted to regain the intimacy we once had, we had to speak our innermost secrets.\n[2005-12-15 08:00:50] Chiaia | I thought about it but didn't have the strength to speak, yet she had the energy to talk. But she didn't want to, I guess because she thought it wouldn't make any difference.\n[2005-12-15 08:01:00] Castel dell'Ovo | I always try to find some time to see her whenever I go to San Gregorio Armeno. I thought that no matter what, I still loved her, although I have to say, I was a little afraid of her.\n[2005-12-15 08:01:10] Chiaia | I saw myself getting fatter and fatter, constantly fighting against my own weight. I saw that both of us had grown old, and she had changed a lot—she was always thin to the point of being skeletal.\n[2005-12-15 08:01:20] Castel dell'Ovo | I saw her with short hair, which she had cut herself, and her hair was already white. I know she didn't do it on purpose, but she just didn't care.",

I thought about it and felt as if I would split the buildings, the streets, the passersby, and even myself in two.\n[2005-12-15 08:02:00] School gate | I saw us reach the elementary school gate when a young man I didn't know rushed past us, out of breath. I heard him shouting to her, \"There's a female corpse in the flower bed next to the church.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:02:10] Small Garden | I saw us quicken our steps and head toward the small garden. Lina pulled me to the edge of the crowd and rudely pushed her way in.\n[2005-12-15 08:02:20] Small Garden | I saw the woman lying on her side, very fat, wearing a deep green, outdated raincoat.\n[2005-12-15 08:02:30] Small Garden | I saw Lina and immediately recognized her. I knew she was our childhood friend—Giovanna Spagnuolo, Michele's ex-wife—but I didn't recognize her.\n[2005-12-15 08:02:40] Small Garden | I saw her beautiful face was ruined, her ankles had become very swollen. I know I haven't seen Giggia in decades.\n[2005-12-15 08:02:50] Small Garden | I saw that her hair was once black, but now it's fiery red. It was still the same length as when she was a girl, but very thin, spreading out on the loose soil.\n[2005-12-15 08:03:00] Small Garden | I saw that she had only one shoe on, a low-heeled and very old one; the other foot was wearing just a gray wool sock, with the big toe torn open.\n[2005-12-15 08:03:10] Small Garden | I saw her other shoe a meter away. I thought about it and felt as if, when she tried to kick away her pain and fear, her shoes had slipped off her feet.\n[2005-12-15 08:03:20] Small Garden | I saw myself, and I couldn't help but let out a loud cry. I saw Lina looking at me with annoyance.\n[2005-12-15 08:03:30] Bench by the flower bed | I saw us sitting on a bench not far from the flower bed, silently waiting for someone to carry away Giacomo.\n[2005-12-15 08:03:40] Bench by the flower bed | What happened? How did she die? We didn't know at the time.\n[2005-12-15 08:04:30] Lina's house (old house) | I saw us going to Lina's house, the old house where Lina's parents used to live. I know the house is small, and she lives there with her son Rino.\n[2005-12-15 08:05:00] Lina's house (old house) | I saw that Giggia was a mutual friend, and we talked about her. I heard Lina talking about Geyola's life, her fanciful dreams and her sinister character—nothing good to say, in short.\n[2005-12-15 08:05:30] Lina's House (Old House) | The image that appeared in my mind was the profile of someone lying on the ground, along with their thin, sparse hair, revealing the white skin of Giòla's skull. I was thinking, but at that moment I couldn't focus on what she was saying.\n[2005-12-15 08:06:00] Lina's house (old house) | I thought about how many of our childhood playmates are already gone from this world. They disappear sometimes because of illness, sometimes because their nerves couldn't stand the trials of life, or sometimes because someone drained their blood.\n[2005-12-15 08:06:30] Lina's kitchen | I saw that we had been in the kitchen for a while, and in the end we didn't clean the dishes and went out again. I thought we were both a bit tired and didn't want to clear the table.\n[2005-12-15 08:07:00] Spaccanapoli | I saw that it was a clear winter day, and the sunlight made everything look fresh. I thought that I felt this Mergellina was different from us. We have grown old, but it has kept its original appearance.\n[2005-12-15 08:07:30] Spaccanapoli | I saw the low, gray houses still standing, the courtyard where we played games as children, the main road, the pitch-black entrance of Mercato, and the violence there—everything was the same.\n[2005-12-15 08:08:00] Around Mergellina | I saw that the scenery around Mask Loc 002 had changed. The greenish ponds that were there before were gone, and the old factory of the canning plant had also disappeared.\n[2005-12-15 08:08:30] Around Mergellina | I saw that some skyscrapers with gleaming glass facades had been built in those places. I thought that this symbolized the brilliant future we had never believed in before.\n[2005-12-15 08:09:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how, in the past years, I had recorded all the changes of Mergellina, sometimes with curiosity, sometimes carelessly.\n[2005-12-15 08:09:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I know, for example, the skyscraper at the train station, which once impressed me a lot decades ago, with its layers rising higher and higher. I thought back to when I was a child, imagining that beyond our Mergellina, there were some incredibly magical places; back then, next to the train station, the framework of this building seemed extremely tall to us.\n[2005-12-15 08:10:00] Via Garibaldi (Memories) | I remember how, back then, my friends and I would walk toward the sea, along the edge of the wealthy district. Whenever we passed through Garibaldi Street, I would always be surprised and say something to the people beside me. I said to Lina, Pinocchia, Pasquale, Pinocchia, and Antonio, \"Look, how tall this building is!\"\n[2005-12-15 08:10:30] Corso Garibaldi (Memories) | I thought, I wondered, that building upstairs must be inhabited by angels, who would surely appreciate the view of the entire city. If I could climb to the top of that building, I would be very happy.\n[2005-12-15 08:11:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I know that even though it's not in our Mergellina, it was our skyscraper, the one we watched rise day by day, but later the building was put on hold. I thought that when I returned home from Borgo, I felt that the building at the train station was no longer a symbol of the city's rapid development, but rather a nest of inefficiency and incompetence.\n[2005-12-15 08:11:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that during that time, I felt w eMergellina an dSan Gregorio Armeno othe rMergellina were no different from each other, evil spread from ou rMergellina to the entir eSan Gregorio Armeno, and no place was spared.\n[2005-12-15 08:12:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw cold and heat, especially the unbearable rain. I always think that every time I return to San Gregorio Armeno, this city feels like a pool of mud, unable to withstand the change of seasons.\n[2005-12-15 08:12:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw either the Garibaldi Square flooded, or the corridor in front of the museum collapsed, or maybe there was a landslide somewhere, and there was a constant power outage.\n[2005-12-15 08:13:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought of those dark, dangerous streets, which have always remained in my memory.\n[2005-12-15 08:13:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw the traffic getting increasingly chaotic, with potholes on the road and large puddles that were hard to cross. Sewage was gushing out of the drains and flowing everywhere.\n[2005-12-15 08:14:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that the mountain was covered with newly built houses, all very shaky. Dirty water, garbage, and bacteria flowed into the sea, corroding the underground world.\n[2005-12-15 08:14:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I know that people die because they are not favored, because of corruption and oppression, but every time there is an election, they still enthusiastically support the politicians who make their lives unbearable.\n[2005-12-15 08:15:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw myself getting off the train and returning to the place where I had once lived, all the while speaking the dialect, being careful and cautious. I thought as if saying: I'm with you, don't hurt me.\n[2005-12-15 08:15:30] Piazza del Plebiscito | I know that when I graduated from university, I wrote a novel in one go. To my surprise, within just a few months, this novel became a book. I thought about the world where I was born, and the more I thought about it, the worse it seemed to me.\n[2005-12-15 08:16:00] Piazza del Plebiscito | I thought that at this point, in Borgo or Porto, I was living well, and sometimes even felt happy; but in my city, every time I went home, I worried something might happen that would prevent me from escaping. I was afraid of losing the things I had finally managed to get.\n[2005-12-15 08:16:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how I was afraid I'd never see Pietro again, the man I was about to marry, and terrified of being excluded from the clean, orderly publishing house, of never again coming into contact with the refined Adele Airota—my future mother-in-law, who was more like a mother to me than my own.",

    "text": "[2005-12-15 08:17:00] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I saw the Garibaldi Square, Forcella Street, Duke Street, and the Raffaello and Rettifilo districts, all crowded with people. I know that in the past, San Gregorio Armeno was already very crowded.\n[2005-12-15 08:17:30] Street of San Gregorio Armeno | I thought back to the late 1960s, when I felt the crowds growing more and more dense, more brutal and uncontrollable, unbearable.\n[2005-12-15 08:18:00] Mai Zuo Kao Nai Street (Memories) | I remember one morning I walked all the way along Via Mazzini. I know that a few years ago, I worked as a salesperson in a bookstore on that street.\n[2005-12-15 08:18:30] Mazokannon Street (Memories) | I thought about going there purely out of curiosity, I wanted to see how the place where I'd suffered was doing now, especially so I could catch a glimpse of the university there—I had never even set foot in that university.\n[2005-12-15 08:19:00] Mazokannon Street (Memories) | I thought about comparing it with the Higher Normal School at Borgo, and I even hoped to meet a few of Galiani's children—Nadia and Nadia—so I could show them off.\n[2005-12-15 08:19:30] University Campus (Memories) | I saw that there were a lot of San Gregorio Armeno locals and students from all over the south, all dressed well, very confident, making a lot of noise, acting somewhat reckless on one hand, yet also somewhat shy. I think of that street and the university campus, and both make me anxious.\n[2005-12-15 08:20:00] University Campus (Memories) | I saw them all crowded at the classroom door or inside the classroom, and a long line often formed in front of the secretariat; conflicts kept arising between them.\n[2005-12-15 08:20:30] University Campus (Memories) | I saw three or four students fighting just a few steps away from me. They started fighting over nothing, beginning with insults and then moving on to punching and kicking each other. I saw all the boys were hot-tempered, shouting at each other in a dialect I could hardly understand.\n[2005-12-15 08:21:00] University Campus (Memories) | I saw that I was about to leave. I thought earlier that it was a safe, rational place, but now it seems to have become a threatening one.\n[2005-12-15 08:21:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought, in any case, that San Gregorio Armeno was getting worse and worse.\n[2005-12-15 08:22:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that after the rainy season began, the city once again collapsed. A building crumbled in the middle, as if a person had leaned on a sofa arm that had been eaten through by termites; when the arm gave way, many people were killed or injured.\n[2005-12-15 08:22:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw the following were cries, fights, and fierce arguments in the newspapers.\n[2005-12-15 08:23:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought that the city's inner self was filled with an unrelenting rage, churning and surging within, its surface erupting with pus-filled sores, while inside it was riddled with poison.\n[2005-12-15 08:23:30] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought about how she hated everyone: children, adults, the elderly, people from other cities, American soldiers from NATO, tourists from any country, and the San Gregorio Armeno people.\n[2005-12-15 08:24:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I saw that everywhere, in the suburbs, in the city center, on the small hills beneath Mount Vesuvius, it was all the same. I wondered how they could stand this chaos, this dangerous place?\n[2005-12-15 08:24:30] Stazione Centrale | I know the impression of Stazione Centrale was terrible, as well as the journey there, Lina's factory where she worked, Lina herself—her son and the run-down house they lived in, and how she lived with Enzo but hadn't yet slept with him. I thought about all this and it made me feel terrible!\n[2005-12-15 08:25:00] Lina's house | I saw her wanting to help him. I heard Lina say that Enzo wants to learn how to operate the electronic IBM System.\n[2005-12-15 08:25:30] Lina's house | I saw her pretending to be knowledgeable, mentioning some institutions and their abbreviations: Porto National IBM System Research Center (CCSM), and the IBM System Applied to Social Sciences Soviet Research Center (CSACSS). I thought of her voice, deeply etched into my mind, the way she tried to hide the ugly Stazione Centrale, the smell of sausages, the factory odor, and her situation.\n[2005-12-15 08:26:00] Lina's house | I thought she wanted me to believe that a research center like this would soon also be established in San Gregorio Armeno.\n[2005-12-15 08:26:30] Lina's house | I thought to myself at that time: Maybe in Porto there was a chance, perhaps in the Soviet Union there was, but not here! This is just an uncontrollable fantasy in your mind. Now you even want to drag down the poor, loyal Enzo.\n[2005-12-15 08:27:00] San Gregorio Armeno | I thought of my goal: to leave this place! To get completely away from here! To escape forever the life we've lived since birth, and to take root in a place where everything is possible and orderly. And I believed I had already won.\n[2005-12-15 08:27:30] Unknown Location (Summary of Memories) | I know that things in this world are all connected, each part nested within a larger one: from Mergellina to the entire city, from the city to all of Italy, from Italy to all of Europe, and from Europe to the entire planet. I thought so, but in the following decades, I found out I was wrong!\n[2005-12-15 08:28:00] Unknown Location (Recollection Summary) | I think now that this is how I see it: it's not that our Mergellina is sick, nor is it only San Gregorio Armeno that's like this. It's the whole earth, the whole universe, or rather, all universes are the same. A person's power lies in their ability to hide and cover up the truth.\n[2005-12-15 08:28:30] Lina's house | I saw the winter of 2005, that afternoon, when I talked about these things with Lina. I thought of myself speaking with a resolute tone, as if delivering a harsh condemnation.\n[2005-12-15 08:29:00] Lina's house | I thought of telling her that she had actually known this all along, but she had never left San Gregorio Armeno.\n[2005-12-15 08:29:30] Lina's house | I thought about it, but I immediately felt ashamed because from my own tone, I heard the unbearable bitterness of an old woman, and I knew she hated the way I was speaking.\n[2005-12-15 08:30:00] Lina's house | I saw later, she really did smile at me, showing her aged, worn teeth, and made a nervous expression. I heard her say, \"You're playing the wise one, trying to reveal the truth? What's your intention? Are you going to write about us? Are you going to write about me?\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:10] Lina's house | I heard \"No.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:15] Lina's house | I heard, \"Just tell the truth!\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"That's too complicated.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:25] Lina's house | I heard, \"You've already thought it over, haven't you? Are you still thinking about it?\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:30] Lina's house | I heard, \"A little.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:35] Lina's house | \"I heard, 'You have to let me go, Elena! You have to let all of us go. We don't matter, we should disappear, Giggia and me, everyone doesn't matter.'\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:40] Lina's house | I heard, \"This isn't real.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:45] Lina's House | I saw her make a discontented face, she squinted her eyes, scrutinizing me with her pupils, her lips half-closed. I saw what I thought was a very ugly expression.\n[2005-12-15 08:30:50] Lina's house | \"I heard her say, 'Okay, if you really want to write, go ahead. Write about Giggia, write about whoever you want, but don't write about me. You have to promise me, if you dare to write about me...\"\n[2005-12-15 08:30:55] Lina's house | I heard, \"I don't write about anyone, not even you.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:00] Lina's house | I heard, \"You'd better be careful, I'm watching you.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:05] Lina's house | I heard, \"Is that so?\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:10] Lina's house | I heard, \"I'll get into your computer, look at your files, and delete them.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:15] Lina's house | I heard \"Forget it!\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:20] Lina's house | I heard, \"Do you think I can't do it?\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:25] Lina's house | I heard, \"I know you can do it, but I'll protect myself.\"\n[2005-12-15 08:31:30] Lina's house | I saw her smile again, still as evil as before.\n[2005-12-15 08:31:35] Lina's house | I heard, \"But you can't stop me.\"",

    "text": "[2010-05-20 10:00:00] In front of the desk | I had been writing for several weeks, and I hadn't wasted time rereading what I'd written. I kept thinking about the last thing she said, the final words she spoke to me: \"But you can't stop me.\" I felt great.\n[2010-05-20 10:00:30] In front of the desk | I watched as I drank my coffee, observing the Po River's current striking the pillars of the Princess Isabella Bridge.\n[2010-05-20 10:01:00] In front of the desk | I thought, if Lina were still alive—she would certainly have couldn't resist sneaking into my computer, and she would see what I've written.\n[2010-05-20 10:01:30] In front of the desk | I thought of that crazy old woman, who would surely get angry because I didn't obey her. She would interfere, revise things, add her own elements, and forget her obsession with \"vanishing from the face of the earth.\"\n[2010-05-20 10:02:00] In front of the desk | I finished my coffee, washed the cup, and returned to my desk, resuming my writing. I continued from that cold spring in Porto.\n[2010-11-01 09:00:00] at home | I saw that I had received a call from Rino. I heard Rino tell me that his mother had gone missing. I had thought he was going to ask me for money again and had already prepared to refuse him, but then I realized he was calling for another reason.\n[2010-11-01 09:00:10] at home | I heard myself ask, \"When did it happen?\"\n[2010-11-01 09:00:15] at home 007 | I heard him answer, \"Two weeks ago.\"\n[2010-11-01 09:00:20] at home | I heard him trying to object, explaining in Italian mixed with the San Gregorio Armeno dialect. I heard myself asking him, \"So you're only calling me now?\" I heard him say he was sure Mother was just wandering around in San Gregorio Armeno city as usual. I thought about how, even though I wasn't angry, the sarcasm in my tone must have made him feel hostile. I found his explanation clumsy and embarrassing.\n[2010-11-01 09:00:30] at home | I heard myself ask, \"Won't you go back in the evening?\"\n[2010-11-01 09:00:35] at home 007 | I heard him say, \"You know her.\"\n[2010-11-01 09:00:40] at home | I heard myself say, \"I know, but not coming home for two weeks, do you think that's normal?\"\n[2010-11-01 09:00:50] at home 007 | I heard him admit, \"It's abnormal. Elena, you haven't seen her in a while, her condition is worse: she never sleeps, goes out of the house, does whatever she wants, comes back whenever she feels like.\" I thought to myself that, no matter what, he had started to worry.\n[2010-11-01 09:01:00] at home | I know he asked everyone, went to all the hospitals, even went to Labor Office, but there was still no news. I thought to myself, sarcastically: What a fine son! A strong man in his forties, who's never had a proper job, spending each day cheating, swindling, and wasting time. I can just imagine how devoted he is to his mother. I think it's all nonsense—he's got no brain, only himself in his mind.\n[2010-11-01 09:01:10] at home | I heard him suddenly ask me, \"She's not with you, is she?\" I know I remember him coming to my house more than ten times, but I also know his mother never left San Gregorio Armeno her whole life. I thought to myself: His mother is in Turin? He knows the situation well, he's just talking. I felt he himself likes traveling, I didn't invite him, his mother was the one I warmly welcomed.\n[2010-11-01 09:01:20] at home | I saw and replied. I heard myself say, \"No, she's not here.\"\n[2010-11-01 09:01:25] at home | I heard him ask, \"Are you sure?\"\n[2010-11-01 09:01:30] at home | I heard myself say, \"Rino, don't do this. I told you, she's not here.\"\n[2010-11-01 09:01:35] at home | I heard him ask, \"Where did she go?\"\n[2010-11-01 09:01:40] at home | I saw myself waiting with patience. I heard him crying on the other end of the phone, first pretending to sob, then finally breaking down into real tears. I thought about how I decided to let him reveal all the despair and pain.\n[2010-11-01 09:02:10] at home | I waited until he finished crying, then I spoke to him. I heard myself say, \"Please. This time, you have to do it her way: don't look for her anymore.\"\n[2010-11-01 09:02:15] at home | I heard him ask, \"What do you mean?\"\n[2010-11-01 09:02:20] at home | I said that and then hung up. I heard myself say, \"That's exactly what I told you just now. It's no use looking for her. You have to learn to live on your own. And don't call me again.\"\n[2010-11-01 09:05:00] at home | I know Rino's mother's name is Lina Lina, everyone calls her Lina, but I've called her Lina for over sixty years. I still remember, more than thirty years ago, she told me she wanted to disappear without leaving any trace. I thought to myself: if I suddenly called her Lina or Lila, she would feel that our friendship had come to an end. I knew she wasn't trying to escape, change her identity, or [the tragic event] (because she didn't want Rino to deal with the body), but rather to vanish completely from this world. Because I know her, I felt she must have found a way to disappear entirely.\n[2010-11-15 10:00:00] at home | I watched the days go by, checking my email and the mailbox, and I often wrote her letters. I saw that I had received no message, and she almost never replied. I knew this was her habit; she preferred to call or talk all night.\n[2010-11-15 10:15:00] at home | I saw myself opening the drawer and rummaging through the metal box where I kept various trinkets. I saw that I had found nothing related to her, no photo, no note, nor any small gift. I know I had thrown away many things before, especially those related to her, and she knows that too. I was surprised that I hadn't found anything about myself. I was thinking, had she left me nothing at all these years? Or even worse, did I not want to keep anything related to her? I felt that was very likely.\n[2010-11-15 20:00:00] at home 007 | I called Rino, whom I really didn't want to talk to. That evening, he called back. I heard him say, \"I saw you made a call. Did you get any message?\" I replied, \"No, did you?\" He answered, \"No.\" I thought about how I felt his tone of voice had an intention to make me sad. I felt his words were incoherent.\n[2010-11-15 20:02:00] at home | I saw I was listening patiently. I heard him say he wanted to appear on a missing persons TV show, to make a statement through the television station to seek his mother's forgiveness. I then asked him, \"Have you looked in her wardrobe?\" I thought to myself, the most obvious thing, he hadn't even thought of it.\n[2010-11-15 20:02:10] at home | I heard him ask, \"What are you looking at the wardrobe for?\" I said, \"Go check quickly.\"\n[2010-11-15 20:10:00] at home 007 | I saw him searching all over the house. I heard from him that there was nothing in the wardrobe, no clothes, just old hangers left. Shoes, books, photos, VCDs, computers and other items had all disappeared. I heard Rino's voice, full of surprise. I knew she was a computer expert, having started using computers in the late 1960s.\n[2010-11-15 20:15:00] at home | I heard myself say to him, \"Take your time looking. When you find it, call me and see if we can find something that belongs to her, even if it's just a hairpin.\"\n[2010-11-16 09:00:00] at home | I saw that the next day I received his call. I heard him say, excitedly, \"I didn't find anything.\" I asked, \"Nothing at all?\" He replied, \"Nothing. She cut herself out of the group photo, including the one of me with her when I was a child.\"\n[2010-11-16 09:00:30] at home | I heard myself ask, \"Did you look carefully?\" He answered, \"I searched the whole house.\" I pressed, \"Did you check the basement?\" He replied, \"I just said, I looked everywhere.\"\n[2010-11-16 09:01:00] at home | I heard him say, \"The box with the documents is also missing. I know it had the birth certificate, the phone contract, and the utility bills. What's going on? Did someone steal everything? What are they looking for? What do they want from me and my mom?\"\n[2010-11-16 09:02:00] at home | I saw myself comforting him, letting him rest easy. I heard myself say that it was completely impossible for anyone to get anything from him. I heard him ask, \"Can I stay with you for a while?\" I answered, \"No.\" He begged, \"Please, I can't sleep at night.\" I said, \"That's your problem, Rino, I can't do anything about it.\"\n[2010-11-16 09:03:00] at home | I hung up the phone, and later he called again, but I didn't answer. I sat at the table.\n[2010-11-16 09:05:00] at home | I know she is now sixty-six. I thought to myself that this time, Lina was once again going too far, just like before. I realized she had exaggerated the significance of the \"traces\" in the whole picture. She didn't just want to disappear herself, but also wanted to completely erase everything from her past life. I felt extremely angry.\n[2010-11-16 09:10:00] at home | I saw myself opening the computer and starting to write our story. I thought to myself, let's see, who will win this time. I decided to write down every detail, everything I could remember.",
