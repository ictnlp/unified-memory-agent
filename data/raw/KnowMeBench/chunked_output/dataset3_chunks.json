    "text": "[1896-12-21 00:42:47] At home | I saw that they were discussing inviting Paul for the first time to have dinner at home. I heard Robert say that unfortunately Professor Goedel was currently away on a trip, and she herself had completely cut off contact with Matthew, otherwise these two guests would have interested the outgoing ambassador.\n[1896-12-21 00:42:52] At home | I heard James answer that guests of honor such as Professor Gaudier, a distinguished scholar, would greatly enhance the table.\n[1896-12-21 00:42:57] At home | I heard that \"Matthew, who loved to show off and was desperate for others to know he had made contact with high-ranking officials, was actually a vulgar fake, and de Paul would use the word 'disgusting' to descri be Matthew.\"\n[1896-12-21 01:13:02] Home | I thought I needed to explain Steven's answer to James a bit.\n[1896-12-21 01:13:07] Home | I know some people may still remember that Professor Goedal was once quite unremarkable, and that Matthew was both modest and tactful in social situations, always refined and proper.\n[1896-12-21 01:13:27] At home | I knew that Matthew, the old friend of Steven's parents, had acquired another new title (and it would not be his last) besides \"Little Matthew\" and \"Matthew of the The Union\"—that of John's husband.\n[1896-12-21 01:13:47] Home | I know that he had subjected his usual instincts, desires, and wit to the vulgar ambitions of that woman, striving to establish a new status suitable for his companion, a status that both of them shared, and which was greatly below his former standing.\n[1896-12-21 01:14:07] At home | I thought that, therefore, Steven felt as if he were a different person.\n[1896-12-21 01:14:12] Home | I knew that since he had begun this second life (although he still continued to meet his friends individually; he was unwilling to impose John on them, provided they did not themselves ask to meet her), a life shared with his wife, one that existed among his new acquaintances.\n[1896-12-21 01:14:32] Home | I now understand it easily: in order to measure the status of these new friends, that is to say, the pleasure their visits brought to his self-esteem, he used as a standard not the most outstanding figures from his pre-marital social circle, but rather John's former friends.\n[1896-12-21 01:14:37] Home | I know that, however, even when people knew he liked associating with vulgar officials and the vases at government balls—women of ill repute.\n[1896-12-21 01:14:57] At home | I was surprised that he actually took pleasure in boasting that the wife of a certain office deputy had once visited John.\n[1896-12-21 01:15:02] At home | I knew because he had once (and still did) gracefully remained silent in the face of invitations to Twickenham or Buckingham Palace.\n[1896-12-21 01:15:22] At home | I thought that perhaps people saw the simplicity of the once dashing Matthew as just a refined form of vanity.\n[1896-12-21 01:15:27] At home | I thought that perhaps they considered Steven's old friend Paul, like certain Jews, to be alternately displaying the states his race had continuously undergone, from the most unembarrassed affectation to the most naked brutality, all the way to the most refined politeness.\n[1896-12-21 01:15:32] At home | I thought, but the main reason—and this generally applies to human beings—is that the virtues of Stevenes are not always some kind of floating thing that is at the mercy of Stevenes.\n[1896-12-21 01:15:37] Home | I thought that in Steven's mind, virtue was closely linked to the actions he believed one should take to practice virtue. Therefore, when another type of activity arose, Steven was at a loss and never even considered that the same virtue could be practiced in this activity as well.\n[1896-12-21 01:15:42] Home | I knew that Matthew was extremely attentive to his new acquaintances, eagerly listing their names with great enthusiasm.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:02] Home | I thought of this attitude, which was similar to that of great artists who are humble or generous: in their later years, they might try cooking or gardening, taking pride in their favorite dishes or flower beds, and they would only accept praise, not criticism.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:07] Home | I thought that, once their own masterpieces were involved, they were willing to listen to criticism; or rather, they could generously give away a famous painting, but would be thoroughly upset if they lost forty sous at a game of dominoes.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:12] Home | I knew that when it came to Professor Goald, the Marceaux would have long reunions with him again, much later, at the Palais de Raspail, at Madame Verdurin's.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:32] Home | I thought at that moment, regarding him, it was first of all necessary to draw attention to one point.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:37] Home | I thought that Matthew's change, strictly speaking, could not have surprised Steven, because when Steven saw Michael's father on the Champs-Élysées, the change had already been completed, though it had not yet been perceived by Steven.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:42] Home | I thought about how he hadn't spoken to Steven at that time, so he couldn't have boasted to Steven about his political friends (and even if he had, Steven probably wouldn't have immediately detected his vanity).\n[1896-12-21 01:16:47] Home | I thought of how the long-standing preconceptions about a person could make the Stevenes turn a blind eye and deaf ear to him.\n[1896-12-21 01:16:52] Home | I knew Robert was the same; for three years, she hadn't noticed the lipstick on her niece's lips, as if it had dissolved into the fluid and vanished completely.\n[1896-12-21 01:17:12] Home | I knew that one day, the overpowering lipstick or some other reason caused what is called a supersaturated phenomenon, and then the lipstick that had previously gone unnoticed crystallized.\n[1896-12-21 01:17:32] At home | I knew that Robert, suddenly seeing a burst of color, would exclaim it was shameful, just as she had in Sunrise, and almost cut off all contact with her niece.\n[1896-12-21 01:17:52] Home | I know the opposite about Professor Goedal; the period when he witnessed Matthew entering the social world had already been very distant, and the passage of time had brought him honor and titles.\n[1896-12-21 01:18:12] Home | I thought that, in the first place, a person can lack cultural refinement, can indulge in silly homophonic word games, yet still possess a special talent that no cultural refinement can replace, such as the talent of a great strategist or an outstanding physician.\n[1896-12-21 01:18:17] Home | I knew that, in the eyes of his colleagues, Professor Godard was not merely an obscure nobody who had finally become a renowned physician throughout Europe.\n[1896-12-21 01:18:37] Home | I knew that the top young doctors had declared— at least for a few years, since standards, once created to meet changing needs, were themselves in constant change—that if they ever fell ill, Professor Godard was the only one they could entrust their lives to.\n[1896-12-21 01:18:57] Home | I knew they certainly wanted to associate with certain head physicians who had deeper cultural refinement and stronger artistic sensibilities, discussing Unknown_Nietzsche and Unknown_Wagner with them.\n[1896-12-21 01:19:17] Home | I know that Madame Godard receives her husband's colleagues and students, hoping that one day her husband will become the dean of the medical school.\n[1896-12-21 01:19:37] Home | I knew that people at the party appreciated the music, but Professor Godard had no interest in listening; instead, he went to the next living room to play cards.\n[1896-12-21 01:19:57] Home | I thought of his remarkable eyesight, his swift, profound, and accurate diagnosis, which was truly admirable.\n[1896-12-21 01:20:02] Home | I was thinking about the third point, regarding the tone and attitude that Professor Goedal adopts towards people of James's type, and it should be noted:\n[1896-12-21 01:20:07] Home | I thought that the essential nature of the Stevenes in the second part of life might be a development or decline, an expansion or weakening of the first essence, but not always. Sometimes it was the opposite nature, a genuine opposite.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:02] Home | I knew that during his youth, Professor Goedel's hesitant expression, excessive shyness, and kindness often made him the target of mockery, except in the Verdurin family, who were infatuated with him.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:07] Home | I wondered which compassionate friend had advised him to adopt a cold expression, which was easily done given his important position.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:12] Home | I knew that at the Verdurins' he would naturally revert to his true self, but elsewhere he would remain cold and distant, often saying nothing at all.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:17] Home | I knew that when he was forced to speak, he often took a blunt tone, deliberately making people uncomfortable.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:22] Home | I knew he applied this new attitude to his patients, since they had never met him before and therefore could not make comparisons.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:27] Home | I thought they would be greatly surprised to learn that Professor Gaudet was not by nature rude.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:32] Home | I knew that Professor Goard was making every effort to keep his face expressionless.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:37] Home | I knew that when he was on duty at the hospital, he would tell puns that made everyone— from the chief physician to the new interns—laugh heartily, while his facial muscles remained completely still.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:42] Home | I knew that because he had shaved off his mustache, his face had completely changed.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:47] Home | I know I should finally say something about M. de Paul. Before the war, he had been an ambassador. During the crisis on May 16th, he was still an ambassador.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:52] Home | I know that, to the great surprise of many, he later undertook several important missions on behalf of France, even going to Egypt as a debt supervisor, where he demonstrated his extraordinary financial abilities and achieved notable success. These missions were entrusted to him by the radical government.\n[1896-12-22 00:40:57] Home | I knew that ordinary reactionaries generally refused to serve in this cabinet, and Paul was even less likely to do so: his background, social connections, and views were enough to make him a suspect in the eyes of the cabinet.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:02] Home | I knew, however, that the radical ministers seemed to realize that this appointment could show their openness of mind, their devotion to the highest interests of France, and their difference from ordinary politicians, thereby justifying the \"Journal des Débats\" labeling them as men of state.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:07] Home | I knew that in the end, they would benefit from the prestige of noble family names and the attention generated by the unexpected appointments.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:12] Home | I knew they understood that employing Paul was entirely to their advantage, and they had no reason to fear he would betray his political loyalty, because the marquis's background did not arouse their suspicion at all, but rather gave them reassurance.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:17] Home | I thought that the republican government had not been wrong in this regard.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:22] Home | I know this because certain aristocrats, from childhood on, have considered noble surnames as an intrinsic advantage that never fades (their peers, or those of even higher birth, were well aware of the value of such an advantage).\n[1896-12-22 00:41:27] Home | I knew that they were well aware that they didn't have to go to the trouble, as so many bourgeois people did, of expressing opinions (though with no real effect) and cultivating the company of upright gentlemen, since such efforts would add no prestige to them.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:32] Home | I know that, on the contrary, they would do everything possible to raise their own status in the eyes of a noble or someone like Samuel, and to achieve this, they had to add things to their family name that they hadn't had before: political influence, literary or artistic reputation, or great wealth.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:37] Home | I knew they had no intention of wasting their time on the useless gentry that bourgeois people pursued, and besides, gaining the ineffectual friendship of a country gentleman would not lead to the gratitude of a monarch.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:42] Home | I knew that they devoted a great deal of effort to politicians who could help them secure positions at the embassy or run for office (even Freemasons didn't care about that), to renowned artists or scholars who could help them make \"breakthroughs\" in their own fields, in short, to everyone who would help them gain fame and marry into wealth.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:47] Home | I knew that Paul had absorbed, from his long diplomatic experience, that passive, conventional, and conservative spirit, the so-called \"government spirit,\" which is common to all governments, especially to the various embassies under them.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:52] Home | I know that the diplomat's profession has made him detest, fear, and despise the methods of the opposition—those somewhat revolutionary, at the very least improper, methods.\n[1896-12-22 00:41:57] Home | I thought that only common people and a few ignorant individuals in the social world considered so-called different types to be mere empty talk, but in most cases, the closeness between different types came not from sharing the same views, but from a common spiritual lineage.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:02] Home | I knew that men like Léautre were part of the classical faction, yet he applauded Maximilien Dugan or Méslier's eulogies of Unknown_Victor Hugo, but refused to applaud Cladel's eulogy of Boileau.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:07] Home | I know that the same nationalism brought Baille to close quarters with his voters—who did not distinguish between him and Mr. George Béry—but it could not bring Baille closer to his colleagues at the French Academy, since although they shared his political views, they were spiritually quite different.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:12] Home | I knew that they even disliked him and preferred the opponents, M. Léon Daudet and M. Deschanel; loyal royalists felt close to Léon Daudet and Deschanel, yet distant from Moras and Léon Daudet, although these two men also wished for the restoration of the monarchy.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:17] Home | I knew Paul was taciturn, not only because of his cautious and prudent professional habits, but also because, in the eyes of such people, words carried greater value and deeper meaning.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:22] Home | I knew that their decade-long efforts to bring the two countries closer had, in their speeches and agreements, been reduced to nothing more than a simple adjective, which seemed trivial but to them represented an entire world.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:27] Home | I knew that Paul, who was known in the committee for his icy demeanor, was sitting next to James during the meeting, so people began to congratulate James on having won the favor of this former ambassador.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:32] Home | I thought James himself was also surprised, because he was not an easygoing man; apart from a small circle of close friends, he had few contacts with others, and he himself did not hide that fact.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:37] Home | I thought of how he had realized that the diplomat's courtesy was based on a completely independent point of view, decided by himself.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:42] Home | I thought that when someone makes the Stevenes bored or unhappy, his entire spiritual qualities or sensitivity become useless; they are not as effective as another person's straightforward and easygoing manner, which wins the Stevenes' favor, even though that person seems hollow, superficial, and worthless in the eyes of many.\n[1896-12-22 00:42:47] Home | I heard everyone in the committee talking in surprise: \"De Paul has invited Steven to dinner again, that's quite a big deal.\" I knew that he had no contact with anyone in the committee.",

    "text": "[1896-12-22 00:42:52] Home | I heard James say, \"Steven is sure he'll tell Steven another thrilling story about the 1870 war.\"\n[1896-12-22 03:32:02] Home | I knew that James knew Paul was perhaps the only one who had drawn the Emperor's attention to Prussia's military buildup and warlike intentions; I also knew that Unknown_Bismarck had expressed admiration for De Noailles' wisdom.\n[1896-12-23 04:09:49] Home | I know that just recently, at a grand evening event at the opera house for Emperor Theodosius, the press noted that the emperor had held a long audience with Paul.\n[1896-12-23 04:10:09] Home | I heard James, who was interested in foreign policy, say to the Stevenes: \"Steven should find out whether the Emperor's visit is really important. Steven knows that old Paul keeps his mouth shut, but he talks freely with Steven.\"\n[1896-12-23 04:10:14] Home | I thought that, in Robert's eyes, the ambassador himself might lack the kind of intelligence that most interested her.\n[1896-12-23 04:10:19] Home | I knew that Paul's conversation was a complete example of an old form of language specific to a certain profession, a certain social class, a certain period—perhaps not entirely abolished for that profession and social class.\n[1896-12-23 04:10:39] Home | I felt sorry that Steven had not been able to transcri be what he had heard, for then he could have easily created the effect of linguistic old age without any effort.\n[1896-12-23 04:10:44] Home | I know, just like that actor at the Palais-Royal: someone asked him where he found those astonishing hats, and he replied, \"Not found. Preserved.\"\n[1896-12-23 04:11:04] Home | I thought that in short, Steven felt that Robert found Paul a bit \"out of date.\"\n[1896-12-23 04:11:09] Home | I thought that in terms of behavior, he didn't make her unhappy, but in terms of thought—actually Paul's thoughts were very up-to-date—perhaps he was far less attractive than in terms of language, which had no charm at all in her eyes.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:14] Home | I thought that, if she were to praise the diplomat in front of her husband, who had shown such an unusual favor toward him, her husband would secretly feel pleased.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:19] Home | I saw that she confirmed James's favorable opinion of Paul, and at the same time led him to form a favorable opinion of herself. I thought of how she was aware that she was fulfilling her duty: to make her husband happy, just as one would make a dish delicious or keep the servant who brings the food quiet.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:24] Home | I saw that she was bad at lying to James, so I began to cultivate an appreciation for the ambassador in order to sincerely praise him.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:34] Home | I had seen Steven once walk with his tall figure straight as a rod, but when he saw Steven's mother driving by in her carriage, he would immediately throw away the cigar he had just lit and lift his hat in greeting. I thought to myself, after all, she certainly appreciated his kind expression, his somewhat outdated manners (and overly formal).\n[1896-12-23 04:11:39] Home | I thought of how she also appreciated his measured conversation—he avoided talking about himself as much as possible and always sought topics that would please the other person—and the astonishing speed with which he replied.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:44] Home | I saw James had just sent a letter when he received a reply, and I saw the handwriting of Paul on the envelope. I thought his first reaction would be that the two letters had just happened to miss each other.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:49] Home | I wondered if the post office gave him special treatment, staying overtime to receive and send his letters.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:54] Home | I thought of Robert praising him for responding quickly despite his busy schedule, and for being amiable despite his wide circle of acquaintances.\n[1896-12-23 04:11:59] Home | I thought that what she hadn't considered these \"althoughs\" were actually \"because\"s, only she hadn't recognized them.\n[1896-12-23 04:12:04] Home | I thought about how she had not thought (just as people are surprised by an old person's longevity, a king's disregard for etiquette, or a provincial's well-informed nature), Paul was precisely governed by the same habit, busily occupied yet quickly responding to letters, pleasant in society yet kind to Steven.\n[1896-12-23 04:12:09] Home | I thought, once again, that like all excessively modest people, Robert's mistake lay in placing things concerning herself below those of others, that is, outside of them.\n[1896-12-23 04:12:14] Home | I thought it was remarkable that she believed James could reply immediately, when in fact he wrote numerous letters every day, and this was just one of them, yet she regarded it as an exception among many.\n[1896-12-23 04:12:19] Home | I thought that she couldn't see that Paul coming to eat at Steven's house was merely one of his many social engagements, because she didn't realize that the ambassador, in his former diplomatic career, had been accustomed to regard an invitation to dinner as a duty, and to display his usual courteous manners.\n[1896-12-23 04:12:24] Home | I thought it would be too much to ask him to, for once, abandon his usual attentiveness at Steven's house.\n[1896-12-23 19:18:40] Champs-Élysées Street | I know that in the year Paul first came to dine at our house, Steven still often played along the Champs-Élysées.\n[1896-12-23 19:59:59] Home | I thought about how this meal would remain in Steven's memory, because that afternoon Steven finally got to see the matinee performance of \"Phedre\" starring Arthur.\n[1896-12-23 20:00:04] Home | I thought of it also because the conversation with Paul suddenly made Steven feel in a new way how different the feelings that Michael and her parents aroused in him were from those they would arouse in anyone else.\n[1896-12-23 20:00:09] Home | I know the New Year's holiday is coming. I thought of Steven, who was growing increasingly listless, because Michael had told him herself that he would never see her again during the holidays.\n[1896-12-23 20:00:14] Home | I saw that Robert had probably noticed Steven's mood, and to cheer him up one day, she said to Steven. I heard, \"If you still really want to see Arthur's play, Steven thinks James will agree, and David can take you.\"\n[1896-12-23 20:00:19] Home | I knew it was because Paul had once told James that Steven should go see Arthur's play, which would be a precious memory for a young person.\n[1896-12-23 20:00:39] Home | I knew that James had finally changed his usual attitude—he had opposed Steven for wasting time on what he called trivial matters (a view that shocked David) and risking getting sick and staying in bed.\n[1896-12-23 20:00:59] Home | I thought and almost believed that since the ambassador had advised Steven to go to the theater, going to the theater had apparently become one of the secrets to success.\n[1896-12-23 20:01:04] Home | I knew that David always believed Steven could learn a lot from Arthur's performances, but for Steven's sake she gave up going to the theater, making great sacrifices for his health.\n[1896-12-23 20:01:24] Home | I thought, at that moment, she was extremely astonished, because a single word from Paul had made Steven's health seem trivial.\n[1896-12-23 20:01:29] Home | I thought that she placed a rationalist's firm hope in Steven's habit of taking fresh air and going to bed early, and therefore believed that breaking such a habit would bring about disaster.\n[1896-12-23 20:01:34] Home | I saw her painfully say to James. I heard, \"You are too reckless!\"\n[1896-12-23 20:01:39] Home | I saw James answer angrily. \"I heard, 'What, you don't want him to go to the opera now? How absurd, you yourself said time and again that going to the opera is good for him.'\"\n[1896-12-23 20:01:44] Home | I knew that Paul had altered James's intention regarding another matter that was crucial to Steven.\n[1896-12-23 20:02:04] Home | I knew that James had always hoped Steven would become a diplomat, but Steven found it hard to accept.\n[1896-12-23 20:02:24] Home | I thought that even if Steven stayed for a while in the Ministry, one day he would be sent to some country as an ambassador, and Michael wouldn't be living there.\n[1896-12-23 20:02:29] Home | I thought of Steven's willingness to resume the literary plans he had conceived earlier when walking at the Fairhaven' house, which he had later abandoned.\n[1896-12-23 20:02:34] Home | I know that James always opposed Steven's pursuit of literature, considering it far more inferior to diplomacy. He even could not call it a profession.\n[1896-12-23 20:02:54] Home | I know, but one day, Paul, who usually looked down on the new generation of diplomats, said to James that being a writer was just as respected as being an ambassador, had the same influence, and offered even greater independence.\n[1896-12-23 20:03:14] Home | I heard James say to Steven, \"Well! I never expected Paul to have no objection to your pursuing literature.\"\n[1896-12-23 20:03:19] Home | I thought that my father was a person of considerable influence, and therefore believed that any problem could be resolved through conversation with an important person, and resolved satisfactorily.\n[1896-12-24 10:27:26] Home | I heard him say, \"In a few days, after the meeting, Steven will bring him to dinner. You can talk to him, show off a bit. Write something good for him to see. He's very close to the editor-in-chief of the Revue des Deux Mondes. He'll get you in, he'll arrange it. He's a shrewd old man, indeed, he seems to think that in today's world...\"",

    "text": "[1896-12-24 10:27:31] Room | I thought of the happiness of not being separated from Michael, which made Steven desire to write a good article for Paul--not out of ability.\n[1896-12-24 10:27:36] Room | I grew tired as I saw Steven start to write a few pages; the pen fell from Steven's hand, and Steven burst into tears in anger.\n[1896-12-24 10:27:46] Room | I thought of Steven, thinking that he would always be mediocre, that he had no talent, that he lacked the ability even to make use of the rare opportunity Paul was offering him to never leave Willowbrook.\n[1896-12-24 10:27:51] Room | I thought that when Steven was able to go and see Arthur's play, his sorrow was somewhat relieved.\n[1896-12-24 10:27:56] Room | I thought of the scenery that Steven loved best—the stormy seashore, because it was the most violent—and in a similar way, Steven's favorite actress was the one who played traditional roles, since Matthew had once told Steven that her art in portraying these roles was truly masterful.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:01] Room | I thought that when Stevenes wished to receive some natural or artistic impression in order to gain a valuable discovery, they certainly did not want their minds to be subjected to inferior impressions that might lead them astray in judging the true value of beauty.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:06] Room | I thought of Arthur performing Andromaque, Marianne the Fickle, and Hypermnestra—the magnificent scenes that Steven's imagination had longed for.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:11] Room | I thought that if Steven could hear Arthur reciting these lines: \"They say you are about to leave Steven and his friends, sir...,\" Steven would be completely entranced.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:16] Room | I thought of it as if I were taking a boat to the Church of Frari in Oakdale to see Titian's Virgin or to watch the series of paintings by Carpaccio, \"Saint George of Schiavoni.\"\n[1896-12-24 10:28:21] Room | When I thought of Steven, my heart would beat violently. I thought of these verses, which Steven had already read in the simple reproduction of black ink on white paper, but Steven would see them appear in the air and sunlight brought by the golden voice, as if realizing the dream of a journey.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:26] Room | I thought of Capaccio's Oakdale, Arthur in \"Phedra,\" masterpieces of painting and theater art, whose charm gave them life in Steven, making Steven feel that Capaccio and Oakdale, Arthur and \"Phedra\" were one and the same.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:31] Room | I thought that, if Steven were to look at a painting by Capacio in the Valleyview gallery, or hear Arthur recite a play that Steven had never heard of, Steven would no longer feel that wonderful astonishment, no longer feel that he had finally seen the extraordinary, unparalleled masterpiece that had long haunted his dreams.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:36] Room | I thought that, since Steven expected to gain some insight into the nobility and suffering of Arthur's performance, it would be even more remarkable and authentic if the actress performed a valuable work with her outstanding and genuine artistry, rather than adding a bit of truth and beauty to an ordinary and vulgar plot.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:41] Room | I thought that in any case, if Arthur was performing a new play, Steven would find it difficult to judge her acting and recitation.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:46] Room | I thought that because Steven couldn't distinguish the lines he didn't know in advance from the meaning imparted by her tone and gestures, he would feel they were inseparable from the script itself.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:51] Room | I thought the opposite: the old play that Steven could recite by heart seemed like a vast, specific space prepared in advance, in which Steven could freely judge how Arthur applied her fresh and original creativity to it as if it were a mural.\n[1896-12-24 10:28:56] Room | I knew that it was a pity she had left the big stage several years ago and become a star in a popular theater company, where she had made great contributions. She no longer performed classical dramas.\n[1896-12-24 10:29:16] Room | I saw Steven often looking through the advertisements. I knew, but what I always saw was a new play specially concocted for her by some fashionable writer.\n[1896-12-24 10:29:26] Room | One day, I saw Steven searching in the playbill for the matinee performances of the week of New Year's, and it was the first time he saw Arthur perform two acts from \"Phedre.\" I saw them in the closing act, because the opening piece was meaningless, its name obscure, containing all sorts of special plot elements unfamiliar to Steven.\n[1896-12-24 10:29:36] Room | I saw Steven, and also the \"Half-Upper-Class Society\" and \"Fickle Marianne\" for the next day and the day after.\n[1896-12-24 10:29:51] Room | I saw these names, like the name of \"Hedyle,\" clearly and brightly before Steven's eyes (since Steven was familiar with them), shining with an artistic smile.\n[1896-12-24 10:30:06] Room | I saw Steven reading another report saying that Arthur had decided to personally perform the roles she had created in the past. I thought they seemed to enhance Arthur's brilliance.\n[1896-12-24 10:30:11] Room | I thought that artists must know that the meaning of certain roles is not limited to their first performance, to surprise the audience, or to be successfully performed again.\n[1896-12-24 10:30:16] Room | I thought about how she regarded the role she played as a museum piece—an artifact to be shown again to the older generation who had once appreciated such treasures or to the younger generation who had never seen them, which was indeed very beneficial.\n[1896-12-24 10:30:21] Room | I saw that she had inserted the name \"Hippolyte\" into the listings for the performances meant only to pass the evening, a name no longer than any other and not set in a different typeface.\n[1896-12-24 10:30:36] Room | I thought of it, but she discreetly slipped it in, as if the hostess, when inviting guests to sit down, were to tell you the names of the ordinary guests one by one, then introduce the distinguished guest with the same tone: Mr. Anatole France.\n[1896-12-25 03:40:19] At home, the study | Before dinner, James called Steven into the study and introduced him to Paul.\n[1896-12-25 03:40:29] At home, the study | When I saw Steven go in, the ambassador stood up and bent his tall body to shake Steven's hand, his blue eyes watching Steven closely.\n[1896-12-25 03:40:39] At home, the study | I know that during his tenure as France's representative, people often introduced various foreigners to him, including some who had a certain degree of fame, even famous singers.\n[1896-12-25 03:40:59] At home, the study | I know that he understood, and one day, when people spoke of these men in Willowbrook or Meadowbrook, he would be able to boast that he had spent the evening with them in Hillside or Sofia. Therefore, he had developed this habit: showing great pleasure at meeting someone he had known.\n[1896-12-25 03:41:19] At home, the study | I thought that during his stay in a foreign capital, he would be able to meet interesting people traveling between the various capitals, as well as become familiar with the customs of the local population, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the history, geography, and customs of different nations, as well as of the cultural movements in Europe—knowledge not found in books.\n[1896-12-25 03:41:24] At home, the study | I saw that he applied his sharp sense of observation to every new arrival, in order to immediately figure out who was standing before him.\n[1896-12-25 03:41:34] At home, the study | I saw that whenever someone introduced a stranger to him, his eyes immediately made effective observations, as if they had not received any suspension notice, and his manner and conversation tried to indicate that the newcomer's name was not unfamiliar to him. I knew that for a long time, he had no longer been posted abroad.\n[1896-12-25 03:41:44] At home, the study | I saw that he spoke to Steven in a friendly manner, with the air of an important person who knew a lot, while at the same time observing Steven with sharp curiosity and for his own interests.",

    "text": "[1896-12-25 03:41:54] Home's study | I thought of Steven as a kind of exotic, instructive monument with its own customs, or perhaps a touring celebrity.\n[1896-12-25 03:41:59] Home study room | I thought that, in a way, he was both solemn and kind like the wise Unknown_Mentor, and full of diligent curiosity like the young Unknown_Anacharsis.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:04] At home study room | I saw that he never mentioned anything about the \"Review of Two Worlds\" in connection with Steven, but he asked a series of questions about Steven's past life and studies, about Steven's interests.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:14] Home study room | I thought that this was the first time Steven had heard someone speak of pursuing a hobby as a reasonable thing to do, because before this, Steven had always believed that hobbies should be suppressed.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:19] At home, the study | I saw that since Steven was fond of literature, he kept the conversation centered on it, speaking of it with immense reverence. I thought of it as a respectable and charming lady from the upper class.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:24] Home study room | I saw him smile with an almost wanton expression, as if envying Steven for being luckier, more at ease, able to spend beautiful moments with it. I knew he had met her in Northgate or Dresden and had beautiful memories of their encounter, but later, because of the demands of life, he rarely had the chance to meet her again.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:34] The study at home | I thought, but the literary image conveyed by his words was entirely different from the one Steven had imagined for literature when he was in Sunrise, and so Steven realized he had two reasons to give up on literature.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:39] At home, the study | I thought about how, before, Steven had only been aware of his lack of creative talent, but now Paul had made Steven lose all desire to create.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:44] At home, the study | I saw Steven trying to explain his dream to him. Steven trembled with excitement. I thought of the fear that all words might not be able to express most sincerely what Steven had felt but never tried to reveal to himself.\n[1896-12-25 03:42:49] The study at home | I saw Steven speaking incoherently, and when you explained it to Paul, his face remained absolutely motionless. I saw something that made you think you were facing a classical bust in a stone sculpture gallery—and it was deaf!\n[1896-12-25 03:42:59] Home study room | I know this may be due to professional habit, or perhaps to the usual indifference people have (since those who come to him for advice place themselves in his hands, and he remains unmoved, allowing them to feel uneasy and struggle desperately, while he remains indifferent), or may be it's because he wants to emphasize the feature of his head (he believed he had a Greek-type skull, despite his thick sideburns).\n[1896-12-25 03:43:19] At home, the study | I saw that suddenly, the ambassador's reply rang out. I saw it as if it were the hammer of an auctioneer's appraiser or the oracle of Delphi. I thought of it as exciting, because from his expressionless face you could not guess what he thought of you or what opinion he was about to express.\n[1896-12-25 03:43:24] Home study room | I saw him staring unblinkingly at the stammering Steven, and suddenly made a conclusive statement. I heard, \"By chance, Steven has a friend whose son, mutatis mutandis, is just like you.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:43:29] Home study room | I saw that he spoke in a consoling tone about the common tendencies of the Stevenes. I thought that it was not a tendency towards literature, but rather towards rheumatism, and he wanted to tell Steven that Steven would not die from it.\n[1896-12-25 03:43:34] Home study room | I heard that he had given up the diplomatic career James had arranged for him, and without regard for rumors, he threw himself into writing. Naturally, he had nothing to regret.\n[1896-12-25 03:43:39] The study at home | I heard him say, \"Two years ago—of course he was much older than you— he published a work about his impressions of the 'infinite' on the western shore of Lake Vichy-Nianges.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:43:44] At home, the study | I heard, \"He's written another little booklet this year, slightly shorter in length but with a sharp, even acerbic style, about the repeating rifles in the Bulgarian army. These two books made him a notable figure.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:43:49] At home, the study | I heard him say, \"He's already come a long way and won't stop in the middle. At the Ethical Academy, they've mentioned him two or three times, and without any disapproval, although he hasn't been considered as a candidate yet.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:43:54] At home, the study | I heard, \"In short, he can't yet be considered renowned, but his tenacious struggle has already earned him a superior position and achievements.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:43:59] At home, the study | I heard him say, \"To know that success does not always belong to those who are restless, provocative, and create chaos—most of them are full of themselves. He achieved fame through hard work.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:44:04] At home, the study | I saw that James had already foreseen Steven becoming an academician years later, and was therefore very pleased; Paul now took this satisfaction to its peak.\n[1896-12-25 03:44:09] The study at home | After a brief hesitation, as if weighing the consequences of his actions, he handed Steven a business card and said. I heard, \"You should go and see him, just say that Steven introduced you. He'll give you some useful advice.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:44:14] Home study room | I thought of his words that had stirred Steven with unease, as if he had announced that Steven would sail away the next day as an apprentice sailor.\n[1896-12-25 03:44:19] In the study at home | I knew that Steven had inherited from his aunt Léonie a number of unmanageable items and furniture, as well as almost all of her cash assets (she had expressed her love for Steven after her death, while during her lifetime Steven had been completely unaware of it).\n[1896-12-25 03:44:39] At home, the study | I saw that the money would be managed by James until Steven came of age, so James asked Paul where to invest it.\n[1896-12-25 03:44:49] The study at home | I saw Paul recommending the purchase of what he considered very safe securities, especially the British consols and the Russian bonds with a four percent interest rate. He said. I heard, \"This is first-rate securities; although the interest isn't very high, the principal at least won't lose value.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:44:54] Home study room | I saw that, as for the rest, James briefly told the guest what he had bought, and the guest gave an almost imperceptible smile, expressing his congratulations.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:04] At home, the study | I thought of Paul, who, like all capitalists, considered wealth something to be envied, but when it came to someone else's property, he felt it was more appropriate to express his congratulations in a discreet and understanding manner.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:09] The study at home | I thought that, because he himself was extremely wealthy, he regarded people far less affluent than himself as rich men, while at the same time taking pleasure and satisfaction in his own superior position in terms of wealth.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:14] Home study room | I saw him congratulate James on his \"very steady, elegant, and perceptive appreciation\" of the \"structure\" of the securities. I thought that he seemed to endow the mutual relationships of stock transactions, even the stock transactions themselves, with some aesthetic value.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:19] Home study room | I saw James talking about a relatively new and little-known security, at which point Paul said (you think only you have read this book, but he has too). I heard, \"Steven certainly knows, he paid attention to its price for a while, it's very interesting.\"",

    "text": "[1896-12-25 03:45:24] At home, the study | I saw him wearing a dreamy smile, as if he were a subscriber to a magazine, reading in sections the latest serial novel published in it.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:34] At home, the study | I heard, \"Steven doesn't discourage you from buying the upcoming securities; they are very attractive and offer favorable prices.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:45:39] Home study room | I saw that for certain old securities, James had forgotten their names, often confusing them with similar ones, so he opened the drawer and took them out to show the ambassador.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:49] Home study room | I saw them adorned with the spires of churches and symbolic imagery. I thought of Steven, who had been deeply fascinated at first sight, for they were very much like the imaginative old publications Steven had once read.\n[1896-12-25 03:45:54] The study at home | I know that things belonging to the same period are all very similar. The artist painted pictures of the poetry of a certain era, and was also employed by the financial companies of that time.\n[1896-12-25 03:46:14] Home study room | I saw the registered securities issued by the Hebo Development Company, which was a long-shaped security with ornate patterns, its four corners supported by river gods. I thought of it, and it immediately made Steven recall the books of *Notre-Dame de Willowbrook* and Gérard de Nerval hanging in the window of the Sunrise grocery store.\n[1896-12-25 03:46:19] The study at home | I saw him call for Steven without hesitation, asking him to bring the prose poem Steven had written during his walks in Sunrise. I knew that James looked down on Steven's kind of intelligence, but this contempt was often restrained by paternal love, so in general, he showed blind tolerance toward everything Steven did.\n[1896-12-25 03:46:29] At home, the study | I saw that Paul was utterly unmoved; he returned the item to Steven without a word. I thought about how Steven had written it with great passion, and therefore Steven believed that anyone who read it would be deeply moved.\n[1896-12-25 03:46:34] Home study room | I saw Robert come in and timidly asked if we could start eating. I knew that Robert had always shown the utmost respect for James's affairs, fearing she might interrupt a conversation she was not supposed to be part of.\n[1896-12-25 03:46:44] Home study room | I saw that at this moment, James was indeed speaking to the Marquis about the necessary measures to be proposed at the next committee meeting. I thought of his particular tone, which reminded me of two colleagues—like two high school students—speaking in the manner of outsiders, sharing common memories due to their professional habits, but since outsiders knew nothing about them, they could only speak of the past in a somewhat apologetic tone when in front of these outsiders.\n[1896-12-25 03:46:49] Home study room | I knew that at this moment, Paul's facial muscles had reached a perfect state of independence, so he could listen with an expression of not hearing a word.\n[1896-12-25 03:47:09] Home study room | I saw James finally become uneasy. After beating around the bush, he finally said. I heard \"Steven had originally wanted to ask the committee's opinion...\"\n[1896-12-25 03:47:14] Home study room | I heard this remark, delivered with a certain hauteur, from the face of this accomplished performer, from the face that was as vacant and expectant as a musician's, spoken at a leisurely pace, almost ending the already begun musical phrase with a different tone: \"Of course, you can certainly call a meeting of the committee, especially since you know each of them personally, and it would be easy for them to come.\" I thought that the ending itself was obviously nothing new, but the state that had preceded it made it stand out, making it as crisp and clear as a phrase on the piano, cleverly fresh and original, like the moment in a Mozart concerto when the silent piano finally takes over from the cello that had just been playing.\n[1896-12-25 03:47:19] Dining room | I heard James ask Steven as we took our seats at the table: \"Well, was the play to your satisfaction?\" I thought he was trying to show off Steven, believing that Steven's excitement would win Paul's favor.\n[1896-12-25 03:47:24] Dining room | I saw him turn to the diplomat and speak in a nostalgic, technical, and mysterious tone, as if he were talking about the committee. I heard, \"He just went to see Arthur's play. You remember how Steven and the others used to talk about it.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:47:29] Dining Room | \"I heard, 'You'll certainly be very pleased, especially since this is your first time seeing her perform. Your father was worried that this small entertainment might harm your health. It seems you're not very strong, a frail scholar.'\"\n[1896-12-25 03:47:34] Dining room | I heard him say, \"But Steven assured him there's a big difference now compared to twenty years ago. The seats are fairly comfortable, and the air is constantly refreshed. Of course, the Stevenes still have a long way to go before they catch up with Germany and England, which are far more advanced than them in this as well as many other aspects.\"\n[1896-12-25 03:47:39] Dining room | I heard, \"Steven hasn't seen Arthur perform in Phèdre, but Steven has heard that her acting is extraordinary. You must be very satisfied, I suppose?\"\n[1896-12-25 19:17:17] Dining room | I thought Paul was a thousand times smarter than Steven, and he certainly grasped the truth that Steven had failed to understand from Arthur's acting; he would reveal it to Steven.\n[1896-12-25 19:17:22] Dining room | I thought that Steven would have to answer his question, that he would ask Steven to tell him the truth, and in doing so, he would prove to Steven that it was indeed worth his while to have gone to see Arthur's performance.\n[1896-12-25 19:17:27] Dining Room | I realized I had little time left and should raise the basic questions, but which were the basic questions?\n[1896-12-25 19:17:32] Dining room | I saw Steven speaking haltingly, unable to resort to ready-made phrases to make up for his limited vocabulary, and in order to finally prompt him to express the beauty of Arthur, Steven admitted that he had been deeply disappointed. I thought of Steven, completely absorbed in his thoughts about the vague impressions he had received, too preoccupied to consider how to win the approval of M. de Paul, and instead solely focused on obtaining from him the truth that Steven longed for.\n[1896-12-25 19:17:37] Dining room | I saw James exclaim in anger, because Steven's self-declared obtuse declaration would leave a bad impression on Paul. \"I heard, 'How can you say you didn't feel the slightest pleasure? David said you were completely absorbed in every line Arthur spoke, staring wide-eyed, no audience ever looked at her the way you did.'\"\n[1896-12-25 19:17:42] Dining room | \"I heard, 'Yes, Steven is completely absorbed. Steven wants to know where her excellence lies. Of course, she acts very well...\"\n[1896-12-25 19:17:47] Dining room | I heard, \"If it's so good, what else do you want?\"\n[1896-12-25 19:17:52] Dining room | I saw Paul say something, turning his head specifically toward Robert, both to avoid leaving her out of the conversation and also to show the hostess the proper respect. \"I heard that one thing definitely contributing to Arthur's success was her perfect taste in choosing roles, precisely this taste that brought her real, well-earned success.\"\n[1896-12-25 19:17:57] Dining Room | I heard, \"She rarely plays ordinary roles; this time she's playing Chantelle. Besides, her taste is evident in both her costume and her acting.\"\n[1896-12-25 19:18:02] Dining room | I heard that \"she often toured England and America and was highly praised, but she didn't acquire any vulgar habits. Steven wasn't referring to John Bull, which would have been unfair, at least for Victorian England. Steven was referring to Uncle Sam.\"\n[1896-12-25 19:18:07] Dining Room | I heard her say, \"She never used overly glaring colors, never screamed with all her might. Her beautiful, pleasant voice added to her charm, and the way she used her voice was so skillful, truly that of a singer!\"\n[1896-12-25 19:18:12] Dining room | I thought that since the performance was over, Steven's interest in Arthur's art was no longer restrained by reality, and it grew stronger and stronger, but Steven had to find an explanation for it.\n[1896-12-25 19:18:17] Dining room | I thought to myself that when Arthur performed, she gave Steven's eyes and ears something that was seamlessly unified in life, and Steven's interest was merely a general attention without any distinction or differentiation.",

It exerted its attraction, appropriating the compliments, just as a cheerful drunkard would appropriate his neighbor's behavior and then make a big deal out of it.\n[1896-12-25 19:18:27] Dining Room | I thought to myself: \"Yes, what a beautiful voice, no shouting, such simple clothing! Choosing the role of Chouans was so wise! No, Steven wasn't disappointed.\"\n[1896-12-25 19:18:32] Dining Room | I saw the carrot and beef cold dish appear. Under the \"Michelangelo\" design of Steven's kitchen, the beef lay on top of large, crystalline lumps as clear as quartz.\n[1896-12-25 19:18:47] Dining room | I heard Paul say, \"Your chef is first-rate, madam, truly rare! Steven often has to make a show of it abroad, so Steven knows how difficult it is to find an excellent cook. This is truly a feast.\"\n[1896-12-25 19:18:52] Dining room | I know it's true—Françoise was delighted to prepare a sumptuous meal for the guest, showing off her skills. She put in all her effort to rekindle the techniques she had perfected in Sunrise, though she no longer bothered to make such an effort when there were no guests to dine.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:17] Dining Room | I saw him speaking as he made a gesture indicating he wanted a little more juice. I heard, \"This is a nightclub, Steven, the finest kind, where you can't even begin to imagine. Braised beef, with no floury smell, just the fragrance of carrots, truly remarkable! Please allow Steven to add some more.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:37:22] Dining room | I heard, \"Steven really wants to try another of the lady's specialties, for example, her Stroganoff-style beef.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:37:27] Dining Room | I saw Paul, in order to add some charm to the table, serving up to Steven and his companions the various stories he often told to his colleagues.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:32] Dining room | Sometimes he quoted a politician's ridiculous complex sentence (a technique this man was fond of), sentences that were long-winded and full of contradictory images.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:37] Dining Room | I sometimes saw him quote the witty remarks of a refined diplomat.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:42] Dining room | I realized that his criteria for these two styles had absolutely nothing in common with Steven's standards for literature. He failed to understand many subtle distinctions that Steven did not grasp at all.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:47] Dining room | I thought that the phrases he laughed at and mocked, and the phrases he praised endlessly, made little difference in Steven's eyes.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:52] Dining Room | I thought he was a different kind of person; when it came to works that Steven loved, he would say, \"You understood it? Honestly, Steven didn't get it, Steven wasn't up to it.\" And Steven could return the favor; in his refutations or speeches, the cleverness or stupidity, the eloquence or exaggeration that Steven saw, he himself could not grasp.\n[1896-12-26 00:37:57] Dining room | I thought that since there was no perceivable reason to explain why one was better than the other, this literature was all the more mysterious and obscure in Steven's eyes.\n[1896-12-26 00:38:02] Dining Room | I thought to myself that Steven realized that repeating another person's thoughts was not a sign of weakness in politics, but rather a sign of strength.\n[1896-12-26 00:38:07] Dining room | I saw how Paul would take certain phrases from the newspapers and emphasize them with a particular tone. I thought that once these expressions were used by him, they became actions, noticeable actions.\n[1896-12-26 00:38:12] Dining room | I saw Robert had high hopes for the pineapple and truffle salad. The Major gazed at the dish with the penetrating look of an observer, then took a bite, but with the cautious demeanor of a diplomat, no longer revealing his thoughts.\n[1896-12-26 00:38:17] Dining room | I saw Robert insisting that he eat a bit more, and Paul added some more, but he didn't say the flattering words people expected; he just said. \"I heard, 'Yes, madam, since this is your command.'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:22] Dining room | I heard James say, \"The paper says you had a long conversation with Emperor Theodosius.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:27] Dining room | \"I heard him say, 'It's remarkable. The King has an extraordinary memory for faces. That day, he saw Steven sitting in the front row of the orchestra and remembered him, because Steven had met him several times before in the Bavarian court, though he had never imagined that this man would one day inherit the eastern throne (you know, he was invited to take the throne by the European Congress, and he hesitated for a long time before agreeing, as he felt the throne was not quite suitable for his family, which was the most noble in all Europe).\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:32] Dining room | I heard \"a aide-de-camp came to ask Steven to see the King, and Steven of course was happy to comply.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:37] Dining room | I heard, \"Are you satisfied with the results of his visit?\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:42] Dining Room | I heard, \"Very satisfied! At first, some people worried whether this young monarch could escape from such a complicated situation, and that concern was understandable. As for Steven, Steven completely trusted his political instincts, and the facts far exceeded Steven's expectations.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:47] Dining Room | I heard someone say, \"According to authoritative sources, his speech at the Elysée Palace, from the first word to the last, was entirely written by himself, and it naturally won widespread favor. That was indeed a clever move. Of course, it was somewhat bold, but the facts have proven that this boldness was justified.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:52] Dining Room | \"I heard that 'the diplomatic tradition certainly has its merits, but it is precisely because of this that the relations between Steven's countries are shrouded in a suffocating, closed atmosphere. The way to bring in fresh air is to break the glass window. Naturally, others could not have suggested such an idea, only Emperor Theodosius could do so, and he indeed did.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:38:57] Dining room | I heard someone say, \"His open and honest manner won everyone's admiration; his language was appropriately refined, truly worthy of his mother's lineage as a learned and noble aristocrat.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:02] Dining Room | I saw that his last words were addressed to Steven. \"I heard him use the term 'kinship' when speaking about the relationship between his country and France. Such wording is extremely rare in diplomatic language, yet it was perfectly appropriate. You see, literature is of no harm, not even to diplomacy or to monarchs.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:07] Dining room | \"I heard him say, 'Of course, there had been signs of this all along. The relations between the two great powers had already improved, but it was still remarkable that he finally said it out loud. His words were exactly what people expected, and they were phrased so skillfully that the effect was astonishing. Naturally, Steven gave it his full support.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:12] Dining Room | I heard, \"Your friend Unknown_Vaugoubert has worked for many years to improve relations between the two countries; he must be very pleased.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:17] Dining Room | I heard, \"Of course, besides, the king, as usual, wanted to surprise him. Moreover, everyone, starting with the minister of foreign affairs, was taken aback, without exception.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:22] Dining Room | I heard that the foreign minister was not very pleased with the matter. When someone asked him about it, he raised his voice so that those around him could hear his blunt reply: \"Steven wasn't consulted, nor was he informed.\" This clearly showed that he had nothing to do with it.\n[1896-12-26 00:39:27] Dining room | I saw him smile slyly, then he spoke again. \"I heard, 'Of course, this has caused a lot of discussion. Steven isn't sure his colleagues, who take 'non-action' as their highest principle, won't be unsettled by it.'\"",

Besides, he's a kind and sensitive man. Steven can confirm that. Although he's much younger than Steven, they've been old friends for a long time and often correspond. Steven knows him well.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:37] Dining room | I heard, \"Who doesn't know him? His soul is transparent to the point of being his only fault, since diplomats don't need to be so open.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:42] Dining room | \"I heard that someone is suggesting sending him to Northgate. That's certainly an advancement, but also a 'dry bone' to chew on. Steven is telling you this in confidence: Unknown_Vaugoubert may have no ambitions, but he won't be unhappy about the new post. He'll certainly not refuse this bitter cup. He might even achieve miracles.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:47] Dining room | I heard, \"He is the person approved by Pinecrest. For such an artist, the Palazzo Farnese and the Corridore di Caracci are the most appropriate places. At least no one will hate him.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:39:52] Dining room | I heard that around Emperor Theodosius, there was a group of sycophants attached to Eastwood, who obediently carried out Eastwood's intentions and did everything they could to harass Unknown_Vaugoubert. Unknown_Vaugoubert had not only to deal with court intrigues but also with the insults from literary hangers-on.\n[1896-12-26 00:39:57] Dining room | \"I heard that they, like all caged journalists, timidly begged for mercy, yet at the same time continued to publish baseless accusations by hooligans against Steven's representative. For more than a month, the enemy danced a scalp dance around Unknown_Vaugoubert.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:40:02] Dining room | I saw Paul especially emphasizing that last word: \"However, as the saying goes, 'Forewarned is forearmed.' He kicked aside the slander and abuse. I heard his voice grow louder, his eyes flashing with fury, so that the Stevenes stopped eating for a moment.\n[1896-12-26 00:40:07] Dining Room | I saw Paul toss out this proverb and then look at the Stevenes, watching what effect it had on them. I heard the words, \"There's a beautiful Arabic proverb: 'Let the dogs bark, the caravan still moves on.'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:40:12] Dining Room | I knew the effect was significant. The Stevenes were familiar with it, because that year it was popular among people of standing, while the saying \"He who sows thorns reaps thorns\" had been discarded, because it lacked energy, unlike \"Toil for others,\" which never tired and always remained full of vigor.\n[1896-12-26 00:40:17] Dining room | I knew that the language of these social celebrities changed every three years, like a crop rotation system.\n[1896-12-26 00:40:22] Dining Room | I know that Paul is skilled at using this type of citation in his articles in the Revue des Deux Mondes, although they are entirely superfluous in well-researched, reliable articles.\n[1896-12-26 00:40:27] Dining room | I knew Paul didn't really need all these embellishments; he just chose the crucial moments—and that's exactly what he did—such as \"St. James felt the crisis was imminent,\" or \"the singers were agitated, anxiously watching the selfish and cunning policies of the dual monarchy.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:40:32] Dining Room | I know that or \"Montecitorio is on alert\"; or \"the two-faced tactics always used in the Place de l'Opéra.\" Even a lay reader, upon seeing these expressions, immediately understands that the author is a professional diplomat and expresses admiration.\n[1896-12-26 00:40:37] Dining room | I know, but some people said he was more than just a professional diplomat; his refinement was even more remarkable because he used proverbs with perfect timing. The most perfect example was the saying, \"As Baron Louis said, you give Steven good politics, and Steven gives you good finances.\" (Because at that time, the Japanese proverb \"He who holds out a moment longer in battle is sure to win\" had not yet come from the East.)\n[1896-12-26 00:40:42] Dining room | I knew it was precisely this reputation of a renowned scholar, along with the genuine conspiratorial genius hidden behind his indifferent mask, that had made Paul an academician of the École de Philosophie Morale, and some even believed he could have been admitted to the Académie Française without difficulty.\n[1896-12-26 00:40:47] Dining Room | I know that once, when he was pointing out the necessity of an alliance with Russia in order to reconcile with England, he actually wrote: \"One thing should be made clear to the people in the Foreign Office, and should be included in all geography textbooks (there is indeed a gap in this area), and should be a standard for high school graduates receiving their baccalaureate: if 'all roads lead to Northgate,' then from Willowbrook to London one must pass through Meadowbrook.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:40:52] Dining room | I heard Paul continue to say to James, \"In any case, Unknown_Vaugoubert has had a great success this time, even exceeding his own expectations. Of course, he expected a very decent toast (which, after the recent clouds, was already quite remarkable), but he hadn't anticipated something even better than that.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:40:57] Dining Room | I heard people who had been present say to Steven that the effect of the toast could not be fully grasped by reading it afterward. The king was a true artist in speech; his reading, his pauses were all carefully measured, enabling the audience to grasp all the nuances and subtle meanings.\n[1896-12-26 00:41:02] Dining Room | I heard him say, \"Steven has heard about a very interesting story, which once again proves Emperor Theodosius had that popular youthful charm. The term 'family ties' was quite an innovation in the speech; you see, it will become a topic of discussion among the embassies for a long time.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:07] Dining Room | I heard \"Your Majesty, when he uttered the word, probably thought it would greatly please Steven, this ambassador—this was a fitting reward for his efforts, even for his dreams, and would earn him the marshal's baton. So he half-turned toward Unknown_Vaugoubert, gazing at him with the charming eyes of the Audiffred family, and said slowly, syllable by syllable, the very appropriate and remarkable word 'affinity.'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:12] Dining room | I heard his tone indicated that he used the word with great care, and he was thoroughly familiar with its weight. It was said that Unknown_Vaugoubert was so overcome with emotion that he could hardly contain himself; in some way, Steven thought he could understand his feelings.\n[1896-12-26 00:41:17] Dining Room | I heard that, according to a very reliable source, after the party, the King approached Unknown_Vaugoubert, who was lost in the crowd, and whispered to him, \"Are you satisfied with Steven as a student, dear Marquis?\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:22] Dining room | I heard Paul say again, \"Clearly, the power of this toast has exceeded twenty years of negotiations, and it has brought the two countries even closer—using the vivid language of Emperor Theodosius II, 'a kinship'.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:27] Dining Room | \"I heard him say, 'It's just a word, but you'll see, it will take off, the whole of Europe's newspapers are repeating it, it has aroused widespread interest, it has made a new sound. Incidentally, this is the king's usual way of doing things.'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:32] Dining Room | I heard that Steven didn't dare to say he could find such pure diamonds every day, but in his carefully prepared speeches or in his spontaneous conversations, he always managed to slip in a witty remark as his trademark—or rather, his signature. In this regard, Steven was absolutely impartial, because he had always been against such witticisms, and nineteen out of twenty were dangerous.\n[1896-12-26 00:41:37] Dining Room | I heard James say, \"Yes. Steven must have found the latest telegram from the German Emperor rather unpalatable.\"",

First of all, it's ungrateful, not just a mistake but a crime, truly shocking stupidity! Second, if no one stops him, this man who drove out Unknown_Bismarck might gradually abandon all of Unknown_Bismarck's policies, and then who knows what could happen.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:47] Dining Room | \"I heard that Steven's husband told Steven, 'Sir, you might be planning to take him with you to Spain in the next two or three summers, and Steven is really happy about it.'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:52] Dining room | \"I heard, 'Yes, it's an attractive plan. Steven is very happy, Steven would be delighted to travel with you, dear friend. And you, madam, how do you plan to spend your vacation?'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:41:57] Dining Room | I heard, \"I don't know. May be he's going to Riverside with his son.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:02] Dining room | \"I heard, 'Ah! Riverside is a fine place. Steven went there a few years ago. They're building beautiful, charming villas there, and Steven thinks you'd like it. But can you tell Steven why you've chosen this place?\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:07] Dining room | I heard that Steven's son really wanted to see the church, especially the Sainte-Chapelle. Steven was initially a bit worried, fearing the journey would be tiring, especially with the inconvenience of food and lodging, which might affect his health. However, he recently heard that a very good hotel had been built there, with all the comfortable facilities he needed, so he could stay for a while.\n[1896-12-26 00:42:12] Dining Room | \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven must tell this news to a lady who is very concerned about it.'\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:17] Dining Room | I heard Steven suppressing his annoyance, since in his eyes the charm of Riverside lay in its beautiful, elegant villas. Steven asked, \"Is the Sainte-Chapelle remarkable, sir?\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:22] Dining Room | I heard, \"Not bad, really not bad, but after all, it can't compare to a truly refined treasure, like the Sainte-Chapelle, the Sainte-Chapelle, and the very finest of treasures—the Sainte-Chapelle in Willowbrook that Steven loved most.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:27] Dining room | I heard, \"Part of the Sainte-Chapelle is Romanesque, isn't it?\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:32] Dining room | I heard him say, \"It's Romanesque, this style is extremely rigid, not as good as the later Gothic architecture. Gothic is elegant and novel, with stones intricately carved with lace-like edges.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:37] Translation: Dining room | I heard him say, \"A part of the Sainte-Chapelle is quite unique. Since you're there, the church is certainly worth a visit. If it rains and you have nowhere to go, you can go inside and see the tomb of Tuitterville.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:42] Dining Room | I heard James say, \"Did you attend the embassy banquet yesterday? Steven couldn't make it.\"\n[1896-12-26 00:42:47] Dining Room | I heard Paul respond with a smile: \"No, honestly, Steven didn't go. He attended another completely different party. Steven went to dinner at a lady's house—probably someone you've heard of, the beautiful John.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:39:40] Dining Room | I saw Robert control a shudder, because she was more sensitive than James and was already worried about the discomfort he was about to feel. I thought that his unhappiness was often sensed first by her, just like bad news from France is known abroad before it reaches the inside.\n[1896-12-26 19:39:45] Dining room | I saw that, but she wanted to know what kind of people the Matthews entertained, so she asked Paul whom he had met there.\n[1896-12-26 19:39:50] Dining room | I saw the Duke speak in a subtly innocent tone, glancing around him, his gentle and cautious gaze seeming to try to soften the mockery, but in fact only more skillfully enhancing its effect. \"I heard 'Steven's sky... those who went there were mostly... men. There were a few married men, but their wives weren't feeling well and didn't go.'\"\n[1896-12-26 19:39:55] Dining Room | \"I heard him say, 'One must be fair, there were some ladies there too, but... they belonged... how should I put it, rather to Matthew's (he pronounced it 'Svane') social circle than to the Republicans.'\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:00] Dining Room | \"I heard 'Who knows? Perhaps one day it will become a political salon or a cultural salon, and they seem quite satisfied with that.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:05] Dining Room | \"I heard Steven think that Matthew was being overly boastful, constantly talking about how so-and-so and so-and-so had invited them for the following week. But what was there to be proud of in such acquaintances? He was neither steady nor interesting, and seemed to have no sense of propriety at all. It was surprising that a man of his refinement could behave so poorly.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:10] Dining room | I heard him say, \"The Stevenes have dinners every night.\" As if it were something glorious, as if he had become a new aristocrat, when in fact he wasn't. He used to have many friends, even many girlfriends.\n[1896-12-26 19:40:15] Dining Room | I heard him say, \"Here, Steven didn't want to overstep or be too forward, but Steven thought that among his girlfriends, at least one—though not all or most of them—was of such high status that she wouldn't have definitely refused to meet John, and thus many people would have ended up like Ponge, following in his footsteps.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:20] Dining Room | \"I heard, 'However, Matthew seemed to have made no effort at all. Ah, there's the Nesselrode pudding! After this Lucullan feast, Steven will surely go to Karlsbad for treatment.'\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:25] Dining Room | I heard someone say, \"Perhaps Matthew found the resistance too great to overcome. His marriage was certainly unpleasant. Some people said the lady was rich, which was nonsense. In any case, all of this seemed rather unpleasant.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:30] Dining room | I heard that Matthew had an aunt with a huge fortune and high social standing. Her husband, in terms of wealth, could be considered very affluent. But she not only refused to receive John, but also launched a real campaign to have her friends and acquaintances boycott John.\n[1896-12-26 19:40:35] Dining room | \"I heard 'Steven, this isn't to say that any well-mannered Willowbrookian showed disrespect toward John... No! Absolutely not! Besides, her husband was a man who would fight duels.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:40] Dining Room | I heard, \"After all, it's strange that Matthew, who has such wide-ranging connections and frequently moves in high society, should be so attentive to people who can at best be called riffraff.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:45] Dining Room | I heard that Steven had known him, a man of refined manners who was well-known in the highest social circles. But now he was so grateful that the head of the postal office had deigned to visit, and he even asked John if she would be \"honored\" to call on the head's wife. This made Steven both astonished and amused.\n[1896-12-26 19:40:50] Dining Room | I heard, \"He was probably uncomfortable, because this was clearly two different worlds. But Steven thought he wasn't suffering.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:40:55] Dining room | I heard, \"In the years before the marriage, that woman did indeed play many tricks to extort him. Every time he refused her, she would take the daughter away from him.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:41:00] Dining Room | I heard them say, \"Poor Matthew, this connoisseur was too naive; he always thought his daughter's kidnapping was just a coincidence. He refused to face reality, and she would often fly into a rage at him. So people thought that once she achieved her goal and became his wife, she would be even more reckless, and their life would become a hell.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:41:05] Dining room | I heard \"Yet quite the opposite!

Everyone has their own way of doing things.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:41:45] Dining Room | I knew she even almost believed, as he had said in a rage, that he would completely abandon her, because she had heard a female sculptor say, \"Men are capable of anything, they are heartless and faithless.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:41:50] Dining Room | I knew that John was deeply moved by this profound and pessimistic saying, and she often quoted it, treating it as her creed.\n[1896-12-26 19:41:55] Dining room | I saw the look of disappointment on her face as if she were saying, \"There's nothing that can't be done, Steven, let's take a chance.\" I knew that her former optimistic life philosophy had been: \"You can do anything to a man who loves you, they're fools.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:42:00] Dining room | I saw her facial expression was just a blink, as if saying, \"Don't be afraid, he won't break anything.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:42:05] Dining Room | I knew that one of John's girlfriends had been living with a man for a shorter time than John had lived with Matthew, and they hadn't had any children either, yet she had ended up marrying him and was now quite respected, invited to the balls at the Elysée Palace.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:10] Dining room | I know what she would think of Matthew's behavior? John was deeply troubled by it.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:15] Dining room | I thought that if there were a doctor more profound than Paul, he would probably diagnose that John's irascibility came from this feeling of humiliation and shame; her harsh and violent exterior was not her true nature, nor was it an incurable condition.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:20] Dining Room | I thought that he would easily predict what later indeed happened: a new relationship--a marital one--would miraculously make these unbearable, daily occurrences, though not of a fundamental nature, disappear immediately.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:25] Dining room | What surprised me was that almost everyone was astonished by this marriage. They probably didn't understand that the phenomenon of love is purely subjective, that it's an act of creation in which many elements of Steven himself are projected onto someone in society, thereby creating a person entirely unlike the original name.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:30] Dining Room | I thought about how people often find it incomprehensible that someone could be so important in the eyes of the Stevenes, when in fact it's not the same person that the Stevenes see.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:35] Dining Room | I know, but when it comes to John, one should realize that although (of course) she did not fully understand Matthew's inner life, she at least knew the subject of his research and all the details. She was as familiar with the name Vermeer as she was with the name of her dressmaker.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:40] Dining Room | I knew she understood Matthew's entire character. I thought of the kind of man whose character is often overlooked or mocked by the world, yet appears real and charming only in the eyes of his mistress or sister.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:45] Dining room | I thought that Stevenes cherish their own personalities, even those they very much wish to change. Therefore, when a woman becomes accustomed to it and responds with tolerance and good-natured teasing (as Stevenes themselves are accustomed to it, as are their parents), old love becomes gentle and intense, like family affection.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:50] Dining room | I thought that when someone stands in Steven's position to comment on Steven's flaws, the relationship between him and Steven becomes sacred.\n[1896-12-26 19:42:55] Dining room | I knew that among these traits, some were related both to Matthew's intelligence and his character, and since they originated in his personality, John was most sensitive to them.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:00] Dining room | I knew she complained that people didn't notice how the many qualities Matthew displayed in his letters and conversation also appeared in his writings and scholarly articles. She urged him to make better use of these qualities.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:05] Dining Room | I knew she was happy in this way because what she appreciated in him was precisely those things, and she loved them because they belonged to him; therefore, it was natural for her to want people to discover them in his work.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:10] Dining Room | I knew that perhaps she thought more vivid works would ultimately make him famous and enable her to achieve the supreme ambition she had dreamed of in the Verdurin's house: a salon.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:15] Dining Room | I know some people think such a marriage is absurd and ridiculous; they put themselves in the situation and ask: \"What would Samuel think if Steven married Mademoiselle de Montmorency? What would Breteuil say?\"\n[1896-12-26 19:43:20] Dining room | I knew that twenty years ago, Matthew might have shared the same social ideals as them. He had gone to great lengths to join the The Union, he had longed for a prestigious marriage to solidify his position, and in the end, he had become one of the most prominent people in Willowbrook.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:25] Dining Room | I thought, but like any image, the idea of marriage must constantly be nourished by external influences, or it will gradually decay and eventually disappear entirely.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:30] Dining room | I thought of your most fervent desire to insult those who had offended you, but if you were to move to another place and never again hear people speak of him, that enemy would eventually become insignificant in your eyes.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:35] Dining room | I thought back to the beginning, how you had longed to enter the The Union or the French Academy for the sake of certain people. But if you hadn't seen them in twenty years, the prospect of entering such an institution would have lost all its charm.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:40] Dining Room | I know that long-term love, like retirement, illness, or conversion, replaces the old image with a new one.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:45] Dining Room | I thought of Matthew's marriage to John, which did not mean he had given up his social ambitions, because John had already freed him (in a playful sense) from such ambitions, and if he had not yet done so, then he was all the more admirable.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:50] Dining Room | I thought that, in general, the most respected marriages are those considered dishonorable (by \"dishonorable,\" I do not mean a marriage of money: couples united by commercial relations are eventually accepted by the upper class, either because of tradition or precedent, in order to be fair and impartial), because they signify giving up an advantageous position in order to enjoy the pleasures of a purely emotional life.\n[1896-12-26 19:43:55] Dining Room | I thought that, in addition, forming a union with people of different races, such as the Princess or a flirtatious woman, marrying an aristocratic lady or a lowly woman (like the hybridization practiced by Mendelists or described in myths), might bring some pleasure to Matthew, who was an artist—even a depraved one.\n[1896-12-26 19:44:00] Dining Room | I know that whenever he considered marrying John, the only person he worried about was Edward de Fairhaven, and this was not out of mere snobbery. On the contrary, John paid no attention to Edward at all. She did not think of those people who stood high above her in the vast expanse of the sky, but only of those directly above her head.\n[1896-12-26 19:44:20] Dining room | I know that whenever Matthew imagined John as his wife, he always pictured how he would introduce her, especially their daughter, to Princess de Roehm, who had immediately become Edward de Fairhaven after her husband's death. He did not want to take them to any other salons.\n[1896-12-26 19:44:40] Dining Room | I knew he was excitedly imagining how Edward would talk about him to John, and what John would say in return. He imagined that Edward would like Michael, would dote on her, and would make him feel proud of his daughter.\n[1896-12-26 19:45:00] Translation: Dining room | I knew he delighted in imagining the introduction, with every detail meticulously precise, just like a lottery player who carefully considers how he would spend the money he subjectively imagined winning.",

    "text": "[1896-12-26 19:45:20] Dining Room | I know that if the image people imagine when making a decision often becomes the motive for that decision, then one could say that Matthew married John precisely in order to introduce her, her and Michael, secretly to Edward de Fairhaven (so that, if necessary, no one else would ever know).\n[1896-12-26 19:45:40] Dining Room | I know that in the following text, the Stevens will see that Matthew's sole ambition of getting his wife and daughter accepted into high society could not be fulfilled and was firmly rejected; therefore, when Matthew died, he believed that Edward would never meet them.\n[1896-12-26 19:46:00] Dining room | I know that the Marceaux would later see the exact opposite: it was precisely after Matthew's death that Edward and John began their relationship with Michael.\n[1896-12-26 19:46:20] Dining Room | I thought he might be wiser—without getting into the matter of his undue concern over such trivial things—there was no need to be overly pessimistic about the future, to believe that the meeting he longed for would eventually take place, even though he would never live to see it.\n[1896-12-26 19:46:25] Dining Room | I thought about how the law of causality could ultimately produce almost any effect, including those previously considered impossible, and how this law sometimes progresses slowly, slowed down further by Steven's desires—which it desperately tried to speed up, only to achieve the opposite—and by Steven's very existence.\n[1896-12-26 19:46:30] Translation: Dining room | I thought that therefore, it could only be realized when the Stevenes stopped hoping, even stopped living.\n[1896-12-26 19:46:35] Dining Room | I wondered whether Matthew, from his own experience, had not already known this? His marriage to John in his life—foreshadowing what would happen after his death—was like a happiness after death.\n[1896-12-26 19:46:55] Dining Room | I knew he had loved her passionately--if not at first sight--and when he married her, he no longer loved her. The person in him who had so desperately wanted to unite with John for life was already dead.\n[1896-12-26 19:47:15] Dining Room | I saw Steven mention the Count of Willowbrook and ask if he was a friend of Matthew's, because Steven didn't want the conversation to stray from Matthew. I heard, \"Yes, that's right.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:20] Dining Room | I saw Paul turn around and say to Steven. I thought of the blue eyes staring at Steven, this small person, floating with ease in the vastness of his work capacity and ability to absorb.\n[1896-12-26 19:47:25] Dining Room | I saw him then say something to James. \"I heard, 'Oh, Steven has a funny story to tell you, which probably isn't disrespectful toward the prince, whom Steven greatly respects (since Steven's position—though not an official one—means he has no personal relationship with him).\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:30] Dining room | I heard him say, \"It was four years ago, at a small railway station in a Central European country, when the prince happened to see John. Of course, none of his acquaintances dared to ask His Highness what he thought of her; it would have been most improper.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:35] Dining room | I heard that \"however, when her name was occasionally mentioned in conversation, people could discern from subtle but unmistakable signs that the Prince's impression of her was not bad.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:40] Dining Room | I heard James ask, \"Isn't it possible to introduce her to the Count of Willowbrook?\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:45] Dining room | I saw Paul reply. \"I heard him say, 'Hmph! Who knows? The affairs of nobles are hard to tell. Nobles are skilled at demanding recompense, but sometimes they'll risk the whole world just to reward someone's loyalty.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:50] Dining room | I heard, \"Clearly, the Count of Willowbrook has always appreciated Matthew's loyalty, and besides, Matthew is indeed quite amusing.\"\n[1896-12-26 19:47:55] Dining Room | I saw Robert ask, out of courtesy and curiosity. \"I heard, 'And what about your own impression, Paul?'\"\n[1896-12-26 19:48:00] Dining Room | I saw Paul, for once abandoning his usual solemnity, speaking with the enthusiasm of an expert. I heard \"That's the best thing!\"\n[1896-12-27 19:54:47] Dining Room | I thought that the old diplomat knew that acknowledging a strong interest in a woman, and admitting it with a teasing tone, was the most admired form of conversation.\n[1896-12-27 19:54:52] Dining Room | I saw that he suddenly laughed softly, the laughter lasted for a moment, his blue eyes became moist, and the red fine fibers on his nostrils were twitching. I heard \"She's very charming!\"\n[1896-12-27 19:54:57] Dining Room | I saw Steven timidly ask, trying to keep the conversation focused on Matthew. \"I heard, 'A writer named Christopher is also a guest, sir?'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:02] Dining room | I saw Paul answer, and at the same time politely nodded in Steven's direction. I heard, \"Yes. Christopher is also there.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:07] Dining Room | I saw him gaze at Steven with those deep and bright eyes that had once earned Unknown_Bismarck's praise: \"Do you know him?\" I knew that if he wanted to curry favor with James, he would take everything related to James seriously, including the questions raised by a child of Steven's age (a child whose age was rarely respected by others of his generation).\n[1896-12-27 19:55:17] Dining room | I heard Robert say, \"Steven's son doesn't know him, but greatly admires him.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:22] Dining Room | I saw Paul say. \"I heard, 'Oh! Steven wouldn't agree. Christopher is what Steven calls the flutist. One must admit he plays beautifully, but it's overly affected. After all, it's just flute playing, and not of great value.'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:27] Dining room | I thought about how he made Steven doubt his own intelligence, because the most sublime thing in the world, which Steven considered worth a thousand times more than himself, was at the very bottom of his scale of appreciation.\n[1896-12-27 19:55:32] Dining room | I heard him say, \"His works are loose and disorganized, lacking so-called structure. They lack plot, or if they have one, it's too simple. More importantly, they're meaningless. His work has a fundamental flaw, or to put it more directly, it lacks a foundation altogether.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:37] Dining Room | I heard him say, \"In Steven's time, life is becoming increasingly complex, and Steven's generation has little time to read. The situation in Europe has undergone profound changes and may soon experience even greater ones. Steven's generation faces various new threatening issues. In such an era, you would agree with Steven that writers should be different people, not scholars.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:42] Dining room | I heard him say, \"Because the pedant is obsessed with empty and useless discussions about the merits and flaws of pure forms, he makes the Stevenes ignore the constant threat of barbarian invasions—both external and internal.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:47] Dining room | I heard him say, \"Steven knows that this is an affront to the school of 'art for art's sake,' the sacred and inviolable school. But in Steven's time, there are more pressing matters than polishing elegant prose.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:55:52] Dining room | I heard \"Christopher's writing is quite charming, Steven doesn't deny it, but overall it's too artificial, too thin, too lacking in masculinity.\" You're overrating Christopher, but Steven now understands better the few lines of poetry you just showed me.\n[1896-12-27 19:55:57] Dining room | \"I heard 'Steven, there's no need to mention it anymore, since you yourself have admitted it's just childish nonsense (Steven did say that, but he certainly didn't mean it in his heart). After all, one should be lenient towards mistakes, especially those of young people.'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:02] Dining Room | \"I heard, 'In any case, all these faults are not yours alone; during a certain period, it wasn't just you who posed as a poet. However, the piece you showed Steven clearly shows that you've been badly influenced by Christopher.'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:07] Dining room | \"I heard him say, 'You haven't learned anything from him, so you probably won't be surprised, since he's certainly a master of a certain style and technique—though quite superficial—and at your age, you couldn't even grasp the basics.'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:12] Dining Room | I heard, \"But you've already shown the same flaw as him—you arrange forceful phrases in an unreasonable order first, and only then consider their meaning. Isn't that turning things upside down!\"",

    "text": "[1896-12-27 19:56:17] Dining room | \"I heard him say, 'Even in Christopher's work, what is the point of those obscure forms and the tedious phrases of a decadent writer? A writer occasionally lets off a few beautiful fireworks, and everyone immediately cries out that it's a masterpiece. How many masterpieces are there really?\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:22] Dining Room | \"I heard that in Christopher's house, there was not a single novel that was a successful work of high ambition, not a single book worth putting on the shelf to be noticed. Steven didn't read any of them.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:27] Dining Room | I heard him say, \"As for himself, he is far inferior to his work. Ah! A clever man once said that a man is like his writing, but in his case, this is clearly the opposite. He and his work are utterly different.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:32] Dining room | I heard him say that he was solemn, self-important, ill-mannered, sometimes extremely commonplace, and when he spoke to people, he was like a book, not even one of his own, but rather a book one found annoying (because at least his books didn't annoy anyone)—that was the man Christopher.\n[1896-12-27 19:56:37] Dining Room | I heard, \"He is a confused and overly elaborate person, what the previous generation called a show-off, and the way he speaks makes his words repulsive.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:42] Dining Room | I heard Steven say that he didn't remember whether it was Lemaître or Sainte-Beuve who had said that Vigny also had similar unpleasant quirks, but Christopher had never written works as brilliant as \"Samaras\" and \"The Red Seal.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:56:47] Dining Room | I thought of Paul's remarks on the passage Steven had just shown him, which had deeply discouraged Steven. Then Steven remembered how he always felt inadequate whenever he tried to write or engage in serious thought, and once again he felt that he was merely an ordinary man, without any literary talent at all.\n[1896-12-27 19:56:52] Dining Room | I thought of the trivial feelings Steven had once experienced in Sunrise, of how he had read a work by Christopher, probably precisely these that had led Steven into a state of reverie that seemed quite valuable, and his prose poems were merely a reflection of this state.\n[1896-12-27 19:56:57] Dining Room | I thought the ambassador was keen-sighted, and he could have immediately seized upon the beauty that Steven had found in a completely false illusion and exposed it, yet he did not do so. Instead, he let Steven understand how insignificant Steven was (Steven being objectively evaluated from the outside by the kindest and most intelligent expert).\n[1896-12-27 19:57:02] Dining room | I thought of Steven feeling despondent; since Steven's fortunes had taken a turn for the worse.\n[1896-12-27 19:57:07] Dining Room | I thought of Steven's mind like a fluid, its volume determined by the capacity provided by others. In the past, it had swelled, filling the vast container of genius to the brim; now it had shrunk, suddenly closed off and restricted by Paul into a narrow, mediocre space.\n[1896-12-27 19:57:12] Dining Room | I saw him turn back and say to James. I heard about Steven's meeting with Christopher, which was an awkward situation for both of them—and also a kind of amusing incident in another way. A few years ago, Christopher went on a trip to Vienna, where Steven was then the ambassador. Princess Metternich introduced him to Steven, and he came to the embassy hoping that Steven would invite him.\n[1896-12-27 19:57:17] Dining room | I heard, \"Since Steven is a French diplomat, and since his work brings some honor to France—perhaps in a very minor way—Steven naturally can set aside his dissatisfaction with Steven's private life.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:57:22] Dining room | \"I heard that 'however, he wasn't traveling alone, so he asked Steven to invite his girlfriend as well. Steven wasn't the type to act proper, and since Steven had no wife, he could certainly open the embassy's doors a bit wider.'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:57:27] Dining room | I heard that \"Steven couldn't stand this shamelessness, it was revolting, because in his work he talked about virtue, even went so far as to lecture people. His books were filled with endless, even tedious analyses, which Steven's friends would say were either painful concerns, sickly regrets, or long-winded sermons triggered by trivial matters (Steven's friends knew how much it was worth). On the other hand, in his private life, he was so frivolous, so indifferent.\"\n[1896-12-27 19:57:32] Dining Room | I heard that in the end Steven didn't answer him. The princess came back to Steven again, but Steven still didn't agree. So Steven figured that the man didn't have a good opinion of him. Steven didn't know what to make of Matthew's kind gesture of inviting both of them. Or may be it was he himself who had suggested it to Matthew, which was hard to say, since he was actually ill. It was even his only excuse.\n[1896-12-27 19:57:37] Living room | I saw Steven take the opportunity to ask Paul this question as he left the dining table for the drawing room. I heard, \"Is John's daughter also here?\" I knew that this was easier to conceal Steven's excitement than if he had remained motionless at the table, under the strong light.\n[1896-12-27 19:57:42] Parlor | I saw Paul seem to struggle to recall for a moment, then he said. \"I heard 'Yes, a girl of about fourteen or fifteen? That's right. Steven remembers that someone introduced her to Steven before dinner, saying she was the host's daughter. No, she didn't stay long. She went to bed early, or may be to her friend's house—Steven can't remember for sure. It seems you know a lot about the Matthew family.'\"\n[1896-12-27 19:57:47] Living room | I heard that Steven often went to the Champs-Élysées with Michael, who was very nice.\n[1896-12-27 19:57:52] Parlor | I heard him say, \"Ah, I see! Indeed, Steven also finds her charming. But to speak honestly, she'll probably never measure up to her Robert. That remark shouldn't hurt your passionate feelings, should it?\"\n[1896-12-27 19:57:57] Parlor | I heard that Steven preferred Michael's face, of course Steven also appreciated her Robert. Steven often went to the Bois de Boulogne just to run into her.\n[1896-12-27 19:58:02] Parlor | I heard, \"Ah! Steven is going to tell them everything, and they'll be delighted.\"\n[1896-12-28 06:25:30] Parlor | I thought of Paul saying those words, his attitude being the same as everyone else's (though only for a short time).\n[1896-12-28 06:25:35] Parlor | I thought that when these people heard Steven say that Matthew was a clever man, that his parents were respectable brokers, and that his house was beautiful, they would assume that Steven would speak in the same way about the same clever man, the same respectable brokers, and the same beautiful house.\n[1896-12-28 06:25:40] Parlor | I thought that, in a way, it was like a normal-minded person talking to a madman without yet realizing that the other was mad.\n[1896-12-28 06:25:45] Parlor | I thought that Paul considered it perfectly natural to be attracted to beautiful women, and that when someone excitedly spoke to you about a certain lady, you were supposed to pretend that he had fallen in love, tease him about it, and promise to help him.\n[1896-12-28 06:25:50] Drawing room | I thought that, therefore, this important person would speak to Michael and her Robert about Steven (Steven would become a flowing breeze like the gods of Olympus, or transform into an old man like Minerva, secretly entering John's salon, attracting her attention, occupying her thoughts, making her grateful for Steven's praise, and considering Steven a friend of the important person, thus inviting Steven and making him a close friend of her family). He would use his high authority in John's eyes to help Steven.\n[1896-12-28 06:25:55] Parlor | I saw Steven and felt an overwhelming excitement, almost kissing his soft, pale, wrinkled hands as if they had been soaked in water for too long.\n[1896-12-28 06:26:00] Parlor | I saw Steven almost make that gesture, thinking that the observer was only Steven. I realized that it is no easy task for each of the Stevenes to accurately judge the social standing of their words and actions in the eyes of others.\n[1896-12-28 06:26:05] Parlor | I thought that Stevenes fear being seen as too self-important, and that they assume the many memories from people's lives already occupy such a large space in them, so the minor aspects of their behavior and speech would hardly enter the consciousness of the person they are talking to, let alone remain in their memory.",

They often altered what they had said afterward, thinking that no one could contradict them.\n[1896-12-28 06:26:15] Parlor | I thought that, even with regard to the thousand-year history of humanity, the philosophy that foretells that everything will be preserved might be more truthful than the philosophy of the columnist who believes everything will be forgotten.\n[1896-12-28 06:26:20] Parlor | I know that on the same Willowbrook newspaper, the didactic editorialist, writing about some major event, a great work, and especially a \"fashionable\" female singer, would say: \"Who will remember these ten years from now?\" Yet on the third page, reports from the College of Ancient Literature often discuss an unimportant fact, a poem written during the time of the pharaohs, which is still known today but has little real value— isn't that the case?\n[1896-12-28 06:26:40] Parlor | I thought that perhaps it was not entirely so for a brief life.\n[1896-12-28 06:26:45] Living room | I knew that, several years later, Steven met Paul at someone's house, where Paul happened to be a guest. Steven regarded him as the most powerful support he could possibly encounter, since he was a friend of James, kind-hearted and helpful. Moreover, he was cautious in his speech due to his profession and background.\n[1896-12-28 06:27:05] Parlor | I saw, but as soon as the ambassador had left, someone told Steven that he had mentioned the previous dinner party and said that he had \"seen Steven trying to kiss his hand.\" I thought of Steven and couldn't help blushing. The way Paul spoke about Steven and the details he recalled left Steven stunned, so far removed from what Steven had imagined!\n[1896-12-28 06:27:15] Parlor | I thought about this \"idle chatter\" and how it made Steven realize how unexpected the proportions of distraction, concentration, memory, and forgetting are in the human mind, something that amazed Steven just as much as when he first read in a book by Mésnil that people actually had an exact list of the hunters invited by King Assurbanipal of the tenth century BCE to join his hunt!\n[1896-12-28 06:27:20] Living room | I heard Steven say, \"Ah, sir, if you do this, if you speak of Steven to John, Steven will be forever grateful and will serve you for the rest of his life!\" when Paul announced he would convey Steven's admiration to Michael and her mother.\n[1896-12-28 06:27:25] Living room | I heard, \"But Steven wants to tell you that Steven and John have never met, and no one has ever introduced Steven to her.\"\n[1896-12-28 06:27:30] Drawing room | I thought that Steven had said those last words just to prevent the other person from thinking he was boasting about a non-existent friendship. But as soon as the words left his mouth, Steven felt they were useless, because his enthusiastic expression of gratitude had already cooled him down from the very beginning.\n[1896-12-28 06:27:35] Living room | I saw Steven seeing the ambassador's face show hesitation and dissatisfaction. I saw a drooping, narrow, crooked look in his eyes (like a diagonal line in a stereogram that recedes into the depth of a particular surface).\n[1896-12-28 06:27:45] Parlor | I thought that what it was looking at was merely the invisible interlocutor within himself, and their conversation was one that the gentleman—Steven—who had been speaking with him all along could not hear.\n[1896-12-28 06:27:50] Living room | I thought that Steven's words—though weak compared to the torrent of gratitude surging in Steven's heart—might move Paul and prompt him to help Steven (which would be effortless for Paul, yet would greatly please Steven), but Steven immediately realized that the opposite occurred, and even the harsh words of someone who opposed Steven could not have had such an effect.\n[1896-12-28 06:27:55] Living room | I thought of Steven and a stranger exchanging pleasant impressions of passersby, both seeming to agree that they were vulgar. But suddenly, a pathological chasm appeared between Steven and the stranger, who carelessly touched his pocket and said, \"Bad luck, Steven didn't bring a gun, or none of them would have survived.\"\n[1896-12-28 06:28:00] Parlor | I thought of situations similar to this: Paul knew that meeting John, visiting her, was the most ordinary and simple thing in the world, yet Steven regarded it as an unattainable goal, and there must be some great, unspeakable difficulty involved.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:05] Parlor | I thought that, therefore, when he heard Steven's words, he must have believed that behind the apparently normal wish Steven expressed, there was surely some other thought, some suspicious motive, some previous fault, which was why no one had yet been willing to greet John on Steven's behalf, because that would have made her unhappy.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:10] Living room | I realized then that Steven would never do this favor for Steven. He could meet John every day for year after year, and still never— not even once— mention Steven.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:15] Parlor | I know that a few days later, he found out something Steven wanted to know from her, and he had James pass the information along to Steven. Naturally, he saw no need to mention who had asked.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:35] Parlor | I thought she wouldn't know that Steven knew Paul, nor would she know that Steven was passionately longing to go to her house.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:40] Drawing room | I thought perhaps it wasn't as unlucky as Steven imagined. Even if she knew both points, the second wouldn't enhance the first, and the effectiveness of the first was already unreliable, since for John, whose life and home did not provoke any mysterious turmoil, those who met and visited her were certainly not the magical figures Steven had imagined.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:45] Drawing room | I thought that if it were possible, Steven would have wanted to carve the words \"Steven knows Paul\" onto a stone and then throw it through the window of Matthew's house. Steven believed that, despite the crude method of delivery, the message would inspire the lady of the house with respect rather than aversion toward Steven.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:50] Drawing room | I thought that, in fact, if Paul accepted Steven's commission, it would have no effect at all, and instead would only cause Matthew's family to develop a dislike for Steven.\n[1896-12-28 06:28:55] Drawing room | I thought that even if Steven understood this, he would lack the courage to withdraw the commission (if the ambassador readily agreed), and lack the courage to give up his pleasure (no matter how tragic the consequences): that is, to let Steven and Steven's name accompany Michael for a moment in her home and life, where she was unfamiliar with him.\n[1896-12-28 06:29:00] Home | I saw Paul leave, and then James looked through the newspaper. I thought of Steven and also of Arthur.\n[1896-12-28 06:29:05] Home | I thought that since the pleasure Steven experienced while watching the play was far less than he had originally expected, this pleasure had to be supplemented and unconditionally absorbed every possible nourishment. For example, the virtues of Arthur praised by Paul were eagerly swallowed by Steven, as if a parched field immediately absorbed the water poured over it.",

    "text": "[1896-12-28 17:31:33] Home | I saw that at this moment, James handed the newspaper to Steven, pointing to a small article on it. I saw that the performance of \"Phedre\" was a tremendous success, with all the leading figures from the art world and the critics coming to see it. The actress who played Phedre, the renowned Arthur, achieved an unprecedented success in her brilliant career. This performance truly was a major event in the theatrical world, and our newspaper will provide a detailed report. For now, it is sufficient to note that authoritative critics unanimously agreed that this performance gave new life to the character of Phedre, one of Racine's most beautiful and profound creations, and that it became the purest and most remarkable artistic performance that people of our time have had the privilege to witness.\n[1896-12-28 17:31:43] Home | I heard Steven exclaim, \"What a great artist she is!\" I thought of \"the purest and most outstanding artistic performances,\" and once this new concept entered Steven's mind, it drew close to the incomplete pleasure Steven felt in the theater, slightly filling its lack, and this convergence formed something incredibly exciting.\n[1896-12-28 17:31:48] Home | I thought that people might believe Steven's words were not entirely sincere. Steven, for his part, might consider the situation of many writers: they are dissatisfied with their just-completed work, but if they speak about an article praising Chateaubriand's genius, or if they think of some great artist they have taken as a model, then the idea of genius fills their minds. Therefore, when they look back at their own works, they impose this notion of genius upon them, and thus no longer see them as they were originally; they even come to believe in their value.\n[1896-12-28 17:31:53] Home | I thought to myself, why don't the Stevenes ask themselves: if all these concepts live together in their minds, then among those concepts that make them happy, isn't each one first of all like a parasite, drawing the strength it lacks from neighboring, different concepts?\n[1896-12-28 17:31:58] At home | I saw that James no longer mentioned Steven's \"diplomatic career.\" I thought that Robert seemed somewhat dissatisfied. Steven believed that what she regretted was not Steven's abandoning diplomacy, but rather his choosing literature, because she was most concerned with imposing a structured life on Steven's erratic moods.\n[1896-12-28 17:32:03] At home | \"I won't say anything more,\" James said loudly. \"First of all, you have to have an interest in what you're doing. Besides, he's not a child anymore; of course he knows what he likes, and it's probably hard to change. He knows what happiness is in his life.\"\n[1896-12-28 17:32:08] Home | I thought about whether my future life would be happy or not, but that was aside for the moment. That evening, Steven was troubled by his father's sudden words that allowed Steven to make his own decisions. The father's unexpected kindness often made Steven want to rush forward and kiss his father's red, healthy face above his mustache, but he refrained from doing so only out of fear of making him unhappy.\n[1896-12-28 17:32:13] Home | I thought of Steven as a writer who, since his fantasies were his own creation, seemed to him of little value, yet the publisher had chosen the finest paper for them, which made him feel uneasy. Steven was no different; he asked himself whether his desire to write was really so important that it warranted James wasting so much kindness on it?\n[1896-12-28 17:32:18] Home | I thought about what he had said—that Steven's interests would not change, that Steven's life would be happy—and these words led to two very painful assumptions about Steven. The first was that Steven's life had already begun, and furthermore, the things that would happen in the future would not differ much from those that had already occurred.\n[1896-12-28 17:32:23] At home | I thought of the second hypothesis: that Steven was not outside of time, but rather subject to its laws, just like a fictional character. And precisely because of this, when Steven sat under the willow arbor in Sunrise reading their biographies, he felt an intense sorrow.\n[1896-12-28 17:32:28] Home | I thought of what James had just said, \"He is no longer a child, his interests won't change,\" and so on. These words made Steven suddenly see the Steven in time, and Steven felt the same sorrow. Although he was not yet an elderly man in a nursing home, his mind already seemed to have become a character in a novel.\n[1896-12-28 17:32:33] Home | At that moment, James, fearing that Steven might blame the guests, spoke up first to Robert. I heard him say, \"Steven admits that old Paul, as you put it, is a bit stuffy. He just said it would be improper to ask the Count of Willowbrook, and Steven was really afraid you'd laugh out loud.\"\n[1896-12-28 17:32:38] Home | \"I don't know where you're going with this,\" Robert replied, \"Steven likes him. It's rare for someone so high up and so old to still have such childlike innocence. That shows he's honest and well-mannered.\"\n[1896-12-28 17:32:43] Home | I saw James raising his voice; he was pleased that Paul had received Robert's praise, and he wanted to prove that he was even better than she imagined. \"I heard him say, 'It's not bad. But it doesn't affect his alertness and intelligence, something Steven knows best—he's completely different on the committee.' How did he put it... 'It's hard to say about the nobles' affairs...'\"\n[1896-12-28 17:32:48] Home | \"I heard, 'Yes, exactly. Steven noticed too; he's very perceptive, obviously his life experience is extensive.'\"\n[1896-12-28 17:32:53] Home | I heard him say, \"Strange, he actually went to John's house for dinner, and even met up with decent people, civil servants. Where did John get these people from?\"\n[1896-12-28 17:32:58] At home | I heard, \"Didn't you notice his witty remark? 'Seems like it's mainly men going there.'\"\n[1896-12-29 00:43:02] Home | I saw that both of them tried to recall the tone in which M. de Paul had said this, as if recalling the intonation of Bressant or Dilon when they performed \"The Female Adventuress\" or \"Monsieur Proulx's Son-in-Law.\" I know that the highest praise for M. Paul's wording came from Françoise. Many years later, whenever people mentioned the ambassador calling her \"the head chef of the first rank,\" she would still laugh.\n[1896-12-29 00:43:22] Home | I knew that when Robert went to the kitchen to convey this title to her, it was as if a minister of defense were delivering a royal salute after inspecting a visiting monarch.\n[1896-12-29 00:43:32] At home in the kitchen | I saw Steven go to the kitchen before Robert, because Steven had asked the peace-loving but cruel Françoise to make sure the rabbit didn't suffer too much when it was killed; Steven went to the kitchen to check on how things were going.\n[1896-12-29 00:43:37] Home kitchen | I heard Françoise tell Steven that everything had gone smoothly, briskly: \"Steven has never before encountered an animal like this. It died without a sound, as if it were mute.\"\n[1896-12-29 00:43:42] Home kitchen | I heard that Steven knew very little about animal sounds, so I said that a rabbit's cry was softer than a chicken's. François was angry at Steven's ignorance and said, \"Don't jump to conclusions yet. You should check whether a rabbit's cry is really softer than a chicken's. Steven says it's much louder than a chicken's.\"\n[1896-12-29 00:43:47] Home kitchen | I thought of Françoise, who, when receiving Paul's praise, wore an air of proud and composed dignity, her eyes bright and intelligent—though if only for a moment—as if she were an artist listening to someone speak of her art.\n[1896-12-29 00:43:52] Home kitchen | I knew that Robert had sent her to several big restaurants to apprentice in cooking. That evening, she referred to the most famous restaurants as small eateries. I thought Steven would be very pleased, just as he had been when he once discovered that the hierarchy of quality among dramatic artists did not correspond to their hierarchy of reputation.",

When she spoke of Paul, she did so in a familiar tone. I heard, \"He's a good old man, just like Steven.\" I knew because he had called her \"the head.\"\n[1896-12-29 00:44:22] Home kitchen | I knew that when he arrived, she had wanted to peek, but she knew Robert hated people peeking from behind doors or under windows, and she would find out through other servants or the concierge that Françoise had peeked.\n[1896-12-29 00:44:42] At home in the kitchen | I knew, therefore, she just glanced through the kitchen window—\"to avoid having to explain to the mistress\"—and when she saw Paul's general appearance and his \"skillful\" posture, she \"really thought it was M. Thomas,\" even though the two men had nothing in common.\n[1896-12-29 00:44:47] At home in the kitchen | I heard Robert ask her, \"Who could make broth as delicious as yours (when you're willing to make it)? What's the reason for that?\"\n[1896-12-29 00:44:52] In the kitchen at home | I heard Françoise say, \"Steven doesn't even know where it came from.\" I knew part of what she said was true, because she was not good at— or unwilling to— reveal the secret of her frozen juice or cream.\n[1896-12-29 00:44:57] Home kitchen | I heard her say, when talking about the big restaurant: \"Their fire is too strong, and they cook the dishes separately. The beef must be as soft as a sponge in order to absorb all the broth. Still, there was once a café where the cooking was good. Steven wasn't saying their sauce was exactly the same as Steven's, but they did cook it over low heat, and there was indeed cream in the flan.\"\n[1896-12-29 00:45:02] Home kitchen | I saw James approaching Steven and asked, \"Is it Henry's Restaurant?\" I knew he greatly appreciated the restaurant at the Place de l'Étoile and often went there for meals with his colleagues.\n[1896-12-29 00:45:07] At home in the kitchen | \"I heard 'Oh, no!' said Françoise, her gentle voice hiding deep contempt. 'Steven was talking about a small restaurant. Henry's is certainly upscale, but it's not a restaurant—it's a soup shop!\"\n[1896-12-29 00:45:12] Home kitchen | \"I heard, 'So it's the Weber Restaurant?'\"\n[1896-12-29 00:45:17] In the kitchen at home | \"I heard 'Oh no, Steven means a good restaurant. The Weber is on King's Street, and it's not a restaurant, it's a hotel. Steven doesn't know if they serve meals, he thinks they don't even have tablecloths. They just throw everything on the table, carelessly.\"\n[1896-12-29 00:45:22] In the kitchen at home | I heard, \"Is it the Clos de L'Épée?\"\n[1896-12-29 00:45:27] Home kitchen | I saw Françoise smile slightly. I heard him say, \"Well, as for the flavor, Steven mainly caters to society ladies. Of course, young people need that sort of thing.\" I knew that for Françoise, the upper class referred to women like courtesans.\n[1896-12-29 00:45:32] In the kitchen at home | I thought of Steven and others realizing that although Françoise appeared simple-minded, she was a formidable \"colleague\" for top chefs, and she was no less envious and self-important than the most arrogant actresses.\n[1896-12-29 00:45:37] Home kitchen | I heard her say again, \"No, the restaurant Steven mentioned used to serve a few popular, delicious dishes. The front is also quite large now. It used to be very busy, making a lot of money.\" I thought that the Stevenes felt she had the right attitude toward her craft, that she respected tradition.\n[1896-12-29 00:45:42] At home in the kitchen | I heard, \"Madame knows this restaurant, on the main street, on the right side, a bit to the back...\"\n[1896-12-29 00:46:02] At home in the kitchen | I knew that the restaurant she spoke of with this fairness—mingled with pride and innocence—was the Café Anglais.\n[1896-12-29 06:07:51] Street | I saw that New Year's Day had arrived. Steven and Robert went to visit relatives. I knew she was worried about tiring Steven, so she had divided the people we were going to visit into groups according to regions, not according to family ties, just as James had drawn the route.\n[1896-12-29 09:46:38] Distant cousin's house | I saw the Stevenes go to visit a distant cousin (she lived not far from the Stevenes, so it made sense as a starting point), but as soon as the Stevenes stepped into the living room, Robert became anxious and uneasy. I knew that because a suspicious uncle's friend was there eating sugared chestnuts or chestnuts filled with nuts. I thought he would definitely tell Uncle Steven that the first visit wouldn't be to him, and Uncle's pride would be hurt.\n[1896-12-30 00:42:47] Champs-Élysées Street | After the visit ended (David had spared Steven and his friends from visiting her because they were going to have dinner at her place that day), Steven ran all the way to the shop on the Champs-Élysées and asked the female owner to deliver a letter to the servant from the Matthew family who came several times a week to buy spiced honey bread.\n[1896-12-30 00:42:52] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that ever since the day Michael had made Steven very sad, Steven had decided to write her a letter on New Year's Day, telling her that the old friendship between us had ended along with the past year, and that Steven's complaints and disappointments were now in the past.\n[1896-12-30 00:42:57] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that from January 1st, Steven's group would establish a new kind of friendship, one that would be extremely solid, impervious to anything, and very beautiful. Steven hoped that Michael would take great care of it, keeping it forever beautiful, and that if any danger threatened it, she would inform Steven immediately, just as Steven had promised to tell her.\n[1896-12-30 00:43:02] Corner of King Street | I saw that on the way home, Françoise made Steven stop at a street corner on Rue Royale, where there was an open-air stall. She picked out a few photos of Pope Pius IX and Lassalle as New Year's gifts, while Steven bought a photo of Arthur. I thought of the actress's single, unchanging face, which seemed impoverished in comparison to the myriad praises she inspired. It was like a garment on a person without clean clothes—unvarying and worn out.\n[1896-12-30 00:43:07] Corner of Wangjia Street | I thought that, by itself, this face did not make Steven feel beautiful, yet Steven felt the urge and desire to kiss it, because it must have received countless kisses, and because, on the \"photo card,\" it seemed to be calling to Steven with a coquettish tenderness and an affected innocent smile.\n[1896-12-30 07:39:26] In front of the column of the theater poster | I saw the dusk descend, and Steven stopped in front of the circular poster at the theater, gazing at the poster announcing Arthur's performance on January first. I saw the breeze was moist and gentle, a kind of weather Steven was very familiar with.\n[1896-12-30 07:39:36] In front of the column of the theater poster | I thought that Steven felt, sensed, that New Year's Day was no different from any other day; it was not the first day of a new world—in that new world, Steven would have the chance to rediscover Michael as in the days of creation, as if nothing had ever happened before, as if the disappointments he sometimes felt from her and the signs that foretold the future simply did not exist.\n[1896-12-30 07:39:41] In front of the column of the theater poster | I thought that in this new world, everything from the old one had vanished completely... except for one thing: Steven hoped to be loved by Michael. Steven understood that since Steven's heart wished to rebuild the world that had never satisfied it, that meant his heart had not changed, because Steven believed Michael's heart could not have changed either.\n[1896-12-30 07:39:46] In front of the column with the theater poster | I thought of Steven, who saw new friendships and old ones as no different, just as the new year and the old year are not separated by a chasm. The wishes of Steven and his kind could neither control nor change time; they could only give it a different name, unaware that time itself did not know of their change.\n[1896-12-30 07:39:51] In front of the column with the theater poster | I saw the breeze fluttering the advertising column. I thought of Steven, who didn't know that it was called New Year's Day, and who ended, as Steven was used to, in the dusk. Steven recognized it, and again felt that common eternal substance of past time, its familiar dampness and its ignorant, fluid quality.\n[1896-12-30 07:39:56] Home | I thought of Steven returning home, Steven who had just celebrated New Year's Day as an old man; the difference between the old and the young is not merely that they no longer receive New Year's gifts, but that they no longer believe in New Year.\n[1896-12-30 07:40:01] Home | I thought about New Year's gifts; Steven did receive some, but not the one gift that would have truly made Steven happy—the letter from Michael.",

The festive noise that continued on the street until late at night kept Steven awake.\n[1896-12-31 09:11:11] My bedroom at home | I thought of Steven, of all those who would spend the night in joy, of Arthur's lover or that gang of libertines, who must have gone to find Arthur after the performance (the very performance Steven had seen on the poster).\n[1896-12-31 09:11:16] My bedroom at home | I thought of this idea, which made Steven even more restless during sleepless nights. To calm himself, Steven wanted to tell himself that Arthur might not have thought about love, but he couldn't bring himself to say it.\n[1896-12-31 09:11:21] My bedroom at home | I saw Steven light the extinguished candle so he could look at her face again. I thought that at this moment it was probably being caressed by men, who gave her and took from her extraordinary and vague pleasures (which Steven could not prevent).\n[1896-12-31 09:11:26] My bedroom at home | I saw the horn's sound coming from a small inn, without any poetry. I thought this fantasy caused Steven a more cruel excitement than pornography, a longing that grew deeper in the sound of the trumpet; more melancholy than \"Evening, deep in the woods...\"\n[1896-12-31 09:11:31] My bedroom at home | I thought that at this very moment, Michael's letter might not be what Steven needed. In the confused lives of people, various desires interfere with each other, so happiness rarely falls upon the very wish that longs for it.\n[1897-01-01 07:03:48] Champs-Élysées Street | When the weather was fine, Steven still went to the Champs-Élysées. I saw the delicate pink houses along the street displayed beneath a changing and light sky, because at that time watercolor exhibitions were all the rage.\n[1897-01-01 07:03:58] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that if Steven had said at the time that he had already considered Gabriel's building more beautiful than the surrounding ones, and belonging to a different era, that would have been a lie. At that time, Steven had thought the industrial palace, at least the Trocadéro Palace, was more distinctive, perhaps even more ancient.\n[1897-01-01 07:04:03] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought of Steven's youth, immersed in an unsettled and restless sleep, so that the entire neighborhood he saw in his sleep seemed like a dream. Steven had never imagined that King Street actually had an eighteenth-century building.\n[1897-01-01 07:04:08] Champs-Élysées Street | The only time I recall Steven staring at Gabriel's building for a long time was when night had fallen, and the columns had lost their tangible outlines in the moonlight, appearing like cardboard, reminding Steven of the scenery in the operetta Orpheus in the Underworld, and it was then that Steven first experienced beauty.\n[1897-01-01 07:04:13] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought about how Michael had never returned to the Champs-Élysées, and Steven needed to see her, because even her face, Steven could no longer remember.\n[1897-01-01 07:04:18] Champs-Elysées Street | I thought of how Stevenes looked at the people they loved with an inquisitive, anxious, and demanding attitude, waiting for a word that would either give them hope for their appointment the next day or take it away. And before that word arrived, Stevenes would simultaneously or alternately imagine joy and disappointment. Because of this, when Stevenes faced the person they loved, their attention was trembling and unable to form a clear image of her (or him).\n[1897-01-01 07:04:23] Champs-Élysées | I thought that Steven had indeed forgotten Michael's face, except for that magical moment when she had smiled at Steven—because Steven only remembered her smile. Since he could not see that dear face, Steven tried desperately to recall it, but in vain.\n[1897-01-01 07:04:28] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought of Steven, furious, coming upon two useless and astonishing faces, which were etched with extreme precision into Steven's memory: the man who tended the carousel and the woman who sold malted candy.\n[1897-01-01 07:04:33] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw her finally return, spending almost every day playing with Steven. I thought of Steven, who every day hoped to gain something new from her—something new that would come from her. In this sense, Steven's love was renewed every day.\n[1897-01-02 08:35:28] Champs-Élysées Street | I remember once when Steven told her how much he admired her parents, she looked in a vague, reserved, and secretive way, and suddenly said. I heard, \"You know, they don't even look at you!\"\n[1897-01-02 08:35:33] Champs-Elysées Street | I saw her then laugh like a slippery water spirit (this was her habit). I often saw her laughter was extremely discordant with her words, like music sketching another invisible surface on a different plane.\n[1897-01-02 08:35:43] Champs-Élysées Street | I knew that Mr. and Mrs. Matthew had not asked Michael to stop playing with Steven, but they hoped—she thought—that nothing had actually happened.\n[1897-01-02 08:36:03] Champs-Élysées Street | I knew they didn't like her associating with Steven, believing that Steven was of low character and could only have a bad influence on their daughter. Matthew thought Steven belonged to that type of shameless young man.\n[1897-01-02 08:36:23] Champs-Élysées Street | I knew that in his mind, such men hated the parents of the girls they loved; although they were overly polite to them in person, behind their backs they would laugh at them with the girl, encouraging her to ignore their words, and once the girl was theirs, they even forbade her from seeing her parents again.\n[1897-01-02 08:36:43] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought of the feelings in Steven's heart, which stood in sharp contrast to this image (no one, not even the most despicable person, would ever view himself in such a way). Steven was filled with intense feelings for Matthew, and Steven believed that if Matthew had the slightest awareness, he would regret his misjudgment of Steven, as though it were a wrongful conviction!\n[1897-01-02 08:36:48] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven, with great courage, write about his feelings for him in a long letter, asking Michael to deliver it to him. She agreed.\n[1897-01-02 08:36:58] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought, but alas! To Steven's surprise, he actually believed that Steven was a greater hypocrite. The genuine feelings that Steven so honestly described in his sixteen pages of letter were met with his suspicion. Steven's passionate and sincere letter, just like the passionate and sincere words Steven had spoken to Paul, had no effect at all.\n[1897-01-02 08:37:03] Champs-Elysées Street | The next day, I saw Michael lead Steven behind a large cluster of laurel bushes on the path, where it was quiet. Steven and she each chose a chair and sat down, and she told Steven. I heard her James shrug as he read the letter: \"All of this is meaningless, and only proves that Steven was right.\"\n[1897-01-02 08:37:08] Champs-Élysées Street | I became even more angry, thinking about Steven's pure motives and kind heart. How could Steven's words have failed to touch even the tiniest hair of Matthew's absurd mistake! He was certainly wrong, and Steven was absolutely certain of it.\n[1897-01-02 08:37:13] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that since Steven had described certain undeniable characteristics of his own generous feelings so precisely, and yet Matthew still could not immediately recognize Steven's feelings from these characteristics and ask Steven to forgive his mistake, it must be because Matthew himself had never experienced such a noble feeling, and therefore could not understand how someone else could feel that way.\n[1897-01-02 08:37:18] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that perhaps Matthew knew that generosity was merely the internal form that the selfish feelings of the Stevenes took before they were categorized and named, and perhaps he considered Steven's liking for him simply as a simple effect of Steven's love for Michael (and the affirmation of that passion), such that all of Steven's future actions would inevitably depend on this love, not on the reverence it generated for him.\n[1897-01-02 08:37:23] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought Steven would never agree with his prophecy, because Steven still couldn't separate his love for Steven from Steven himself, still couldn't estimate the consequences from an experimental point of view. Steven became discouraged and disheartened.",

    "text": "[1897-01-03 13:18:25] Public Toilet Kiosk | I saw Steven have to leave Michael for a moment because Françoise was calling him. Steven had to go with her to the small pavilion with green metal netting. I saw it was very like the old, disused tollbooths that used to stand in Willowbrook, and not long ago they had built inside it a lavatory, which the English call a \"lavatory,\" and the French, in their half-understanding pursuit of English fashions, called a \"vétérinaire.\"\n[1897-01-03 13:18:35] Public Toilet Kiosk | I saw Steven waiting in the porch for Françoise. I smelled the cool, damp moldy odor coming from the moist and old walls.\n[1897-01-03 13:18:45] Public Toilet Kiosk | I thought of how this scent made Steven immediately forget the worries that Matthew's message to Michael had brought, and filled Steven with pleasure—not that kind of pleasure that makes Steven more unstable, hard to hold on to and control, but rather the opposite: a reliable, solid pleasure that was beautiful, calm, rich, and enduring.\n[1897-01-03 13:18:50] Public Toilet Kiosk | I thought how Steven longed, as he used to when going for a walk to Fairhaven, to seek out the charm of this intense feeling, to remain motionless there and question that old scent, which invited Steven to delve into its undisclosed truth, rather than simply enjoy the pleasures it offered him.\n[1897-01-03 13:18:55] Public Toilet Kiosk | I saw her just then, the owner of the small pavilion, an old woman with heavy makeup and a reddish-brown wig, speaking to Steven.\n[1897-01-03 13:19:05] Public restroom booth | I knew that Françoise said her family was \"quite good,\" because her daughter had married a \"young man from a wealthy family,\" who was as different from the workers as Saint-Simon thought Samuel was from people of lower birth.\n[1897-01-03 13:19:25] Public Toilet Booth | I knew, of course, that the landlady had probably had a difficult life before taking up this trade, but Françoise was certain she was from Charles, belonging to the Saint-Léonard family.\n[1897-01-03 13:19:45] Public Toilet Kiosk | I saw this Charles Steven not to stay in the cold, even opening a door for Steven. I heard, \"You don't want to go in? This one's very clean. You don't have to pay.\"\n[1897-01-03 13:19:50] Public Toilet Kiosk | I thought she was probably doing it just like the girl at the Gouache candy shop, or like that cunning old woman who sold flowers. When Robert was choosing flowers for the \"flower bed,\" this woman would wink at Steven while handing him a rose.\n[1897-01-03 13:19:55] Public Toilet Kiosk | I thought that, in general, if \"Charles\" liked boys and opened the doors of stone chambers where men crouched like sphinxes, then in this act of generosity she was not seeking an attempt at corruption, but rather the pleasure of being generous to the one she loved without expecting anything in return.\n[1897-01-03 13:20:00] Public Toilet Booth | A moment later, I saw Steven saying goodbye to \"Charles\" with Françoise, and then Steven left Françoise to go find Michael.\n[1897-01-04 11:52:13] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven discover her sitting on a chair behind the orange blossom bushes. I knew it was to avoid being seen by her companions, who were playing hide-and-seek.\n[1897-01-04 11:52:23] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven go over and sit beside her. She pulled her soft hat down low over her forehead, almost covering her eyes, as if peering secretly. I thought of the first time Steven saw her in Sunrise, with that dreamy, sly look.\n[1897-01-04 11:52:28] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven ask her if there was a way for Steven and her father to talk face to face. She said she had already mentioned it to her father, but he thought it was unnecessary. \"I heard, 'Take it, take your letter, Steven has to go find his companions, since they can't find Steven.'\"\n[1897-01-04 11:52:33] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Michael lying back in her chair, calling to Steven to take the letter but not handing it to him. So Steven leaned closer, and Steven felt the strong pull of her body, and Steven said. \"I heard, 'Come on, don't let Steven get ahead of you, see who's better.'\"\n[1897-01-04 11:52:38] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw her hiding the letter behind her back. Steven lifted the braid hanging over her shoulders and reached to the nape of her neck.\n[1897-01-04 11:52:48] Champs-Élysées Street | I knew she wore her hair in long braids, perhaps because it suited her age, or perhaps because Robert wanted to prolong her daughter's childhood so that she herself would seem younger.\n[1897-01-04 11:53:08] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw the Stevenes fighting, hunched over. Steven was trying to pull her toward him, but she was resisting.\n[1897-01-04 11:53:18] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw her flushed cheeks, red and round like cherries, from the effort of laughing; she smiled as if Steven were tickling her.\n[1897-01-04 11:53:28] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven hold her tightly between his legs, as if trying to climb a small tree.\n[1897-01-04 11:53:38] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that in this struggle, Steven's heavy breathing came mainly from physical exertion and his enthusiasm for the game, just as sweat dripped from his body due to exhaustion. Steven was sweating out his joy, barely pausing even to savor it.\n[1897-01-04 11:53:43] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven snatch the letter right away. So Michael gently said to Steven. \"I heard, 'You know, if you're willing, the Stevenes could fight again for a while.'\"\n[1897-01-04 11:53:48] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought perhaps she vaguely sensed that Steven had another, unspoken purpose in playing this game, but she didn't realize that Steven's aim had already been achieved.\n[1897-01-04 11:53:53] Champs-Élysées Street | I agreed to continue the fight when I saw Steven, so she wouldn't think Steven had any other purpose, and now that the letter was in her hands, Steven just wanted to sit quietly. I thought of Steven, who feared she might suspect (a moment later, she made a movement of restrained and modest indignation, showing that Steven's fear was not unfounded).\n[1897-01-04 11:53:58] On the way home | I saw that on the way home, Steven suddenly noticed, suddenly remembered. I thought of the cool, slightly sooty scent of the small pavilion with its metal netting, which brought Steven close to an image that had previously been hidden, yet did not allow Steven to see it or recognize it.\n[1897-01-05 14:32:16] On the way home | I knew this image was Uncle Adolphe's small room in Sunrise, and it gave off the same dampness.\n[1897-01-05 14:32:36] On the way home | I wondered why the memory of such an insignificant figure could make Steven so happy, but Steven didn't understand it, and for now, he didn't want to.\n[1897-01-05 14:32:41] On the way home | At this thought, Steven felt that Paul's contempt for him was indeed justified: first, the writers whom Steven considered the best in his eyes were merely \"pipe-players\" in Paul's view; second, the true passion that Steven felt did not come from any great idea, but from a kind of moldy smell.\n[1897-01-05 22:44:28] Paris | I knew that for some time now, in certain families, whenever guests mentioned the name Champs-Élysées, the mothers would look unimpressed, as if the person standing before them were a famous doctor whom they had seen misdiagnose too many times to trust anymore.\n[1897-01-05 22:44:48] Paris | I know that it's said the Champs-Élysées Gardens are unlucky for children; more than once, children have had sore throats, measles, and many have had fevers.\n[1897-01-05 22:45:08] Location: Paris | I knew several of Robert's friends were puzzled by her continued decision for Steven to go to the Champs-Élysées; although they did not openly question her motherly love, they at least felt sorry for her recklessness.\n[1897-01-05 22:45:28] Paris | I thought that people with neurasthenia might be among the very few who do not \"listen to their inner self,\" although this contradicts the general view.\n[1897-01-05 22:45:33] Paris | I knew they heard many things in themselves, and later realized there was no need to be so startled, so they simply stopped listening.\n[1897-01-05 22:45:53] Paris | I know their nervous systems often scream \"Help!\" as if their lives are in danger, when really it's only because it's about to snow or they're moving house. Over time, they've become accustomed to ignoring all warnings.",

    "text": "[1897-01-05 22:46:13] Location: Paris | I know, just like a dying soldier, driven by the fervor of battle, ignores the warnings and continues to live for a few days as if he were healthy.\n[1897-01-06 11:02:55] The dining room at home | One day, I saw Steven enter the dining room with his usual array of discomforts (which he ignored just as he always did, treating them with the same indifference as he did his circulation). He sat down at the table where my parents were already seated. I thought to myself, as I usually did, that feeling cold didn't necessarily mean I should seek warmth, but rather that I had been scolded; not feeling hungry indicated that it would rain, and not that I didn't need to eat.\n[1897-01-06 11:03:00] The dining room at home | I saw it, but when Steven took the first bite of the delicious steak, a wave of nausea and dizziness made him stop. I saw this as the restless answer to an illness that had just begun.\n[1897-01-06 11:03:10] Dining room at home | I saw Steven using a cold, indifferent demeanor to conceal and delay the symptoms, but the illness stubbornly refused to allow him to eat, making it impossible for Steven to swallow. At that moment, Steven thought that if others found out he was sick, they wouldn't let him go out, and this thought (like a wounded soldier's instinct) gave Steven courage.\n[1897-01-07 04:25:25] The bedroom at home | I saw Steven wobbling back to the bedroom, took his temperature and found he had a fever of forty degrees. Then I got dressed and went to the Champs-Élysées.\n[1897-01-07 10:12:55] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that although Steven's physical body was weak and lifeless, his mind was smiling and urging Steven to rush toward the sweet joy of playing hide-and-seek with Michael.\n[1897-01-07 10:13:00] Champs-Élysées Street | I thought that in an hour, Steven's body would no longer hold out, but I still felt the happiness of being with her, still had the strength to enjoy the joy.\n[1897-01-07 21:47:55] Home | When I got home, Françoise told everyone that Steven was feeling unwell, probably suffering from a fever, and immediately sent for the doctor. I heard the doctor declare that the \"extremely\" high fever caused by \"pulmonary congestion\" was merely a \"straw fire,\" which would turn into a more \"dangerous\" and \"latent\" form.\n[1897-01-07 21:48:00] Home | I knew that for a long time Steven had been feeling suffocated. David thought Steven was suffering from alcohol poisoning, but the doctor, despite her objections, advised Steven to drink a bit of beer, champagne, or brandy when he felt an attack coming on, in addition to the caffeine that helped him breathe more easily.\n[1897-01-07 21:48:20] Home | I saw that, in order to get wine from David, Steven could not hide it anymore, but had to try to show that Steven was having difficulty breathing. I knew that he said the \"comforting effect\" caused by alcohol would prevent asthma attacks.\n[1897-01-07 21:48:30] Home | I thought about how whenever Steven felt he was about to fall ill, and when the illness was unpredictable, he would become anxious.\n[1897-01-07 21:48:35] At home | I thought of Steven's body--perhaps because it was too weak to bear the secret of the illness alone, or perhaps because he was afraid that others, not knowing Steven was about to fall ill, would ask him to do something beyond his ability or even dangerous--which made Steven feel that he had to accurately tell his grandmother about his discomfort, and this precision eventually became a physiological need.\n[1897-01-07 21:48:40] Home | I thought about how whenever Steven noticed a symptom he hadn't yet identified, he had to tell David, or else his body would become restless. If she pretended not to notice, Steven's body would force him to persist.\n[1897-01-09 08:32:56] Home | I sometimes saw Steven going too far. I saw on that dear face, which no longer restrained itself as it used to, an expression of compassion and painful cringing.\n[1897-01-09 08:33:06] Home | I saw how painful it was for her, and Steven felt terribly upset. He threw himself into her arms, as if Steven's kiss could erase her pain. I thought that Steven's love could bring her as much joy as Steven's happiness.\n[1897-01-09 08:33:11] Home | I thought that since she now knew how unwell Steven was, Steven would feel relieved, and Steven's body would no longer object to Steven comforting her.\n[1897-01-09 08:33:16] Home | I saw Steven repeatedly saying that this discomfort was not painful, that she didn't need to feel sorry for Steven, and Steven assured her that Steven was happy.\n[1897-01-09 08:33:26] Home | I thought that Steven's body simply wanted to be pitied, that it was enough for others to know that it ached on the right side; it didn't object to Steven saying that this ache wasn't a cause of illness and didn't hinder Steven's happiness. It didn't boast of philosophy, which had nothing to do with it.\n[1897-01-10 13:30:27] Home | I knew that even before fully recovering, Steven would have several episodes of suffocation almost every day.\n[1897-01-11 01:42:47] My bedroom at home | I saw that one evening, David left Steven in good health, but later that night she came back to check on him and found him breathing rapidly; she was terrified and cried out. I heard, \"Ah! Steven's sky, how much you've suffered!\"\n[1897-01-11 01:42:57] The bedroom at home | I saw her leave immediately, and the door made a noise. Soon she came back with brandy she had just bought, since there was no wine at home.\n[1897-01-12 04:53:28] Bedroom at home | I saw David's face slightly flushed, her expression somewhat uneasy, her eyes showing tiredness and discouragement. I thought that soon Steven would feel relieved.\n[1897-01-12 04:53:33] The bedroom at home | I saw her say, \"Steven, just go away and let you be at ease,\" and then she suddenly left Steven.\n[1897-01-13 20:16:28] The bedroom at home | I saw but Steven still kissed her. I saw Steven, and I noticed that her fresh cheek was slightly damp—was it the moisture left by the night air she had just crossed?\n[1897-01-13 20:16:38] My bedroom at home | I thought that Steven would never know.\n[1897-01-13 20:16:43] Home bedroom | I saw her come to Steven's bedroom only the next day, until it got dark, and they said she had to go out during the day. I thought that Steven felt she was being cold toward him, but Steven restrained himself from reproaching her.\n[1897-01-18 18:25:31] Home | I saw that the congestion had already been cured, but Steven still felt short of breath. Why was that? My parents then called in Professor Godard.\n[1897-01-18 18:25:41] Home | I thought that for a doctor called in such a situation, mere knowledge was not enough.\n[1897-01-18 18:25:46] Home | I knew that the symptoms he was facing could belong to one of three or four different diseases, and in the end, it would be his sense of smell and his eyesight that would determine which one it was, although the outward signs were almost identical.\n[1897-01-18 18:26:06] Home | I thought that this mysterious talent did not mean having superior intelligence in other areas. A person who liked the worst paintings, the worst music, and had no spiritual aspirations at all could perfectly well possess this talent.\n[1897-01-19 22:33:23] Home | I knew that, in Steven's case, the specific symptoms he had observed could have multiple causes: neural spasms, early-stage tuberculosis, asthma, intestinal toxin-induced respiratory distress accompanied by renal insufficiency, chronic bronchitis, or a syndrome resulting from a combination of several of these factors.\n[1897-01-19 22:33:43] Home | I knew that the way to deal with a nervous spasm was to pay no attention to it, but for tuberculosis one had to be very careful, following an overfeeding regimen. However, overfeeding was extremely harmful for joint diseases such as asthma; and the diet required for intestinal toxic respiratory distress was deadly for tuberculosis patients.\n[1897-01-19 22:34:03] Home | I saw, but Professor Godard hesitated only briefly before announcing the prescription in an unchallengeable tone. I heard, \"Strong diarrhea. Only milk allowed for a few days. No meat. No alcohol.\"\n[1897-01-19 22:34:08] Home | I heard Robert muttering that Steven needed nourishment, that Steven was already quite nervous, and that such a severe illness and poor diet would bring Steven down.",

I thought Steven had realized that he was questioning whether what he had just said had been too much a product of his gentle nature, and that he was trying to recall whether he had forgotten to put on his cold mask (as if people search for a mirror to check whether they've forgotten their tie).\n[1897-01-21 02:41:20] Home | I saw that he was doubtful and wanted to make amends slightly, so I spoke in a rough voice. I heard, \"Steven never repeats prescriptions. Give Steven a pen. Only milk to drink.\"\n[1897-01-21 02:41:25] Home | \"I heard, 'Once Steven and the others have solved their breathing difficulties and insomnia, you can have soup. Steven doesn't mind having some mashed potatoes again, but you must keep drinking milk, drink milk. That will make you happy, since Spain is the latest fashion, ah! Ah!'\" I knew (his students were familiar with this wordplay, because every time he told heart patients or liver patients to eat mainly milk, he would always say that.)\n[1897-01-21 02:41:30] Home | I saw and then he said, \"Then you can gradually return to normal life. However, if coughing and shortness of breath return, you just repeat the process: laxatives, enema, bed rest, milk.\"\n[1897-01-22 06:49:07] Home | I saw him coldly listening to Robert's final objections, then dismissing them without reply, unwilling to explain why he had chosen this treatment, and he took his leave.\n[1897-01-22 06:49:17] Home | I saw my parents preventing Steven from trying it. I thought that my parents believed this treatment would not only fail to cure Steven's illness but also unnecessarily weaken Steven even more.\n[1897-01-22 06:49:22] Home | I saw that they certainly tried not to let the professor know they hadn't followed his instructions, and to be absolutely certain, they avoided all social places where they might meet the professor.\n[1897-01-22 06:49:32] Home | I saw that later, when Steven's condition grew increasingly severe, they finally decided to strictly follow Professor Gaudet's prescription. Three days later, Steven no longer had difficulty breathing, nor did he cough; his breathing became smooth again.\n[1897-01-23 06:59:55] Home | I know he cleansed Steven's liver and kidneys, clearing his bronchial passages so that Steven could breathe, sleep, and regain his strength. I thought, so the Stevenes understood that Professor Godard saw Steven's main illness as poisoning (although he later said he also thought Steven had asthma, especially a bit \"mad\"). So the Stevenes understood that this fool was an outstanding doctor.\n[1897-01-23 07:00:00] Home | I saw Steven finally get up. But they no longer let Steven play on the Champs-Élysées, it was said that the air there was bad.\n[1897-01-24 22:06:49] At home | I thought that Steven saw it as just an excuse not to let him see Michael, so Steven forced himself to keep saying Michael's name constantly, like a prisoner trying to preserve his native tongue so as not to forget the homeland he would never see again.\n[1897-01-24 22:06:54] Home | I saw Robert sometimes touch Steven's forehead with her hand. \"I heard, 'Well, the younger son no longer tells his troubles to Robert?'\"\n[1897-01-24 22:06:59] Home | I heard Françoise say every day as she approached Steven: \"Look at the master's color! You haven't looked in the mirror, have you? You look like a corpse!\"\n[1897-01-26 06:56:05] Home | I knew that if Steven had only caught a cold, Françoise would have worn the same sorrowful expression. I thought this sadness was more due to her \"status\" than to Steven's illness. At that time, Steven couldn't tell whether Françoise's pessimism was born of pain or satisfaction; for the moment, he considered it to be social and professional in nature.\n[1897-01-26 06:56:10] Home | One day, after the postman had come, Robert placed a letter on Steven's bed. Steven opened it carelessly.\n[1897-01-26 06:56:20] Home | I thought that because there couldn't possibly be the one signature that would make Steven happy—the signature of Michael, with whom Steven had no other contact besides meeting her on the Champs-Elysées.\n[1897-01-26 06:56:25] Home | I saw a silver seal at the bottom of the letter, depicting a knight in a helmet and the motto \"Pre viam rectam\" arranged in a circle below.\n[1897-01-27 08:17:38] Home | I noticed the handwriting in the letter was bold, each sentence seemed to be in a heavy font, because the crossbar of the \"t\" was not drawn in the middle, but on top, as if drawing a line under the corresponding character from the previous line.\n[1897-01-27 08:17:53] Home | I saw that the signature at the bottom of the letter was exactly Michael's.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:08] Home | I thought, after all, since Steven believed there could be no signature of hers in the letter he had received, Steven didn't trust his own eyes, nor did he feel any joy.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:13] Home | I saw that, in an instant, the signature made everything around Steven lose its reality. This incredible signature played a game of tag with Steven's bed, fireplace, and walls at a dizzying speed. Everything before Steven's eyes began to sway, as if Steven had fallen off his horse.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:18] Home | I thought of Steven, who was considering whether there might be another kind of life, entirely different and even the opposite of the life he was familiar with, yet real. When it suddenly revealed itself to Steven, he was filled with hesitation, like the resurrected figures in the sculptor's \"Last Judgment\" standing at the gates of heaven.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:23] Home | I heard you were seriously ill and no longer go to the Champs-Élysées. Steven also doesn't go there anymore, because there are many sick people there.\"\n[1897-01-27 08:18:28] Home | I heard that \"Steven's girlfriends come to his house every Monday and Friday for tea. Robert told Steven to tell you that you're welcome to come when you're better, and Steven and his friends can continue their interesting conversations on the Champs-Élysées.\"\n[1897-01-27 08:18:33] At home | I heard: \"Goodbye, dear friend, but I hope your parents will allow you to come often to Steven's house for tea. With regards, Michael.\"\n[1897-01-27 08:18:38] Home | I thought about how, when reading the letter, Steven's nervous system received the information with remarkable agility—that Steven had encountered a happy event. Yet Steven's mind, that is, Steven himself—the main party involved—was unaware of it.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:43] Home | I thought about happiness, about obtaining it through Michael, which was something Steven had always longed for, a purely intellectual matter, just as Leonardo said that painting is \"cosa mentale.\" A page full of words could not be immediately absorbed by the mind.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:48] Home | I saw that after Steven read the letter, he thought of it constantly, couldn't stop reading it every five minutes, and kissed it again and again. Whenever I thought of it, it became the object of Steven's reverie, a cosa metale. Thus, Steven came to know Steven's happiness.\n[1897-01-27 08:18:53] Home | I thought that life is full of miracles that lovers can always count on. This miracle, too, might have been artificially created by Robert, who, seeing that Steven had found life dull lately, had someone ask Michael to write a letter to Steven.\n[1897-01-28 14:07:58] Home | I know that Steven remembers his first few seawater baths. At that time, Steven hated the sea because he couldn't breathe properly. To spark Steven's interest in diving, Robert secretly had Steven's swimming instructor place beautifully unusual shells and coral branches on the ocean floor, so that Steven would think he had discovered them himself.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:18] Home | I thought to myself that, after all, in life, in various different situations, matters of love are best not tried to understand, because they are sometimes severe and merciless, sometimes unexpected, as if governed by magical laws rather than rational ones.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:23] Home | I know a billionaire--although wealthy, he's a very nice man--who was abandoned by a plain, poor woman with whom he lived. In his despair, he used all the power of his money and every influence in the world to win her back, but it was all in vain. I thought that in such a situation, the Stevenes would be better off not trying to explain logically why his mistress was so stubborn, but rather accept that he was destined to suffer this blow, destined to die of a broken heart.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:28] Home | I thought that lovers often had to fight against obstacles, and their imagination, heightened by pain, guessed where those obstacles lay.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:33] Home | I thought that the obstacle sometimes lay simply in some special quality of the woman who could not be won over, in her foolishness, in the influence of certain people she did not know or the fears she felt, in the temporary pleasures she demanded from life, pleasures that the lover himself or his wealth could not provide.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:38] Home | I thought that, in any case, a lover could not understand the nature of these obstacles, because women would manipulate him by hiding things from him, and because his judgment was blinded by love and unable to make an accurate assessment.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:43] Home | I thought of these obstacles as tumors, which the doctor finally managed to reduce, but without understanding their cause. Like tumors, the obstacles remained mysterious, yet they were only temporary.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:48] Home | I thought, after all, they usually last longer than love. Since love is not a selfless passion, once it fades, lovers no longer wonder why the woman they once loved, poor and frivolous, stubbornly and for a long time refused his support money.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:53] Home | I thought that in matters of love, mystery prevented Stevenes from seeing the causes of their disasters, and also prevented them from understanding sudden, complete endings—such as the one brought about by Michael's letter.\n[1897-01-28 14:08:58] Home | I thought that for this kind of feeling, any satisfaction was merely a shift of pain, and thus could only be called a seemingly happy ending, not a truly happy one. Sometimes, the Stevenes were given temporary relief, and for a while, they would have the illusion of being healed.\n[1897-01-30 00:42:32] Home | I saw Françoise not believing that was Michael's name. I saw that because the letter G was very ornate, it leaned slightly over the following letter i, which was omitted a bit, making it look like the letter A, and the final syllable was drawn out long, forming a jagged flourish.\n[1897-01-30 00:42:37] At home | I thought that if one had to find a logical explanation for the friendly attitude expressed in the letter, which filled Steven with such joy, one might say that, in a way, it was due to this illness (in contrast to Steven's original belief that it would make him forever unfavored in the eyes of the Matthew family).",

    "text": "[1897-01-30 00:42:42] Home | I saw that not long before, Richard had come to see Steven, when Professor Goald was in Steven's bedroom (Steven had again invited him back since he had adopted his dietary treatment).\n[1897-01-30 01:56:24] Home | After the doctor finished his visit, Professor Goedel didn't leave but was instead persuaded by his parents to stay for a meal. At that moment, Richard entered Steven's bedroom. Steven and the others were talking, and Richard said that the night before, he had dined with a woman who was very close to John.\n[1897-01-30 01:56:29] Home | I thought about how he had heard that John liked Steven, and how Steven would have wanted to say that he must have made a mistake, and tell him that Steven had never met John, had never spoken to her, in order to set the record straight, just as Steven had done before to be honest and not let John think he was lying to Paul.\n[1897-01-30 01:56:34] Home | I thought that although Steven lacked the courage to correct Richard's mistake, Steven understood that it was done on purpose. The fact that he invented words John could never have said was meant precisely to show that he had dined with John's girlfriend (he considered this proper, though it was a fabrication).\n[1897-01-30 01:56:39] Home | I knew that, at first, when Paul learned that Steven didn't know John and wanted to meet her, he had made up his mind not to mention Steven in front of her.\n[1897-01-30 01:56:59] Home | I knew, but on the contrary, Professor Gourdaud learned from Richard that John was familiar with Steven and appreciated him, and he made up his mind that when he saw her next (he was her private physician), he would tell her that Steven was a likable boy, as they often had contact.\n[1897-01-30 01:57:19] Home | I knew these words were of no benefit to Steven, but they would add to his appearance, and it was for this double reason that he decided, the moment he saw John, to speak of Steven.\n[1897-01-31 01:48:07] Swann's house | I saw that Steven had become acquainted with the house. I smelled the fragrance of John's perfume lingering on the stairs, but the more intense aroma came from Michael's life, radiating a unique and painful charm.\n[1897-01-31 08:21:57] At Swann's front door | I saw that when Steven asked him if he could go upstairs, he always lifted his hat politely, indicating his approval of Steven's request. I thought of the merciless gatekeeper transformed into the compassionate Omenides.\n[1897-01-31 14:55:47] Outside Swann's House | I saw that from the outside, the windows seemed to have a bright, cold, and superficial gaze (just like Matthew's), keeping Steven apart from the precious interior things not meant for him.\n[1897-01-31 15:00:00] Swann's house | In fine weather, Steven and Michael spent the whole afternoon in her room, and sometimes Steven himself would open the window to let in some fresh air.\n[1897-01-31 21:29:47] Swann's house | Every time it was Robert's day to receive guests, the Stevenets could even lean against the window to watch the visitors arrive. When they got out of their carriages, they often looked up at Steven and waved, mistaking him for a nephew of the mistress of the house.\n[1897-01-31 21:29:57] Swann's house | I saw that at this moment, Michael's braid brushed against Steven's cheek. I saw these extremely delicate (both natural and supernatural) artistic strands of hair, which, in Steven's view, were an unparalleled work made from the grass of heaven.\n[1897-01-31 21:30:07] Swann's house | I thought even the smallest lock of hair was worth Steven's keeping as a sacred grass in heaven.\n[1897-01-31 21:30:12] Swann's house | I saw how Steven groveled before Matthew's friends, even before the photographer, in order to get such a photo, but Steven didn't manage to obtain it and instead attracted the attention of some unpleasant people. I thought about it, but Steven didn't dare to dream so boldly; Steven only wanted a photograph, which would be a hundred times more precious than a copy of the little flower painted by Leonardo!\n[1897-01-31 21:30:17] Swann's house | I knew that Michael's parents had long forbidden Steven from seeing her, and now—Steven entered the dim waiting room, where he might meet them at any moment. I thought that this waiting was more terrifying and more urgent than the courtly audiences people used to have at Versailles.\n[1897-02-01 23:45:08] Swann's house | I saw Steven bump into a huge coat rack that looked like the seven-branched candelabrum from the Bible, then clumsily greet the servant in a gray ro be who was sitting on a wooden crate, because in the dim light Steven had mistaken him for John.\n[1897-02-01 23:45:18] Swann's house | I saw that whenever Steven went there, one of the two would pass by and smile (without any trace of resentment) and shake hands with Steven, saying. \"I heard 'How have you been?' (when they said this, they never elide the t, so you can imagine how Steven would happily practice omitting the liaison when he got home). Does Michael know you're here? Well, have fun yourselves.\"\n[1897-02-03 02:00:19] Swann's house | I thought of Michael's tea parties, which had long seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle causing Steven and his friends to drift apart, but which now had become an opportunity for them to reunite.\n[1897-02-03 02:00:24] Swann's house | I knew she often left notes to inform Steven (since the Stevenes were still new acquaintances), and each time the stationery was different.\n[1897-02-03 02:00:44] Swann's house | I once saw a letter with a blue poodle printed on it, followed by some humorous English text and an exclamation mark; another time, the paper had a ship's anchor or the letters G.S., stretched out to form a rectangle that occupied the entire top part of the page.\n[1897-02-03 02:00:59] Swann's house | I saw it once more, with the name Michael printed in gold at the corner of the letter, as if it were her signature, then a floral flourish, with a black umbrella opened at the top. Another time, the name was enclosed within a decorative font resembling a Chinese hat, all the letters in uppercase, yet you couldn't recognize a single one.\n[1897-02-04 04:15:34] Swann's house | I saw that although Michael had a wide variety of stationery, it would inevitably run out. So after a few weeks, Steven saw the same kind of paper used for her first letter, with a faded silver seal, a helmeted knight, and the motto beneath it. I thought at the time that Steven had chosen the paper according to some custom, selecting different ones for different dates. Now it seems she did this in order to remember which papers she had already used, so as not to send the same paper to a correspondent--at least to those she wanted to please--again, and even if she had to repeat, she would try to delay the repetition as much as possible.\n[1897-02-04 04:15:39] Swann's staircase | I saw Michael's girlfriend who had come for tea. Because of their different class schedules, some had just arrived while others were already leaving. Steven could already hear the muffled voices coming from the waiting room as he was on the stairs.\n[1897-02-04 04:15:49] Swann's staircase | I thought of how, before Steven even reached this floor, it had suddenly severed his connection with his past life, making him forget all about taking off his scarf when he entered the warm room, checking the time, and not missing his way home.\n[1897-02-04 04:15:54] Swann's staircase | I saw that the entire staircase was made of wood, and at the entrance there was a sign that read: \"Elevator use prohibited when descending.\" I knew this style was common in certain houses built in the Henry II style at the time, a style that had been John's long-standing ideal but that she would soon abandon.\n[1897-02-04 04:16:09] Swann's staircase | I heard Steven tell his parents that it was an ancient artifact brought by Mr. Matthew from afar. I thought how strange this staircase must seem to Steven.",

    "text": "[1897-02-04 04:16:14] Home | I thought of Steven, who loved truth so much that even if he knew this information was false, he would unhesitatingly tell his parents, because only in this way could they come to respect the noble staircase of the Matthew family as Steven did.\n[1897-02-04 04:16:19] Home | I thought it was like this: it's best not to admit that a famous doctor, whose genius is unknown to an ignorant man, can't cure a stuffy nose. Moreover, Steven has no powers of observation and often can't even name or identify what he's looking at; he only knows that things connected with the Matthew family are special, so Steven doesn't think he's lying when talking about the artistic value and distant origin of this staircase.\n[1897-02-04 14:37:40] Home | I didn't necessarily see him lying, but it was likely a lie, because when James interrupted Steven, Steven's face turned red. He said. I heard, \"Steven knows those houses. Steven has visited one. They're all the same, except that Matthew's house has several floors, all built by Bailleux.\"\n[1897-02-04 14:37:45] Home | I know he also said he had considered renting a place, but then gave it up because the design wasn't very reasonable, and the foyer was too dark. That's what he said.\n[1897-02-04 14:38:05] Home | I thought, but Steven's instinct told Steven that he should sacrifice his thoughts for the charm of the Matthews and for his own happiness. Therefore, Steven ignored what his James had said, obeyed the command of his heart, and resolutely cast aside this destructive idea—that the Matthews' house was nothing more than an ordinary house that Steven and his kind might have also lived in, just like a devout believer would reject Renan's Life of Jesus.\n[1897-02-05 03:34:48] Swann's Staircase | Every time I went for tea, Steven climbed the stairs one by one, arriving at the district that smelled of John's perfume. I thought of Steven, who had lost his mind and memory, and had become nothing more than a tool for conditioned reflexes.\n[1897-02-05 06:10:16] Swann's house | I thought of Steven, as if he had already seen the imposing chocolate cake, and the circle of dishes surrounding it holding small pastries, along with the patterned gray satin napkins, all of which were the distinctive customs of the Matthew family.\n[1897-02-05 18:12:47] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw this fixed, unchanging world, like Kant's necessary world, as if it depended on a supreme act of freedom. Because when the Marceaux were all in Michael's small parlor, she suddenly looked at the clock and said. \"I heard, 'Ah, Steven's lunch is already disappearing, and dinner won't be until eight o'clock. Steven is really hungry. What do you think?'\"\n[1897-02-05 18:12:57] Swann's living room | I saw her lead Steven and the others into the living room, which was as dark as the inner sanctum of an Asian temple in a Rembrandt painting. I saw a large cake that imitated the structure of a building, it was solemn, gentle, and friendly, as if it had been casually and by chance erected there, waiting only for Michael to take down its chocolate crenels and dismantle the brownish steep walls, these slopes had been made in the oven, as if they were pillars from the palace of Darius.\n[1897-02-05 18:13:07] Swann's living room | I saw that Michael was not only deciding whether to destroy this cake, which was as big as Nineveh, according to her own hunger, but also asking Steven if he was hungry, while handing him a large wall of gleaming, oriental design, embedded with bright red fruits, from the collapsed structure.\n[1897-02-05 18:13:12] Swann's living room | I thought of how she even asked Steven when his parents were having dinner, as if Steven still had a sense of time, as if Steven's bewildered panic hadn't completely erased the feeling of hunger, the idea of dinner, and the image of family from Steven's empty memory and paralyzed stomach.\n[1897-02-05 18:13:17] Swann's living room | I watched Steven eat the cake numbly; in a little while, it would be digested. I thought that unfortunately this paralysis was only temporary. But it was too early yet.\n[1897-02-05 18:13:27] The living room of Swann's house | At that moment, Michael handed Steven his tea. Steven kept drinking it, though one cup would have been enough to keep Steven awake for twenty-four hours. I know that's why Robert often said, \"What a bother, this child, always getting sick after coming back from Matthew's.\"\n[1897-02-05 18:13:32] Swann's living room | I thought, but when Steven was at Matthew's house, did Steven realize that he was drinking tea? Even if Steven did realize it, he would still drink it anyway, because even if Steven momentarily regained his ability to distinguish the present, he could not recover his memory of the past or his foresight of the future.\n[1897-02-05 18:13:37] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of Steven's imagination, which could not reach the distant time—only then would Steven have the thought to sleep and the need for sleep.\n[1897-02-05 18:13:42] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw that some of my girlfriends weren't even drinking tea! I thought that not all of Michael's girlfriends were in this state of excited irrationality.\n[1897-02-06 05:29:30] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw her mess up the chairs by the table to dilute the solemn atmosphere. I heard Michael say, in the fashionable phrase of the time, \"Of course, Steven's tea was a failure!\" and then added, \"It's like Steven is celebrating a wedding or something. Good heavens, those servants are really stupid!\"\n[1897-02-06 05:29:35] Swann's Small Living Room | I saw her sitting sideways on a chair with X-shaped legs, eating a cake.\n[1897-02-06 05:29:45] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw that after a moment, John hurried in. I knew she had just seen off her guests—the day of her reception and Michael's tea party often fell on the same day.\n[1897-02-06 05:29:55] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw her sometimes wearing a blue velvet dress, and often a black satin gown with white lace trim.\n[1897-02-06 05:30:10] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw her express surprise (as if, without her permission, the daughter could have so many little snacks). I heard her say, \"Ah, you're eating so deliciously. Seeing you eat cake has even made Steven jealous.\"\n[1897-02-06 05:30:15] Swann's small living room | \"I heard, 'Okay, Robert, Steven, they're asking you to come too.' Michael answered.\n[1897-02-06 05:30:20] Swann's small parlor | \"I heard, 'Oh no, darling, what would Steven's guests say? There's Madame Bontemps, Professor Gaudin's wife, and Madam Boncourt, you know, dear Madam Boncourt never makes brief visits, and she's just arrived. What will these nice people say when they see Steven not coming back?\"\n[1897-02-06 05:30:25] Swann's small living room | I heard, \"Once they're gone, if there's no new customer, Steven will come and chat with you (it's much more interesting for Steven).\"\n[1897-02-06 05:30:30] Swann's Small Living Room | \"I heard 'Steven thought Steven had the right to be a little quiet, since Steven had already received forty-five guests, and out of them, forty-two had talked about Cézanne's paintings!'\"\n[1897-02-06 05:30:35] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw her speaking as she walked away to attend to her guests. I heard her then say to Steven, \"When will you come for tea with Michael? She'll make the tea you like, the kind you often drink in your little studio.\"\n[1897-02-07 07:24:07] Swann's small living room | I thought she seemed to believe that Steven, too, was aware that entering this mysterious world was a matter of seeking some habit (even if Steven drank tea, was that considered having a tea-drinking habit? As for \"the studio,\" Steven didn't know whether he had one or not)?\n[1897-02-07 07:24:12] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I heard her say again, \"When will you come back? Tomorrow? The Stevenes will make you toast, just like the ones from the Gourmand Bakery. You won't come? You're really mean.\"",

I thought that since Steven had never seen toast or the Gourmande pastry shop, her final promise didn't really move Steven.\n[1897-02-07 07:24:22] Swann's Small Sitting Room | It struck me as strange that when she praised Steven's nurse, Steven at first didn't know who she meant, though everyone used that word, and perhaps it was still in use in Sunrise today. Steven didn't understand English, but he soon realized she was talking about Françoise.\n[1897-02-07 07:24:27] Swann's small parlor | I knew that on the Champs-Élysées, Steven had worried that Françoise might make a bad impression. I thought, but Steven had learned from John that it was precisely because Michael had spoken so much about Steven's nurse that the Matthews had taken a liking to Steven.\n[1897-02-07 07:24:32] Swann's small parlor | I heard, \"You can feel how faithfully she is to you, how good she is.\" I thought of Steven, who immediately completely changed his view of Françoise. Due to the reaction, Steven no longer considered the governess in a raincoat and feathered hat as indispensable.\n[1897-02-07 07:24:37] Swann's small living room | I couldn't help but make a few remarks about Madame Boulanger, saying that she was indeed a kind woman, but her visits were frightening. I realized then that Steven understood their relationship was not as advantageous for Steven as he had imagined, and it did nothing to improve his position in Matthew's house.\n[1897-02-07 07:24:42] Swann's house | I thought that if Steven had approached this fairyland, which had unexpectedly opened its doors to him, with reverence and the thrill of joy, then his identity was merely that of Michael's friend.\n[1897-02-07 07:24:47] Swann's Waiting Room | When I saw them meet Steven face to face in the waiting room, shake hands with him, and then go off toward that mysterious kingdom. I thought of Steven's kingdom, which itself lay within an even more mysterious realm where the Matthews lived a supernatural life.\n[1897-02-08 06:43:11] Swann's house | I saw, for example, that when Michael was not at home and Mr. or Mrs. Matthew happened to be there, they would ask who was ringing the bell, and upon hearing it was Steven, they would have the servant invite Steven in for a chat, hoping that Steven might influence their daughter in this way or that, on this matter or that.\n[1897-02-08 06:43:21] Swann's house | I thought of Steven's letter to Matthew, which had been so comprehensive and convincing, yet he had considered it not worth a reply.\n[1897-02-08 06:43:26] Swann's house | I found myself thinking about Steven, and couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy: thoughts, reasoning, and even the heart are incapable of initiating any conversation, incapable of solving any difficulty. Yet life, without you even understanding how, easily resolves all difficulties.\n[1897-02-08 06:43:31] Swann's house | I thought of Steven acquiring this new identity as Michael's friend, which gave him the ability to have a positive influence on her. Therefore, Steven was given special treatment, just like a boy who is a classmate of the king's son, always ranking first in school, and because of this coincidence, he could often visit the palace and be received by the king in the audience hall.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:02] The study of M. Swann | I saw Matthew kindly letting Steven enter his study, as if he wasn't in a hurry to deal with all those glorious and honorable tasks. He kept Steven for an hour.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:12] Swann's Study | I saw Steven forced to stammer out an answer, sometimes timidly remaining silent, sometimes mustering a fleeting courage to respond incoherently. I thought Steven was too excited, so I couldn't understand a word he was saying.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:17] The study of M. Swann | I saw him pointing out to Steven the artworks and books he thought would interest Steven. I thought that although Steven had no doubt they were far more exquisite than the collections in the Valleyview and the National Library, Steven could not see them.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:22] The study of M. Swann | I thought that if his steward now had Steven hand over the watch, the tie pin, and the high-top leather shoes, and sign the document acknowledging him as heir, Steven would readily agree, because, to put it bluntly in a folk saying: Steven was completely confused.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:27] Swann's Study | I thought about the visit, which continued, and Steven was surprised that the time spent in this magical house had left him with nothing, achieving no satisfactory result.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:32] Swann's Study | I realized that Steven's disappointment wasn't due to any flaw in the masterpiece I showed him, but rather because the magical feeling he experienced while sitting in Matthew's study wasn't caused by the inherent beauty of the objects themselves, but by the special emotions—sadness and sweetness—that were attached to them.\n[1897-02-08 10:24:37] The study of M. Swann | I thought of how, for years, Steven had poured his emotions into this study, and even now, it was still saturated with the essence of the room.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:15] Swann's Corridor | I saw a lackey in shorts tell Steven that the lady wanted to see him, so Steven went through the winding corridors to John's bedroom. I saw there the precious fragrance drifting continuously from the distant dressing room.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:20] Odette's bedroom | I saw three beautiful and dignified women, her first, second, and third maids, smiling as they dressed her.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:25] Odette's bedroom | I saw there a large collection of mirrors, silver brushes, and statues or portraits of Saint Anthony of Padua made by her friends, famous artists. I thought of Steven lingering there for a moment, feeling ashamed of himself and yet grateful toward her, and these feelings had nothing to do with those objects.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:30] Swann's house | I saw John return to her guest, but Steven and the others still heard her laughing and chatting. I thought of how, even when there were only two people in front of her, she would speak loudly as if addressing a large group of \"companions,\" just as she had done before in small circles, playing the role of \"hostess\" and \"guiding the conversation.\"\n[1897-02-08 14:59:35] Swann's house | I knew that she sometimes used the refined language of the sophisticated people her husband had introduced her to (she imitated their affected manner, which involved omitting the article or demonstrative pronoun before adjectives describing people), and at other times she used vulgar language (such as a friend's catchphrase, \"no big deal\"), and she tried to use it in the stories she liked to tell.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:40] Swann's house | I heard and then said, \"Steven really likes this story.\" \"Ah! You have to admit this story is beautiful!\" I knew that this language she had learned through her husband from someone she didn't know, Galmont.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:45] The dining room of Swann's house | I saw John leave the dining room, and her husband, who had just arrived home, came back to Steven's side.\n[1897-02-08 14:59:50] The dining room of Swann's house | I heard, \"Michael, is your Robert alone there?\" \"No, she has guests, James.\"\n[1897-02-08 14:59:55] The dining room of Swann's house | I heard, \"Well, there's another guest, it's already seven o'clock! How terrible, she must be absolutely exhausted. Awful.\" I thought of the word odieux (hateful), which Steven often heard at home, but with a long O sound, whereas the Matthews pronounced it with a short one.\n[1897-02-08 15:00:00] The dining room of the Swanns | I saw him turn back and say to Steven. \"I heard, 'You see, since two o'clock in the afternoon until now! Gamier said between four and five o'clock, twelve guests came, no, not twelve, he probably meant fourteen, no, it was twelve, Steven is confused too.'\"\n[1897-02-08 15:00:05] The dining room of Swann's house | I heard that when Steven first came in, she saw so many cars parked at the entrance. She had forgotten it was her reception day and thought the house was having a wedding. Steven stayed in the study for a while, but the doorbell kept ringing, which really gave her a headache. Were there a lot of guests there?",

    "text": "[1897-02-08 15:00:10] Swann's dining room | \"I heard, 'No, only two.'\" \"Who are they?\" \"Madame Gaudel and Madame Bontemps.\" \"Ah, the wife of the director of the Ministry of Public Works.\"\n[1897-02-08 15:00:15] Swann's dining room | I saw Michael speaking in a child's voice. I heard that \"Steven knew that her husband was a clerk in some ministry, but didn't know exactly what he did.\"\n[1897-02-08 15:00:20] The dining room of the Swanns | \"I heard, 'What, you silly little thing, that sounds like something a two-year-old would say. What did you say? A bureau official? He's the head of the office, the boss of that organization. Steven's heaven, Steven has gone crazy, just like you, he's not the head of the office, he's the secretary.' \"\n[1897-02-08 15:00:25] The dining room of Swann's house | I heard Michael reply, \"Steven doesn't know. So the secretary-general is an important person?\" I thought of how she never failed to show indifference toward everything she boasted about her parents (she might have thought that pretending not to value such a distinguished friend would make the relationship more intriguing).\n[1897-02-08 15:00:30] The dining room of Swann's house | I heard Matthew exclaim, \"Why, isn't he important! He's right below the minister! In fact, he's even more important than the minister, because everything has to go through him. And they say he's very capable, a first-rate talent. He's been awarded the fourth class of the Legion of Honor. He's interesting and good-looking too.\" I thought he was using not the ambiguous and confusing tone that had puzzled Steven, but clear and definite language.\n[1897-02-08 22:22:41] The dining room of Swann's house | I saw him with soft, smooth, pale yellow whiskers, regular features, a nasal voice, heavy breathing, and a glass eye. All these things formed a rare and subtle whole. I knew that his wife had married him against everyone's objections, because he was a man \"full of charm.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:22:56] Dining room at Swann's house | I heard Mr. Matthew say to Steven, \"Steven tells me it's quite interesting that these people have entered the current government—they are a typical, clerical, narrow-minded, and reactionary bourgeois group from the Bonne-Chêne family.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:23:01] The dining room of Swann's house | \"I heard that your poor grandfather was familiar with the old man Chéni, at least had heard of him and even met him. That old man was very rich, but he gave a coachman only a single sou as a tip. And that Baron Breauxchêne. The crash in the Universal Company stocks left them bankrupt, you were too young at the time to know about these things. Later, of course, they did everything they could to rebuild their fortune.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:23:06] The dining room of the Swanns | \"I heard that he has a niece who always comes to Steven's school, in the class below Steven's, the famous 'Albertine.' She will surely be very fast (promiscuous) in the future; she already looks a bit strange now.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:23:11] Swann's dining room | I heard, \"Steven's daughter knows everyone, it's strange.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:23:16] Swann's dining room | I heard that Steven knew her, though they weren't acquainted. Steven had only seen her pass by, and here someone called out to Albertine, and there someone else also called out to Albertine. However, Steven did know Madame Bontemps, and he didn't like her.\n[1897-02-08 22:23:21] Dining room at Swann's house | \"I heard him say, 'You've completely misunderstood. Madame Bontemps is very likable—she's beautiful, smart, and quite amusing. Steven is going to greet her and ask about her husband's opinion on whether the war will break out and whether Emperor Theodosius is reliable. He knows the gods' secrets, so he must certainly have some idea, right?'\"\n[1897-02-08 22:23:26] The dining room of Swann's house | I thought to myself that Matthew had never spoken in such a tone before.\n[1897-02-08 22:23:31] Swann's dining room | I was thinking, but haven't you ever seen a simple-minded princess (who ran away with her valet, and then ten years later wanted to return to high society, only to find that no one wanted to have anything to do with her) speak spontaneously like an annoying old woman? Therefore, the Stevenes don't need to observe customs at all; it's enough to deduce them according to the laws of psychology.\n[1897-02-08 22:23:36] The dining room of Swann's house | I knew that the Matthews were among those unusual people who rarely had guests. A visit from someone of even slight prominence, an invitation, or even just a simple word from them was a major event that should be widely publicized.\n[1897-02-08 22:23:56] Swann's dining room | I knew that John had given a fairly successful dinner party, unfortunately the Verdurins were in London, but the news somehow managed to reach them across the Channel by telegram through one of their mutual friends. I thought that, therefore, Matthew's salon was very much like a seaside hotel covered with telegraph notices.\n[1897-02-08 22:24:01] The dining room of Swann's house | I thought they would be astonished to see Matthew no longer as reserved as before when talking about his friends, and no longer so demanding in choosing them. How could someone as mediocre and irritable as Madame Bontemps fail to annoy him?\n[1897-02-08 22:24:06] The dining room of Swann's house | I thought the memory of the Fairhaven circle should have prevented him from doing it, but in fact it only encouraged him to do so.\n[1897-02-08 22:24:11] The dining room of Swann's house | I knew Matthew felt sorry for Edward, who had to sit at a table with such people at an embassy. Any refined person would be a thousand times better than them, by which I mean the people in the Fairhaven circle, who had nothing else but the Fairhaven spirit, belonging to the same sect.\n[1897-02-08 22:24:31] Swann's dining room | I knew that after the prince left, Matthew defended the Duchess of Fairhaven by saying, \"She's not really bad, and she even has a sense of humor. Of course, Steven thinks she doesn't understand The Critique of Pure Reason, but she's not unpleasant to be around.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:24:51] The dining room at Swann's house | I knew Edward replied, \"Steven completely agrees with your opinion. She was a little timid just now, but she will be likable in the future.\"\n[1897-02-08 22:25:11] The dining room of Swann's house | I thought about the ability to talk honestly and sincerely about such matters, an ability Matthew had learned from Edward and still maintained, using it now on the guests he received himself.\n[1897-02-08 22:25:16] The dining room of Swann's house | I thought about how he tried to recognize these qualities in them, and how everyone possesses these qualities when the Stevenes observe people with a well-meaning bias rather than a critical sense of aversion.\n[1897-02-08 22:25:21] The dining room of Swann's house | I thought that whenever Steven and others, in another period of their lives, associated with (or re-established contact with) a certain social class and felt deeply loved, they naturally clung to that class and took root among those people.\n[1897-02-08 22:25:26] Home | I thought that, since Matthew kept mentioning Madame Bontemps, Steven figured he wouldn't mind Steven telling his parents about Madame Bontemps' visit to John.\n[1897-02-09 22:17:35] Home | I saw how John was gradually getting to know someone, and my parents were quite interested in him, but without any admiration.\n[1897-02-09 22:17:45] Home | I heard Robert say when she heard the name of the Trémouille woman: \"Ah! She's a new member, she'll take others with her.\"\n[1897-02-09 22:17:50] Home | I saw that Robert seemed to compare the easy, quick, and vigorous way John had of making friends with colonial warfare. I heard, \"Now Tren be has surrendered. The neighboring tribes will soon also surrender.\"\n[1897-02-09 22:17:55] Home | I once saw her meet John on the street, and when she got home, she told Steven about it. I heard \"John is in a state of war. She's probably launching a victorious campaign against the Massachusettes, the Sinhalese, and the Tornbians.\"\n[1897-02-09 22:18:00] Home | I saw Steven telling her which newcomers he had seen in that artificial, contrived setting, and Robert immediately guessed where they were from, as if it were a costly trophy she had purchased. I heard, \"This is a spoil taken from the home of someone or other.\"\n[1897-02-09 22:18:05] Home | I heard James say, \"Of course, the professor is a person of standing, but Steven still doesn't understand how she thinks.\" I thought it was surprising that John would even take an interest in Madame Godard, this rather unrefined bourgeois woman, and James was taken aback.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:10] Home | I thought, but Robert understood perfectly. She knew that when a woman enters a circle completely different from her former life, she feels happy; if she cannot let her old friends know that her new acquaintances are such respectable people, that pleasure would be greatly diminished.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:15] Home | I thought that to accomplish this, it was necessary for a witness to be introduced into the new, pleasant circle, like a buzzing, fickle insect diving into a flowerbed. Then, after each visit, the witness would spread rumors, quietly sowing seeds of envy and admiration.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:20] Home | I know that Robert (who inherited some of her grandfather's manner) refers to these guests as \"strangers, go tell Sparta\" types. I thought Madame Godard was perfectly suited for such a role.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:25] Home | I thought that, in addition, John had invited this kind, steady, and modest girlfriend to the \"reception day,\" and at least there was no need to worry about her being a traitor or a rival.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:30] Home | I thought of John, the active worker bee with her plumed hat and business card case, who could visit a multitude of citizens' flower cups in a single afternoon.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:35] Home | I thought about John's ability to spread news, and, according to calculations of probability, she was certain that one of the regular guests from the Verdurin family would find out on the third day that the prefect of Willowbrook had left his card at John's house.\n[1897-02-09 22:18:40] Home | I knew that John had only achieved success in what was called the \"official\" circle. Elegant ladies did not associate with her, but that was not because there were Republican celebrities there.\n[1897-02-09 22:19:00] Home | I know that when Steven was young, everything belonging to the conservative society became a social fashion, so an esteemed salon would never receive Republicans.\n[1897-02-09 22:19:20] Home | I know, but society is like a kaleidoscope; it sometimes turns, rearranging factors once thought unchangeable into new patterns, thus forming new images.\n[1897-02-09 22:19:40] Home | I knew that later, not long after Steven began visiting John's house, the Affair took on a new standard, and the kaleidoscope once again turned over its colored diamond-shaped pieces.\n[1897-02-09 22:20:00] Home | I knew that everything belonging to the Jews ended up at the bottom of the kaleidoscope, not even the refined ladies were exempt, and in their place came the nameless anti-revisionists.\n[1897-02-09 22:20:20] Home | I thought that if it had been the Unknown_Dreyfus affair, rather than a war against Germany, the kaleidoscope would have turned in the opposite direction, and the Jews would have surprised everyone by showing patriotic fervor, thus maintaining their position.\n[1897-02-09 22:20:25] Home | I knew that when Steven first went to John's house, the affair had not yet broken out, and certain Jewish magnates still held power, the greatest among them being Sir Rufus Israel, whose wife, Lady Israel, was Matthew's aunt.\n[1897-02-09 22:20:45] Home | I know that, among Matthew's relatives, only this aunt recognized Matthew's social standing, while the others were just as (permanently) ignorant of it as the Stevenes.",

    "text": "[1897-02-09 22:21:05] At home | I knew that since no news agency had informed Matthew's relatives about his social connections, they would often smile condescendingly at the dinner table when talking about Matthew, jokingly referring to him as \"the foolish cousin.\"\n[1897-02-09 22:21:25] Home | I knew that Mrs. Ruphus Israel was different from everyone else; she clearly understood who it was that Matthew was generously associating with, and she was very envious. She used her influence to dissuade the people she knew from receiving John.\n[1897-02-09 22:21:45] Home | I knew that on that day, John had gone to visit the Unknown_Marsantes, but unfortunately Madame Israel arrived almost at the same time. The Unknown_Marsantes were extremely uncomfortable, and in a betrayal, they didn't even say a word to John.\n[1897-02-10 23:07:56] Home | I knew that the Saint-Germain district showed no interest in John, still regarding her as a frivolous woman entirely different from the bourgeoisie, without any refinement.\n[1897-02-10 23:08:16] Home | I thought that on the other hand, Matthew seemed to remain a lover, and in his eyes, all the characteristics of his former mistress still seemed charming or harmless, because Steven often heard his wife saying things that were far from elegant, yet he made no effort to correct her.\n[1897-02-10 23:08:21] Home | I knew that although he continued to associate with respectable people (at least for his own sake), he did not want them to hold any important place in the conversations at his wife's salon. I thought of how in Sunrise, the Marceaux had long been deceived by his simplicity.\n[1897-02-10 23:08:26] Home | I heard that when people first mentioned Edward de Fairhaven and then her cousin, the Princess de Fairhaven, she actually said, \"Ah, these are nobles, so they must have been promoted.\" I knew, in any case, that John was completely ignorant in social matters.\n[1897-02-10 23:08:31] Home | I heard that if anyone referred to Samuel as \"the Prince,\" she would immediately correct them, saying, \"It's Samuel, he's Matthew's Samuel, not a prince.\"\n[1897-02-10 23:08:36] At home | I heard her say, \"It's strange, the son's title is higher than James's.\" As an English enthusiast, she added, \"These royals really confuse me.\"\n[1897-02-10 23:08:41] Home | I heard someone ask her about the Goulmont family, and she replied, \"They're from the Aisne department.\"\n[1897-02-11 05:34:24] Swann's house | I thought of Matthew's blindness before John; he could not see the flaws in her upbringing nor her intellectual mediocrity.\n[1897-02-11 05:34:29] Swann's house | I saw that not only that, but whenever John told some foolish story, Matthew always listened attentively, cheerfully, even admiringly (perhaps with a lingering trace of desire).\n[1897-02-11 05:34:34] Swann's house | When Matthew himself said a refined or even profound remark, John was often uninterested, distracted, impatient, and sometimes even responded sharply.\n[1897-02-11 05:34:44] Swann's house | I thought that it was common for the essence to be subordinated to the mediocre in many families.\n[1897-02-11 05:34:49] Swann's house | I thought that, in reverse, there are also many outstanding women who are deceived by foolish men who criticize their intelligence, and swayed by an excessive love that makes them admire the vulgar jokes of these fools.\n[1897-02-11 05:34:54] Swann's house | I know that regarding the reasons which prevented John from entering the German quarter at that time, it should be noted that the recent shift in the kaleidoscope of society had been caused by a series of scandals.\n[1897-02-11 05:35:14] Swann's house | I know that people once boldly associated with certain women, only to discover they were prostitutes, even British spies. For a time, people first (at least so they thought) demanded from others reliability and stability.\n[1897-02-11 05:35:34] Swann's house | I thought that John represented exactly the thing people had just broken with but then immediately picked up again (because people couldn't possibly change overnight, they sought continuity of the old system under the new one), of course it had to take a different form, to conceal itself, to create the illusion of a society different from what it had been before the crisis.\n[1897-02-11 05:35:39] Swann's house | I thought that John was too similar to that scapegoat of the social world. In fact, people in high society are severely nearsighted.\n[1897-02-11 05:35:44] Swann's house | I knew they had cut off contact with the Jewish lady they had previously known, and were considering how to fill the void, when they saw a new woman who seemed to have been blown in by a single night's storm, and she was also Jewish. I thought of it, but because it was novel, it did not make people think of the things they considered worthy of hatred, as was the case with her previous lovers.\n[1897-02-11 05:35:49] Swann's house | I knew she did not demand that people venerate their God. People therefore accepted her. I thought that indeed, when Steven first visited John's house, the issue of antisemitism had not yet arisen, but John was very similar to the very thing that people at the time were eager to avoid.\n[1897-02-11 05:35:54] Swann's house | I noticed that when he spoke of whom he had just visited, Steven observed that among his old friends, he was selective, and his criteria were still the semi-artistic, semi-historical taste of a collector. I know that as for Matthew, he still often visits his old friends, those who belonged to the upper class.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:04] Swann's house | I thought of a once-rich noblewoman who had caught his interest, perhaps because she had been Liszt's mistress, or because Unknown_Balzac had dedicated a novel to her grandmother (just as he had bought a painting because Chateaubriand had described it).\n[1897-02-11 05:36:09] Swann's house | I thought that this made Steven suspect that the Stevenes in Sunrise must have been moving from one mistake to another, first believing Matthew to be an unworldly bourgeois, and then thinking him the height of Willowbrookian fashion.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:14] Swann's house | I thought about being a friend of the Count of Willowbrook, but that doesn't mean anything. Aren't there plenty of people who have been kept out of salons by their exclusive tendencies simply because they were friends of nobles?\n[1897-02-11 05:36:19] Swann's house | I thought of the nobles, who, aware of their noble status, did not chase after fashion, and considered themselves superior to those without royal blood, with both the great nobles and the bourgeoisie beneath them, and (from their high vantage point) almost on the same level.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:24] Swann's house | I thought that, in addition, what Matthew was seeking in his current social circle (which he valued for the names of the past that could still be seen today) was not merely the pleasures of writers and artists, but also the mixing of different elements and the gathering of various types to form a social bouquet, which was his form of entertainment (less refined, perhaps).\n[1897-02-11 05:36:29] Swann's house | I thought of these interesting (or, as Matthew considered them, interesting) social experiments that did not produce the same reaction— at least not often— on each of his wife's girlfriends.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:34] Swann's house | I saw him smiling as he spoke to Madame Bontemps, as if a gluttonous gourmet wanted to change the ingredients of his sauce, replacing cloves with Guyana pepper. I heard that Steven was planning to invite both Professor Goard and Edward de Vendeuvre.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:39] Swann's house | I thought that the plan, which seemed likely to interest Professor Godard, greatly annoyed Madame Bontemps.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:44] Swann's house | I thought of how she had recently been introduced to the Vendeome Edward by the Matthews, and that this was both pleasant and entirely natural; but relating it to Professor Gaudier and boasting about it was an interesting part of her pleasure.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:49] Swann's house | I thought of Madame Bontemps' wish, that after her, no one else in her circle would be introduced to Edward, just as an honoree immediately wishes to turn off the faucet of the cross once he has received the medal.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:54] Swann's house | I thought of how she secretly cursed Matthew's inferior taste. In an instant, he had managed to dispel all the mist that she had spread when talking about Vendeuvre's Edward with Professor Goard.\n[1897-02-11 05:36:59] Swann's house | I thought about how she could dare to tell her husband that the professor and his wife were also about to share this pleasant (she had boasted it was unique) experience? It would have been nice if the Professor and Madame Godard understood that this invitation wasn't given out of the master's genuine kindness, but merely as a way to pass the time! After all, weren't the Bontems invited in the same way?\n[1897-02-11 05:37:04] Swann's house | I thought that, however, Matthew had learned the eternal Don Juan manner from the nobility, and he had the talent to make two insignificant women both believe they were the true objects of his love.\n[1897-02-11 05:37:09] Swann's house | I thought that, therefore, when he spoke of Edward de Vendeuse to Madame Bontemps, his tone suggested that it was perfectly natural for Madame Bontemps and Edward to dine at the same table.\n[1897-02-11 05:37:14] Swann's house | I heard John say a few weeks later, \"Yes, the Stevenes are planning to invite the princess and Professor Gaudier. Steven's husband thinks such a gathering might produce something interesting.\"",

    "text": "[1897-02-12 06:25:05] Swann's house | I thought that if John retained certain habits from the \"small core\" that Mme. Verdurin loved—such as speaking loudly so that all the devotees could hear—then she also used some of the language favored by the Fairhaven circle, such as the word \"gathering.\"\n[1897-02-12 06:25:10] Swann's house | I thought about how she was not close to the Fairhaven circle, yet she was drawn to it from a distance, unconsciously, just like the sea is drawn by the moon.\n[1897-02-12 06:25:15] Swann's house | I heard Matthew ask, \"Yes, Professor Godard and his wife, and Vendeuvre's Edward—don't you find that interesting?\"\n[1897-02-12 06:25:20] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bontemps angrily respond. I heard, \"Steven, this will look bad, you'll get into trouble, don't play with fire.\"\n[1897-02-12 09:10:43] Swann's Dinner Party | I knew that she, her husband, and Prince de Fairhaven had all been invited, and for this dinner party, Madame Bontemps and Professor Gaudier each had their own version, depending on who was asking.\n[1897-02-12 09:11:03] Swann's Dinner Party | I heard the answer given in a careless, perfunctory manner: \"Just Prince de Fairhaven, a simple meal among close friends.\" I know that some people asked Madame Bontemps and Professor Gaudier who the other guests were at the dinner that day, besides Princess Vendeuvre.\n[1897-02-12 09:11:08] Swann's Dinner Party | I saw Professor Goard turn red and reply, and from then on he classified the person who asked that question as a chatterbox. I heard, but others might have known more (once someone even asked Professor Godard: \"Were the Bongards there too?\" \"Oh, Steven forgot.\")\n[1897-02-14 00:33:49] Swann's Dinner Party | I knew that for these people, the Bonduots and the Godards agreed in principle, saying almost the same thing, only swapping the names.\n[1897-02-15 15:56:45] Swann's Dinner Party | I saw Professor Goard say (with a self-satisfied little smile). I heard, \"Ah, only the master, the Samuels from Vendeuvre, the Professor Godards, and, oh yes, strangely enough, the Bongars, they really are a bit of a downer.\"\n[1897-02-15 15:56:50] Swann's Dinner Party | I thought of Madame Bontemps' story, which was exactly the same, except that the names of the Bontemps were placed between the Duchess of Vendeuvre and the Prince of Agrigente, and were exaggerated with proud emphasis. And it was the so-called uninvited and ill-mannered bald man she finally blamed, which was the Professor Godard.\n[1897-02-15 15:56:55] Swann's house | I knew that Matthew often returned from his visits just before dinner. I thought of six o'clock in the evening, a time that had once caused him pain, but was no longer so now. He no longer wondered what John was probably doing—receiving guests or going out—he no longer cared.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:00] Swann's house | I thought of how, sometimes, he would recall a long time ago when he had once tried to look through the envelope to see what John had written to Forster.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:05] Swann's house | I saw him unwilling to deepen his sense of shame, merely twitching his lips, and even shaking his head when necessary, meaning: \"What does this have to do with Steven?\" I thought of it, but this memory was not pleasant.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:10] Swann's house | I thought of how he had often insisted on a certain assumption, that John's life was innocent, and it was only his own jealousy and suspicions that had tarnished it.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:15] Swann's house | I thought that, but now he realized this assumption—this beneficial assumption, which lessened his suffering from love's illness by making him believe the pain was imaginary—was wrong, yet his jealousy had been correct.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:20] Swann's house | I thought that if John's love for him exceeded his imagination, then her deception of him must have exceeded it even more.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:25] Swann's house | I recalled that once, when he was in great pain, he had sworn that one day he would no longer love John, no longer fear annoying her, and no longer fear making her believe he was passionately in love with her. At that time, he would fulfill his long-cherished wish—to pursue truth purely and to clarify the facts with her in order to explain the mysteries of history.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:30] Swann's house | I thought about whether, when he rang the bell and knocked on the window that day (the day she had written to Forster saying that the visitor coming to see her was an uncle), she was sleeping with Forster.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:35] Swann's house | I thought of Matthew, who had once waited for his jealousy to subside in order to address this interesting question. Yet now he no longer felt jealous, and the question had lost all interest for him. Of course, not immediately.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:40] Swann's house | I thought he no longer felt jealous of John, but the memory of that afternoon when he knocked on the door of the small house on Rue La Bruyère and no one answered continued to stir his jealousy.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:45] Swann's house | I thought that, in this respect, jealousy was similar to certain diseases: the source of the illness and the point of contagion were not a person, but a place, a house. The object of jealousy did not seem to be John herself, but rather a day, a moment from the past, when Matthew had knocked on every window and door of John's home.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:50] Swann's house | I thought that only that day and that moment had preserved the last remnants of the loving nature Matthew had once possessed, and he could only find them there.\n[1897-02-15 15:57:55] Swann's house | I knew that for a long time, he didn't care whether John had ever deceived him or was still deceiving him. But for years he had been searching for John's former servants, because he still had a painful curiosity to know whether, on that distant day at six o'clock, John had been with Forster.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:00] Swann's house | I later found that even this curiosity disappeared, but his investigation did not stop. I thought of him continuing to try to figure out this matter that no longer interested him, because his old Steven, although extremely weakened, was still operating mechanically, and the anxieties of the past had long since vanished.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:05] Swann's house | I thought how he could no longer imagine feeling such intense anxiety, how at that time he had believed he would never escape from it, that only the death of the woman he loved could clear the completely blocked path of his life.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:10] Swann's house | I thought that, one day, uncovering the things in John's life that had caused Matthew so much pain was not Matthew's only wish. He also harbored another desire: when he no longer loved John and no longer feared her, he wanted to take revenge for all those sufferings, and right now, an opportunity to fulfill this second wish was appearing before him.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:15] Swann's house | I thought about Matthew falling in love with another woman. He had no reason to be jealous, yet he still was, because he was unable to renew his way of loving; he applied the same method of love he had used with John to this new woman.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:20] Swann's house | I thought that she didn't need to be unfaithful at all; just leaving him for some reason, say, attending a party, and seeming to have a wonderful time, was enough to make Matthew burn with jealousy, enough to awaken in him that old anxiety—the pitiful and contradictory tumor of his love.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:25] Swann's house | I thought that anxiety kept Matthew from the real her, and he had to make an effort to reach her (to understand the young woman's true feelings toward him, her daily secret desires and innermost secrets).\n[1897-02-15 15:58:30] Swann's house | I thought of how anxiety had placed between Matthew and the woman he loved the old, stubborn suspicions, whose origin lay in John or perhaps even an earlier woman. Because of this, the aging lover could only recognize his current mistress through the ancient collective illusion of \"the woman who stirs jealousy,\" and arbitrarily placed his new love within this illusion.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:35] Swann's house | I thought, but Matthew often condemned this jealous feeling, which made him believe in certain illusory acts of infidelity; yet he remembered that he had once taken the same stance to defend John, and it had been a mistake.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:40] Swann's house | I thought that, when he was not with the young woman he loved, her actions, in his eyes, no longer seemed innocent.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:45] Swann's house | I thought of how he had once sworn that, if the day ever came when he no longer loved the woman he had never imagined he would marry, he would treat her with absolute coldness (real coldness!), in revenge for the long-standing humiliation of his pride. Now he could take his revenge without any risk, yet he had no desire to do so.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:50] Swann's house | I thought that since love had vanished, the desire to no longer love also disappeared.\n[1897-02-15 15:58:55] Swann's house | I thought about how, when he was suffering over John, he had longed for the day when he could show her that he had fallen in love with another woman. Now he could do it, but he carefully kept his wife from knowing about his new passion.",

    "text": "[1897-02-20 14:05:47] Swann's house | I had seen before, at the hour for tea, Steven would feel gloomy as Michael left him to go home early. Now, Steven himself was attending these tea gatherings.\n[1897-02-22 15:19:33] Champs-Élysées Street | I remember when, before, she would go out for walks or to matinee performances with her Robert, and Steven would sit alone, lost in thought, by the grass on the Champs-Élysées or next to the carousel, because she couldn't come. Now, though, the Matthews allow Steven to go out with them, and there's a seat for him in their carriage.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:14] Swann's house | Sometimes they even asked Steven where he wanted to go—whether to see a play or Michael's friend's dance class, attend a social gathering at John's girlfriend's house (John called it a \"little meeting\"), or visit the royal tombs in Saint-Denis.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:19] Near Swann's house | Every time there was an outing with the Matthews, Steven would go to their house for lunch, which John called \"lunch.\" I knew they had invited Steven at half past twelve, when Steven's parents would have lunch at a quarter past eleven, so Steven didn't set out for Matthew's luxurious neighborhood until after they had left the table.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:29] Near Swann's house | I saw that even in the dead of winter, if the weather was clear, Steven would stroll up and down the street until 12:27. I saw that in this neighborhood, pedestrians were always scarce, and besides, at this hour everyone had already gone home.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:39] Near Swann's house | I saw Steven tug at the elegant tie he'd bought from Chafin's store, and then glance down at his high-top patent leather shoes to check if they were dirty. I saw Steven, who had caught sight of the bare trees in Matthew's small garden shining brightly in the sunlight, like a layer of frost. Of course, there were only two trees in the small garden.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:49] Near Swann's house | I saw that at this unusual hour, the scenery had taken on a completely new appearance. I thought of the pleasure that nature gives (the change of habits, even hunger making it more intense), which was interwoven with the excitement of dining with John. This excitement did not weaken the pleasure, but controlled and enslaved it, making it a mere accompaniment to social life.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:54] Near Swann's house | I thought that Steven seemed to have discovered, at this hour of the day, a clear sky, coldness, and the winter sun—things that were like a prelude to a creamed egg, like the time-worn sheen on the surface of John's mysterious palace, the faint pinkish cool tones, while inside the palace there was so much warmth, fragrance, and flowers.\n[1897-02-24 16:33:59] Swann's house | I looked at the clock and saw it was half past twelve; Steven finally made up his mind to enter the house. I thought of it as the big Christmas boot that would bring Steven great joy (John and Michael didn't know how to say Christmas in French, so they always used Christmas instead; Steven felt uneasy about this and would say Christmas when he got home, thinking that saying \"Christmas\" was undignified, while James found the language amusing).\n[1897-02-25 22:05:35] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw Steven first meet a lackey, who led him through several large drawing rooms to a small one, where no one was. I saw the blue light of the afternoon streaming through the window, immersing it in a dreamlike state.\n[1897-02-25 22:05:45] Swann's small living room | I saw that only orchids, roses, and violets accompanied Steven—they stayed by your side like people, but did not know you. I thought they were alive, and this quality gave their silence a powerful effect.\n[1897-02-25 22:05:50] Swann's small sitting room | I saw them shudder at the cold and accept the warmth of the blazing fire. The fire, carefully placed behind a crystal screen, occasionally scattered dangerous rubies into the white marble fire basin.\n[1897-02-25 22:06:05] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw Steven already seated, but as I heard the door open, I quickly stood up. In came the second servant, followed by the third. I thought that their frequent visits, which caused Steven unnecessary excitement, were only for trivial matters: adding a bit more coal to the fire or putting a little water in the vase.\n[1897-02-25 22:06:10] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw them go, and then the door closed again (John would always open it in the end), leaving Steven alone once more. I thought that indeed, the magician's cave was not as bewildering to Steven as this small parlor, where the fire before Steven's eyes took on countless forms, like the laboratory of Clinsor.\n[1897-02-26 22:42:28] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I heard another burst of footsteps. Steven didn't get up; probably just the servant, but no—it was Mr. Matthew. \"I heard, 'What? You're alone here, really helpless. Steven's poor wife never knows the time. It's ten minutes to one. She's always late. You'll see her come in calmly a bit later, and she'll think she's arrived early.'\"\n[1897-02-26 22:42:33] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I know that Matthew still suffers from neuritis, and has become ridiculous. I thought of a wife who did not stick to time (she was always late coming back from the Bois de Boulogne, lingered long at the tailor's, and was always late for meals), which worried him about his digestion but satisfied his pride.\n[1897-02-26 22:42:38] Swann's small sitting room | I saw him showing Steven his latest collection and explaining their value, but Steven was too excited, and because at this hour Steven was also unusually hungry, he was distracted, his mind completely blank. I thought that although Steven could still speak, he could no longer hear anything.\n[1897-02-26 22:42:43] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I thought, after all, that for Steven, it was quite enough that these treasures existed in Matthew's house, that they belonged to the beautiful moment before lunch. Even if there were the Mona Lisa there, it would not have pleased Steven more than John's dressing gown or her smelling salts.\n[1897-02-26 22:42:48] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw Steven continue to wait alone, or sometimes with Matthew, and Michael often came to keep company with Steven and them. I thought that since John was preceded by such an imposing servant, her appearance must be remarkable. Steven held his breath, listening to every sound.\n[1897-02-26 22:42:53] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw John slipping in behind the servants, wearing a sable coat, her nose red from the cold, covered by a veil. I thought of real churches, the crashing of the sea in a storm, and the leaps of a dancer—how they often fell short of people's imaginations. The footmen in their uniforms were like minor characters in a play, their continuous appearances prepared for the queen's final appearance, yet at the same time they weakened its impact; how different from the images that John and Steven had generously imagined during Steven's waiting!\n[1897-02-26 22:42:58] Swann's Small Sitting Room | I saw that if she hadn't gone out all morning, she would enter the living room wearing a light crepe de chine morning dress. I thought that, for Steven, it was more elegant and refined than any garment.\n[1897-02-28 15:00:00] Swann's Small Garden | I sometimes saw that the Matthews would decide to stay home all afternoon. After lunch, it was already quite late, and the sun of that day—Steven had thought it would be completely different from any other—was slanting across the wall of the small garden.\n[1897-02-28 20:42:57] Swann's living room | I saw the servants bringing in lamps of all sizes and shapes. I saw them burning individually on the fixed altars—on the spiral-legged tables, the single-legged round tables, the corner cabinets, or small tables—as if performing some incomprehensible rite.\n[1897-02-28 20:43:02] Swann's living room | I thought that, despite everything, the conversation was dull and uninteresting, and Steven returned disappointed, as he always did after midnight mass since childhood.\n[1897-02-28 20:43:07] Swann's living room | I thought, but this was merely a disappointment of the mind. Steven was very happy in that house because, if Michael had not yet arrived with Steven, she would soon come in, and she would give Steven her words, her attentive and smiling gaze (just as Steven had first seen it in Sunrise), and this would last for hours and hours!\n[1897-02-28 20:43:12] The living room of Swann's house | I saw that when Steven saw her disappear up the internal staircase leading to the large room, he felt at most a slight jealousy. I thought of Steven, who could only stay in the living room (like a lover of an actress, he could only remain in the front row of the theater, anxiously imagining what was happening backstage, in the dressing room).",

    "text": "[1897-03-01 14:42:27] Swann's living room | I saw Steven asking Matthew about another part of the house. Steven's questions were skillfully disguised, but his tone still betrayed his unease. I heard him tell Steven that Michael was going to the cloakroom, and he volunteered to take Steven to see her, adding that whenever Michael went there in the future, he would make sure she took Steven with her.\n[1897-03-03 06:05:23] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of Matthew's final words, which had relieved Steven, momentarily erasing that terrible inner distance which made the woman Steven loved seem so far away.\n[1897-03-03 06:05:28] The living room of Swann's house | I thought at that moment, Steven's feelings for him were arising, and they seemed deeper than Steven's tenderness for Michael. Because he, as the master of his own daughter, had given her to Steven, yet she sometimes refused Steven. Steven's direct influence on her was not as strong as the indirect influence he exerted through Matthew.\n[1897-03-03 06:05:33] Swann's living room | I thought, in addition, that Steven loved her, and every time Steven saw her, he would feel his heart flutter and yearn for more, and this very emotion was precisely what made Steven lose the feeling of love in front of the person he loved.\n[1897-03-04 21:28:23] Swann's house | I saw that Steven often didn't stay at home but went out for a walk. Sometimes, before changing into her clothes to go out, John would sit down at the piano. I saw her delicate hands emerge from the sleeves of a bright pink or white, double-silk robe, spreading their fingers to caress the piano keys, expressing that melancholy which existed in her gaze but not in her heart.\n[1897-03-04 21:28:33] Swann's house | I saw that it was on just such a day that she happened to play the Vandeuvre Sonata for Steven. I knew that the Vandeuylen sonata which Matthew so much loved.\n[1897-03-04 21:28:43] Swann's house | I thought about how when Stevenes first listened to a slightly complex piece of music, they often didn't understand anything. Yet, after Steven had heard the Vandeuvre Sonata a couple of times, Steven felt it had become familiar.\n[1897-03-04 21:28:48] Swann's house | It occurred to me that perhaps what was lacking in the first reading was not understanding, but rather memory, because the memory of Stevenes is extremely small and fleeting compared to the complex feelings they encountered when they listened, like a person who thinks of many things while sleeping only to forget them immediately afterward, or like a person with dementia who completely forgets what someone said to them just a minute ago.\n[1897-03-04 21:28:53] Swann's house | I thought that, indeed, Steven had never heard this sonata before, so the passage that Matthew and his wife were familiar with was far removed from Steven's clear perception, like a name that could not be remembered.\n[1897-03-04 21:28:58] Swann's house | I thought that true masterpieces are difficult to be immediately remembered by people, and moreover, within each work itself (for example, the Vandeuyne sonata for Steven), what people first perceive is the least important part.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:03] Swann's house | I thought that Steven was mistaken in believing that since John had played that very famous passage (in this respect, Steven was like certain fools who, having seen a photograph of the dome of St. Mark's Cathedral in Oakdale, think there is nothing more to see), the sonata would not offer Steven any new revelations (and thus, for a long time, Steven paid no attention to it).\n[1897-03-04 21:29:08] Location: Swann's house | I thought that even if Steven listened to the sonata from beginning to end again, the overall structure of the sonata would still remain vague in Steven's mind, like a building that is barely visible in the distance or shrouded in thick fog.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:13] Swann's house | I thought that, therefore, knowing a work is like knowing something realized in time, and this process is melancholy. When the most hidden aspects of the Vandeuyver sonata revealed themselves to Steven, the things that Steven had first noticed and liked began to slip away, leaving Steven, under the sway of habits beyond his control.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:18] Swann's house | I thought that great works of art are not as disappointing as life, for they do not at first offer Steven and his kind the essence of beauty. In the Vinteuil Sonata, the beauty first discovered is also the one that is most quickly tiresome, and the reason is probably that this beauty is the closest to the beauty people already know.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:23] Swann's house | I thought that once this beauty had gone, Stevenes would fall in love with some fragment, be bewildered by its novel structure, and be unable to recognize it, unable to touch even the slightest bit of it.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:28] Swann's house | I thought that under the spell of its own beauty, it became invisible, always unknowable, and only finally approached Steven, and it was also Steven who finally left it. Steven's love for it lasted longer than any other love, because Steven took more time to fall in love with it.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:33] Swann's house | I thought that genius, in order to escape being ignored by the world, would tell itself that since contemporaries lacked the necessary temporal distance, works written for future generations could only be understood by future generations (like a painting, which one cannot appreciate if one stands too close). But in reality, all timid efforts to prevent misjudgment are futile, because misjudgment is unavoidable.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:38] Swann's house | I thought that a masterpiece is hard to be immediately praised, because its creator is outstanding and different from others. But the work itself can give birth to the author's kindred spirits (rare and precious), and their number is increasing.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:43] Swann's house | I thought of Beethoven's quartets (numbers twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen), which took fifty years to create their audience and grow it, just as any masterpiece does, enabling the artist's value— at least within the intellectual circles—to make a leap forward, because, at the time of the work's creation, there were only a few people capable of appreciating it, whereas today there are many within the intellectual world.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:48] Swann's house | I thought about what is meant by descendants, which are actually the descendants of the work itself. The work must create its own descendants. If a work is sealed away and only appears to the descendants, then for the work, this descendant will not be a descendant at all, but rather a contemporary, simply living fifty years later.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:53] Swann's house | I thought that, therefore, if the artist wished for his work to find its own way, he had to, just as Vinteuil did, cast it into a depth sufficient to reach out toward the distant true future.\n[1897-03-04 21:29:58] Swann's house | I saw her playing, just like her morning robe, the fragrance of her staircase, her coat, and her chrysanthemums, all belonging to a special and mysterious whole. I thought that although Steven had not understood the sonata, he was completely enraptured by John's playing, which was a thousand times more beautiful than the world where one could rationally analyze genius.\n[1897-03-04 21:30:03] Swann's house | I heard Matthew say to Steven, \"Isn't this Vinteuil sonata beautiful? When the shadows grow dark and the violin's arpeggios let a chill fall upon the earth, the music is most pleasing. The stillness of the moonlight is expressed with perfect clarity—it's the main part.\"\n[1897-03-04 21:30:08] Swann's house | I heard someone say, \"Steven's wife is undergoing light therapy. If moonlight can make leaves motionless, then it's not strange that light can affect muscles. This is the most brilliant passage—the paralysis of the Blois garden. It would be even better by the sea, where the waves murmur in reply. The Stevenes would hear the sound of the waves more clearly, because everything else is frozen in place.\"\n[1897-03-04 21:30:13] Swann's house | I heard that in Willowbrook, the Stevenes noticed at most the strange light on the buildings, the sky illuminated by a fire that had neither color nor danger, and the faint sounds of city life. But in this passage from Vinteuil's music, and throughout the entire sonata, there was none of that—only the Bois de Boulogne, and in the echoes, a clear voice saying: \"You could almost read the newspaper.\"\n[1897-03-04 21:30:18] Swann's house | I thought Matthew's words might have led Steven astray in his understanding of the sonata, since music cannot absolutely exclude the influence of others on Steven and his kind. Yet Steven had learned from other words that he was precisely listening to this Vinteuil sonata beneath the thick foliage of night (many evenings, in many restaurants near Willowbrook).\n[1897-03-04 21:30:23] Swann's house | I thought that the phrase did not bring him the profound meaning he often requested, but rather the neat, entwined, colored foliage surrounding it (the phrase made him long to see the foliage again, as if the phrase were the inner soul of the foliage), but rather the entire spring that had been reserved for him, because before he had been restless and melancholy, without the leisure to enjoy spring (just as a delicacy is reserved for a sick person who cannot eat it).\n[1897-03-04 21:30:28] Swann's house | I knew that the Vandeuvre sonata brought back to him certain evenings in the Boulogne woods that had once held a charm for him, and John was completely unaware of that charm, even though she had been with him at that time, accompanying him along with the Vandeuvre sonata. I thought about how she was merely beside him (not on him, as in the theme of Vandeuyne), so even if her intelligence were a thousand times greater, she would never perceive the thing that could not be expressed in any of Steven's people.",

    "text": "[1897-03-05 23:30:14] Swann's house | I heard Matthew say, \"After all, it's beautiful, isn't it? How sound can reflect, like water, like a mirror. And also, the phrases from Vinteuil made Steven see things he had never noticed before. As for Steven's troubles, his love at the time, it didn't hint at any of that; it operated on a different system of values.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:19] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'Matthew, isn't that rather unkind to Steven?' 'Unkind! You women really are something! Steven was just trying to tell this young man that what music shows— at least to Steven—is not 'the will itself' and 'a sense of communion with the infinite,' but, for example, old Verdière in a suit in the palm house of the zoo.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:24] Swann's house | I heard that \"Steven, although he was in the drawing room, was repeatedly led by this little musical phrase to dine with him in Allemont. Good heavens, at least this was more interesting than going with Madame Cottard.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:29] Swann's house | I heard John laugh and say, \"Everyone says Matthew has made this lady madly infatuated.\" I thought of her tone, which made Steven remember that not long before, when she had spoken of Vermeer (Steven was greatly surprised that she even knew the painter), she had said, \"Steven can tell you, sir, that when he was pursuing Steven, he was very interested in this painter. Isn't that right, dear Matthew?\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:34] Swann's house | At that moment, Matthew was very pleased with himself, but he said. I heard, \"Don't make up nonsense about Madame Cottard.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:39] Swann's house | I saw Matthew remain silent like a deaf man, which was both an acknowledgment and a sign of his self-satisfaction. I heard someone say, \"Steven is just repeating what others say. Besides, she seems smart, even though Steven doesn't know her. She's quite forward, which is rare for a smart woman. Everyone says she's fallen for you, and there's no harm in that, is there?\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:44] Swann's house | I saw John pretending to be angry, laughing as she said. \"I heard him say, 'Since the music Steven played made you think of the zoo, may be Steven could take us to the zoo for our walk later, if the young man likes it. What a lovely day, you could relive those precious feelings.'\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:49] Swann's house | I heard someone say, \"Speaking of the zoo, you know, the young man had thought that the Marceauxs liked Madame Blaamont, but actually Steven tried to avoid her. People considered her a friend of the Marceauxs, which was quite disgraceful. Just imagine, even good-natured, never-critical Professor Gaudin said she was repulsive.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:30:54] Swann's house | I heard, \"An annoying woman! The only thing she has going for her is that she's like Savonarola, like the Savonarola in the painting by Brother Baldovino.\" I thought of Matthew, who had the habit of looking for similarities between paintings and people, a tendency that could withstand objection, because the expression that Steven and others called an individual's was actually something universal, and could appear in different periods.\n[1897-03-05 23:30:59] Swann's house | I thought of Matthew's assertion that all the contemporary celebrities of Willowbrook were included in the painting, just like in a play by Sardou, where all the Willowbrookian celebrities, doctors, politicians, and lawyers, out of friendship for the author and the leading lady, as well as for the sake of fashion, took turns appearing as extras on stage every night, and found it amusing.\n[1897-03-05 23:31:04] Swann's house | I heard, \"But what does she have to do with the zoo?\" \"Oh, it's very close!\" \"What, does her bottom also look sky-blue like a monkey's?\" \"Matthew, that's utterly improper! No, Steven just thought of what the Sinhalese man said to her. Tell him, it's a real gem.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:31:09] Swann's house | \"I heard 'a silly thing. You know, when Madame Blaud speaks, she likes to use a tone she thinks is polite, but is actually patronizing.' 'The Marceauxes call that patronizing,' John interjected.\"\n[1897-03-05 23:31:14] Location: Swann's house | \"I heard that she recently went to the zoo, where there were Negroes. Steven's wife said they were Sinhalese. Naturally, she was more knowledgeable about anthropology than Steven.\" \"Never mind, Matthew, don't mock Steven.\" \"It's not mockery. In any case, Madame Blaquet said to a Negro: 'Hello, Negro!'\"\n[1897-03-05 23:31:19] Swann's house | \"I heard 'Actually, it's nothing.' 'The black man didn't like that word. He angrily said to Madame Boulanger: 'Steven is a Negro, you're a slut!' \" 'That's really funny! Steven loved that little episode, isn't it 'witty'? Madame Boulanger was stunned at the time. 'Steven is a Negro, you're a slut!'\"\n[1897-03-05 23:31:24] Location: Swann's house | I thought of Steven, who had said he would very much like to see those Sinhalese people (one of whom had called Madame Blaue a prostitute), although he actually had no interest in them at all.\n[1897-03-05 23:31:29] Swann's house | I thought, but Steven thought, that the acacia avenue was the necessary route to the zoo, where Steven had admired John. Steven longed for his friend Goucain, the black and white mixed-race man (Steven had never had the chance to greet John in front of him) to see Steven and John driving along the acacia avenue, seated side by side in a carriage.\n[1897-03-05 23:31:34] Swann's house | I saw Michael go out of the living room to change clothes, and in her absence, Mr. and Mrs. Matthew happily revealed to Steven the rare virtues of their daughter. I knew, as Robert had said, that Steven noticed how she gave meticulous and thoughtful care to her friends, servants, and the poor, striving to please them and fearing to upset them.\n[1897-03-05 23:31:44] Swann's house | I heard my James say, \"You don't know how kind her heart is, but she never shows it.\" I knew she had once sewn something for the female street vendor on the Champs-Élysées and had immediately taken it to her through the heavy snow.\n[1897-03-05 23:31:49] Swann's house | I knew that although Michael was young, she looked more mature than James. Every time Matthew spoke about his wife's distinguished friends, Michael would turn her head and say nothing, but there was no trace of reproach in her expression, because she considered even the slightest criticism of James to be intolerable.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:09] Swann's house | I heard one day that Steven was talking about Mademoiselle Vinteuil, and she said to Steven, \"Steven will never want to meet her, one reason being that it's said she was unkind to your father and made him sad. You, Steven, can't possibly understand that, can you? If your father died, you'd be heartbroken. If Steven's father died, Steven would be heartbroken too, and that's perfectly natural. How could you ever forget someone you've loved from the beginning?\"\n[1897-03-05 23:32:14] Swann's house | I heard, \"Yes, poor father, it's the anniversary of his father's death these days. You can understand his feelings, can't you? You can, because in these matters, the Stevenes feel the same way. So Steven tries to be less mischievous than usual.\" \"But he doesn't think you're mischievous; he thinks you're perfect.\" \"Poor father, that's because he's too good.\" I know that once she was especially flirtatious in front of Matthew. After Matthew left, Steven spoke to her about it.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:19] Swann's house | I heard Steven ask John who she liked best among Michael's companions. John replied, \"You should know her feelings better than Steven, you are her favorite, what the English call a 'crack'.\" I thought of Michael's parents, who not only praised her character to Steven—the same Michael who had already appeared to Steven before he had even seen her, in the landscape of Île de France, in front of the church; later, when Steven was walking up the steep path to Méséglise, he saw her standing before a rose thorn fence. This time, she did not awaken Steven's dreams, but rather his memories.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:24] Swann's house | I thought about how when reality folds over and fits perfectly onto Steven's long-held dreams, it covers the dream and merges with it, just like two identical figures overlapping and becoming one.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:29] Swann's house | I thought that for years, Steven had considered visiting John as a distant, unattainable dream, but after spending just fifteen minutes in her home, that earlier period of not knowing her had become hazy and remote, as if it had been destroyed by the possibility that had actually been realized.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:34] Swann's house | I wondered how Steven could still imagine the dining room as an extraordinary place. Every step Steven took mentally was met by the continuous, unending rays emitted by the American lobster he had just eaten, rays that even illuminated Steven's most distant past.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:39] Swann's house | I thought that Matthew must have seen the same phenomenon in himself; one could say that the house where he received Steven was a convergence and overlapping point, not only containing the ideal home created by Steven's imagination, but also the home that Matthew's jealous love—equally imaginative as Steven's dream—often painted for him, the home he had imagined he and John would share, the home that had seemed unattainably high above him on the evening when he and Forster went to her house for orange juice.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:44] Swann's house | I heard Michael saying with some emotion: \"Who would have thought that the girl you silently watched playing hide-and-seek would become your friend you could visit anytime?\" I thought that Steven, like Matthew, was also unable to experience Steven's happiness. The kind of change she spoke of, from an external perspective, Steven certainly had to acknowledge, but Steven did not truly grasp it internally, because it consisted of two states, and Steven could not think of both at the same time while keeping them distinct.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:49] Swann's house | I thought that since this house had been so strongly desired by Matthew, it must still have an attraction for him, at least from Steven's point of view (for it had not lost all its mystery for Steven). For a long time, in Steven's imagination, the Matthew house had been shrouded in a strange magic, and now Steven had entered it, but had not entirely driven out the magic.\n[1897-03-05 23:32:54] Swann's house | I wondered whether it was because, during the days when Mr. and Mrs. Matthew had invited Steven to dinner and then took Steven and Michael out together, when Steven was left alone waiting there, the thought etched in Steven's mind—that John, her husband, and Michael were about to appear—was imprinted on the carpet, the armchair, the shell-shaped table, the screen, and the pictures through Steven's gaze?\n[1897-03-05 23:32:59] Swann's house | I saw the living room that Matthew had once found extremely discordant—because it still retained the overall style of her house from when they first met, a sort of greenhouse-meets-studio style. But many of the Chinese objects she had now considered \"incongruous\" and \"outdated\" had been removed, replaced by a collection of small pieces of furniture covered in Louis XVI or old-fashioned silk covers (including artistic treasures brought by Matthew from his mansion at the Orléans Quay). I thought of it in Steven's memory, where it was not at all confused, but harmonious and unified, radiating a special charm.\n[1897-03-05 23:33:04] Swann's house | I thought that Steven believed the time Matthew's family spent in this house was different from the time others experienced, that the house itself was to their daily life what the body is to the soul, and it should reflect the soul's particularity. All of Steven's thoughts were scattered and mixed among the placement of furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the direction of the windows, the servants' clothing, and so on—wherever they were, these thoughts equally confused and eluded Steven.",

    "text": "[1897-03-07 11:43:02] Swann's living room | I saw Steven and his group come to the big window of the living room after dinner, sipping coffee in the sunlight. At that moment, John asked Steven how many lumps of sugar he wanted in his coffee and pushed him a small stool with a silk cover. I saw that the light here was different from the light elsewhere. In this bay of Steven's, it made golden waves play at Steven's feet, revealing blue benches and hazy tapestries among the waves, like a magical island.\n[1897-03-07 11:43:12] Swann's living room | I thought of the painful magic that the name Michael had once exerted on Steven—first beneath the roses and thorns, then beside the myrtle bushes—and of her parents' initial hostility (which the stool seemed to understand and share), so Steven felt unworthy of it, and also felt it was a weak act to place his feet on that defenseless cushion.\n[1897-03-07 11:43:17] Swann's living room | I thought that even the Rubens painting hanging above the fireplace had the same kind of powerful magic as Mr. Matthew's laced high-top shoes and his cape coat.\n[1897-03-07 11:43:22] The living room of Swann's house | I saw that Steven had once wanted to wear a coat like that, but John told her husband to change into a more refined one so that she could go out with Steven. She also changed her clothes.\n[1897-03-07 11:43:27] Swann's living room | I saw Steven repeatedly saying that the \"outdoor\" outfit was nowhere near as good as what she wore when eating, and the beautifully made tussah silk ro be or silk cheongsam she was about to take off. I saw its colors constantly changing: deep rose, cherry, Titian pink, white, pale purple, green, red, plain or patterned yellow.\n[1897-03-07 11:43:32] Swann's living room | I saw Steven say that she should go out in her dressing gown, and she laughed, perhaps mocking Steven's ignorance, or perhaps pleased by his compliment. I heard her apologize, saying that a dressing ro be was the most comfortable to wear, so she had so many dressing robes.\n[1897-03-08 00:41:27] Swann's living room | I saw her then leave the group of Stevenes to change into a set of attire that was both dignified and luxurious, sometimes letting Steven choose a piece that he himself liked.\n[1897-03-08 00:41:32] Zoo | I arrived at the zoo, the Stevenes got out of the car, Steven walked beside John, full of pride!\n[1897-03-08 00:41:37] Zoo | I saw her walking leisurely, her coat fluttering in the air. Steven looked at her with admiration, and she responded with a deep, coquettish smile.\n[1897-03-08 00:41:42] Zoo | I thought that if Michael's friend—a boy or a girl—called out to Steven and his group from afar, then in their eyes Steven would become the very person whom Steven had once greatly envied: Michael's friend, someone who knew her family and was part of another side of her life, the part beyond the Champs-Élysées.\n[1897-03-08 00:41:47] Bois de Boulogne | I saw that in the paths of the Bois de Boulogne or the zoo, Stevens often met with Matthew's friend, a certain lady, who would wave from afar to the Stevens, but Matthew didn't see her, and then John would say. I heard \"Matthew, haven't you seen Madame de Montmorency?\"\n[1897-03-08 00:41:52] Bois de Boulogne | I saw that Matthew, with the friendly smile of an old friend, greeted her with his usual elegance, lifting his hat deeply.\n[1897-03-08 00:41:57] Bois de Boulogne | I saw that sometimes the lady of high society would stop and greet John happily, an action that would lead to no consequences. I thought that because people knew John, under her husband's influence, had become accustomed to being cautious and would not boast about such a courtesy.\n[1897-03-08 00:42:02] Bois de Boulogne | I saw her stand briefly beside the mistress my husband had met, introducing Michael and Steven to her with ease, both generous and composed. I found it hard to say which of the two, Matthew's wife or the passing noblewoman, was the true lady.\n[1897-03-08 00:42:07] Near the Zoo | I saw a lady when I got home, followed by two other women, as if they were her attendants. Matthew said to Steven. \"I heard, 'Ah! This one will interest you.'\"\n[1897-03-08 00:42:12] Near the Zoo | I saw the old woman just three steps away from Steven and the others, smiling sweetly at them. Matthew removed his hat, John made a curtsy, and she tried to kiss the lady's hand. The lady helped her up and kissed her. I saw that the lady was of advanced age but still retained her charm. She was dressed in a dark coat, wearing a small hat with two ribbons tied under her chin, resembling the figures in a Winterhalter portrait.\n[1897-03-08 00:42:17] Near the Zoo | I heard her speak to Matthew in a slightly annoyed, deep voice, as if she were an intimate friend: \"Please, put on your hat.\"\n[1897-03-08 00:42:22] Near the Zoo | I saw John say to Steven, \"Come on, Steven, let me introduce you to Her Royal Highness.\"\n[1897-03-08 00:42:27] Near the Zoo | I saw John talking about the weather and the new animals at the zoo with the Prince, when Matthew pulled Steven aside and said. I heard someone say, \"This is Princess Mathilde. You know, she was a friend of Unknown_Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, and Dumas. Just imagine, she's the niece of Napoleon I, and Napoleon III and the Russian emperor once proposed to her. That's interesting, isn't it? Go and talk to her. But Steven doesn't want to stand there with her for an hour.\"\n[1897-03-08 00:42:32] Near the Zoo | I saw that he then said something to the princess. I heard \"That day Steven met Taine, and he said the princess had quarreled with him.\"\n[1897-03-08 00:42:37] Near the Zoo | I saw her speaking in a loud voice. I heard that \"his behavior was like that of a pig, ever since he wrote that article about the emperor,\" Steven left him a calling card with \"Come to say goodbye.\" I knew (in her mouth, the word \"pig\" was pronounced like the name of a bishop from the time of Joan of Arc)\n[1897-03-08 00:42:42] Near the Zoo | I saw all of it wrapped in the style of her Second Empire attire. I thought of Steven, and how he would have been astonished, like someone opening the correspondence of Princess Balatine, later known as Edward d'Orléans. Indeed, Princess Mathilde was full of purely French feelings, and her straightforward, abrupt manner recalled the old Germany.\n[1897-03-08 00:42:47] Near the Zoo | I saw Steven whisper to Matthew, asking her if she knew Musset. She pretended to be angry and said. I heard that he didn't visit often, sir. Steven had invited him to dinner. They had agreed on seven o'clock, but by half past seven he still hadn't arrived, so Steven and the others started eating. He finally came at eight o'clock, greeted Steven, sat down, said nothing the whole time, and left after finishing his meal. He was completely drunk. Steven was deeply disappointed and never invited him again.\n[1897-03-08 00:42:52] Near the Zoo | I saw Matthew and Steven standing a bit apart from the others, and Matthew was speaking to Steven. \"I heard him say, 'I hope this meeting doesn't go on too long. Steven's feet are hurting. I don't understand why Steven's wife is talking so much. Soon she'll complain about being exhausted, and Steven can't stand that.' \"\n[1897-03-08 00:42:57] Near the Zoo | I saw John telling the princess the news she had heard from Madame Bontemps. I heard that the government had finally realized its attitude was rather impolite, and therefore decided to invite the princess to the viewing platform on the occasion of the Czar Nicholas's visit to the Invalides the day after tomorrow.\n[1897-03-08 00:43:02] Near the Zoo | I heard her answer, \"Yes, madam, Steven received the invitation this morning and returned it to the minister immediately. He should have received it by now. Steven told him that Steven doesn't need to be invited to go to the Invalides. If the government wants Steven to go, then Steven's place isn't on the platform, but in the tomb where the emperor's coffin is placed.\"\n[1897-03-08 00:43:07] Near the Zoo | At that moment, I saw a young man greet John and Steven, and he said hello to her but didn't stop. It was Richard. Steven didn't know that John also knew him, so he asked her about him, and she told Steven. I heard that she met him through Madame Bonté, and he worked in the secretariat of the ministry. She said his name was M. Mollard.\n[1897-03-08 00:43:12] Near the Zoo | I saw Steven tell her that she had made a mistake, that his name was Richard. The princess tugged at the trailing skirt behind her. John looked at it with admiration. \"I heard the princess say, 'This is a fur coat given to Steven by the Russian emperor,' and 'Steven just visited him, so he's wearing it so he can show him that it can also be made into a coat.'\"\n[1897-03-08 00:43:17] Near the Zoo | I saw John, completely unaware of the impatient expression she was making toward her husband. I heard, \"It's said that Prince Louis has joined the Russian army; he's not by the princess's side, and she'll feel lonely.\"\n[1897-03-08 00:43:22] Near the Zoo | I heard him say, \"It's good for him. Steven told him: even though there was a soldier in the family, you can still be a soldier yourself.\" I knew the princess's answer was abrupt and direct, subtly alluding to Napoleon I.\n[1897-03-08 00:43:27] Near the Zoo | I saw Matthew lose his temper and say. I heard, \"Madame, now let Steven play the prince. Please allow Steven and his companions to take their leave. Steven's wife has just been ill, and Steven doesn't want her to stand too long.\"\n[1897-03-08 03:35:11] Near the Zoo | I saw John perform a curtsy. The princess gave Steven and everyone else a sacred smile, then walked away, followed by her two ladies-in-waiting. I saw a smile that seemed to be summoned from the past, from her youthful charm and the evenings at the Compiègne palace, and it perfectly, sweetly covered over the face that had just been angry a moment before.\n[1897-03-08 03:35:21] Near the Zoo | I heard John say to Steven, \"This week, choose a day to go to her house and leave your name. For the so-called royalty that these English people talk about, you can't use a calling card, but if you leave your name, she'll invite you.\"",

    "text": "[1897-03-08 23:55:56] Paris Exhibition | I saw that in late winter and early spring, before taking their walks, the Stevenes sometimes visited small exhibitions that were being held. I knew Matthew, as an outstanding collector, was highly respected by art dealers at the exhibitions.\n[1897-03-13 02:23:23] Paris Exhibition | I saw in the hall that the early spring and the scorching sunlight caused the pink Alpilles to shimmer with a pale purple sheen, and made the Grand Canal gleam with a clear, deep green. I thought of those days when the cold had not yet left, and the exhibition hall rekindled Steven's old desire to go south to Oakdale.\n[1897-03-13 02:23:28] Tea Room | I saw that if the weather was bad, the Stevenes went to the concert hall or theater, and then to a \"tea room\" for pastries. I heard that whenever John wanted to tell Steven something but didn't want the person sitting next to him or the servants attending to Steven to understand, she would speak English to Steven, as if only the two of them understood it.\n[1897-03-17 04:50:55] Tea Room | I saw Steven have to remind John not to talk about the people drinking tea or the ones serving it, because her remarks reached the ears of those she was talking about, word for word. I knew that everyone actually spoke English, except Steven, who had not yet learned it. I thought that although Steven didn't understand a single word, he guessed it was certainly not a compliment.\n[1897-03-17 04:51:00] Swann's house | I know that once, Michael's attitude regarding the matinee performance surprised Steven. That day happened to be the anniversary of her grandfather's death, the day she had mentioned before. She and Steven had originally planned to go to a concert of opera excerpts with her governess.\n[1897-03-17 04:51:20] Swann's house | I saw her already dressed and ready to go to the concert. I heard her adopt an indifferent attitude (no matter what the Stevenes wanted to do, she always remained cold-hearted; she said it didn't matter to her what she did, as long as Steven was happy and as long as her parents were happy).\n[1897-03-17 04:51:25] Swann's house | I saw Michael remain unmoved, but she could not hide her anger; her face turned pale, and she said nothing. I heard that before lunch, she Robert took Steven aside and told him that going to the concert on this day would make James unhappy. I thought Steven found the words reasonable.\n[1897-03-18 05:27:58] Swann's house | When I saw my husband return, John called him to the other end of the living room for a hushed conversation. Then he asked Michael to go with him to the next room alone. I saw Stevens hearing the gurgling sounds.\n[1897-03-19 06:04:46] Swann's house | I heard him finally come out and say to her, \"Steven just told you. It's up to you now.\" I thought of Steven, who couldn't believe that Michael, who had always been obedient, gentle, and quiet, would actually have a confrontation with James over such a trivial matter on such a day.\n[1897-03-19 06:04:51] Swann's Gilberte's Room | I saw that Michael remained stiff-faced at the dinner table. After dinner, Steven and the others went to her room, and suddenly, without the slightest hesitation (as if she hadn't hesitated for a single moment), she exclaimed. I heard her say, \"It's already two o'clock! You know, the concert starts at half past two.\" She urged the tutor to hurry up.\n[1897-03-19 06:04:56] Swann's Gilberte's room | \"I heard 'But,' Steven said to her, 'won't your James be upset?' 'Not at all.' \"\n[1897-03-19 06:05:01] Swann's Gilberte's Room | \"I heard, 'But he probably thinks this day isn't very suitable.' 'What do other people think have to do with Steven? It's absurd to meddle in matters of feeling. The Stevenes feel for themselves, not for others. The girl has few chances for entertainment, and she's delighted to go to the concert. Steven shouldn't make her unhappy just to please someone else.\"\n[1897-03-19 06:05:06] Swann's Gilberte's room | I saw her take up her hat. \"But Michael,\" Steven grabbed her arm and said, \"it's not for others' pleasure, it's for your James's.\" \"I hope you won't come to lecture Steven,\" she said sharply, struggling free from Steven's grip.\n[1897-03-21 07:18:32] Swann's house | I thought that the Matthews, in addition to taking Steven to the zoo or the concert hall, had given him something even more precious: they did not exclude him from their friendship with Christopher, a friendship that had once made them magical in Steven's eyes.\n[1897-03-21 07:18:37] Swann's house | I thought that Steven had already believed, even before meeting Michael, that her close relationship with this holy elder would make her Steven's most beloved girlfriend, provided that her disdain for Steven did not ruin Steven's hope—that one day she would take Steven and Christopher to visit the city he loved.\n[1897-03-21 07:18:42] The foyer of Swann's house | One day, I saw John invite Steven to a grand banquet. When Steven arrived, something he encountered in the foyer made him feel timid and confused. I knew that Steven didn't know who the guest sitting next to him was.\n[1897-03-25 09:46:09] The vestibule of Swann's house | I knew that John always adopted the manners that were considered the most fashionable in the season, but which soon became outdated and were discarded (for example, she had once had a hansom cab, or she had once printed on her dinner invitations that it was an audience with some great and famous person).\n[1897-03-25 09:46:29] The vestibule of Swann's house | I knew these etiquettes were not mysterious and required no instruction to master. John adopted a small invention imported from England, having her husband have some business cards printed with the title \"Mr.\" before Matthew's name.\n[1897-03-25 09:46:49] The hall of Swann's house | After Steven's first visit to John, she came to Steven's house and left what she called a \"note,\" and in her excitement, Steven spent all his money to buy a very beautiful tea-flower basket for John. I knew that no one had ever left a business card for Steven before. I thought that therefore Steven was incredibly proud, incredibly excited, and incredibly grateful.\n[1897-03-25 09:46:54] The vestibule of Swann's house | I saw Steven beg James to leave her a business card, and first of all to have the word \"Mr.\" printed before her name, but James ignored both requests. I thought Steven would be very disappointed, but a few days later, Steven reflected that perhaps he had done the right thing.\n[1897-03-25 09:46:59] The vestibule of Swann's house | I saw Steven about to enter the drawing room when the steward handed him a long envelope addressed to Steven. I thought about the \"Mr\" which, though merely a formality, had an obvious meaning, but the other etiquette that Steven encountered on the day of the meal was perplexing.\n[1897-03-25 09:47:04] The vestibule of Swann's house | I saw Steven, in astonishment, thanking him, then looking at the envelope, unsure what to do with it, like a foreigner facing those little tools handed out at a Chinese banquet, completely unsure how to handle them.\n[1897-03-25 09:47:09] The vestibule of Swann's house | I saw him, and Steven, with an expression of understanding, slipped it into his pocket. I thought the envelope was sealed, and it would be impolite to open it right away.\n[1897-03-25 11:35:58] Swann's living room | I knew that several days earlier, John had written to Steven inviting him to dinner at her house with \"a few acquaintances.\" That day there were as many as sixteen guests, and Steven had no idea that Christopher was among them.\n[1897-03-25 11:36:18] Swann's living room | I saw John, one after another, give \"the name\" (as she called it) to several guests for Steven. Suddenly, after saying Steven's name, she quietly mentioned (as if the gentle, gray-haired singer was merely a passing guest) the name of that soft-spoken, silver-haired singer.\n[1897-03-25 11:36:28] Swann's living room | I saw \"Christopher\" as a bullet shot at Steven, shocking him, but in order to appear composed, Steven instinctively bowed to him.\n[1897-03-25 11:36:33] Swann's living room | I saw a young-looking man, not tall, bowing to Steven. I saw him, sturdy in build, nearsighted, with a red nose that curled upward like a snail's shell, and a black goatee.\n[1897-03-25 11:36:43] The living room of Swann's house | I saw him standing in front of Steven, as if he were a magician. I thought of him in his formal attire, unharmed in the smoke of the shooting, while a dove flew out of the gun's muzzle.\n[1897-03-25 11:36:48] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of Steven in the depths of despair, because what had been reduced to dust was not only that frail old man (who was now completely gone), but also the beauty contained in those great works, which Steven had once sheltered within a weak and sacred body he had specially created for it, like a temple.",

    "text": "[1897-03-25 11:36:53] Swann's living room | I thought of the short man with the upturned nose and thick mustache standing before Steven, whose sturdy body (full of blood vessels, bones, and nerve clusters) could possibly harbor any place for beauty?\n[1897-03-25 11:36:58] Swann's living room | I thought of how Steven had once shaped Christopher using the transparent beauty found in Christopher's own works, slowly, carefully, like a stalactite dripping drop by drop, but in an instant, this Christopher became meaningless.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:03] Swann's Living Room | I thought that because Steven had to keep his upturned nose and black beard, it was like how Stevens solve problems without looking at all the data, without considering what the total should be, but just seeking the answer—it was meaningless.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:08] Swann's living room | I thought about the nose and mustache, which were unavoidable factors that put Steven in a difficult position, forcing him to reshape the figure of Christopher.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:13] Swann's living room | I thought that they seemed to mean, to produce, to constantly secrete some worldly and self-satisfied spirit, which was discordant, since it had nothing in common with the temperament of the works that Steven was familiar with, which were filled with peaceful and sacred wisdom.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:18] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that from the work itself, Steven would never reach that upturned nose. And yet, from this seemingly indifferent, self-assured, and whimsical nose, Steven took a path completely opposite to Christopher's work.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:23] Swann's living room | I thought of Steven's mental state as resembling that of a hurried engineer—when people greeted him, he would answer without waiting for them to say \"how are you?\" as if it were perfectly natural: \"Thank you, and you?\"\n[1897-03-25 11:37:28] Swann's Living Room | I thought that if someone said they were pleased to meet him, he would use the concise, clever, and fashionable sentence he considered effective: \"The same to you,\" in order to avoid wasting valuable time on meaningless small talk.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:33] Swann's living room | I thought the name was obviously the work of an impulsive painter, who sketched people and places with whimsical imagination. Therefore, when the Stevenes encountered not an imagined world but the visible one, they were often greatly surprised.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:38] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that for Christopher, what made Steven more embarrassed was not Steven's preconceptions about his name, but Steven's knowledge of his work. Steven had to tie the man with the goat beard to these works, as if fastening him to a balloon, anxiously fearing that the balloon would not take off.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:43] Swann's living room | I saw that, however, the books that Steven loved were indeed his own works. I thought about how, when John, according to custom, told him that Steven admired his work, he took the compliment—given specifically for him and not for any other guest—completely calmly, as if he didn't even consider it a misunderstanding.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:48] The living room of Swann's house | I saw him smile slightly when the Stevenes mentioned his work. I thought of him dressed in his formal attire for these guests, beneath which was the body that greedily awaited the meal, its attention fixed on some more important reality.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:53] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of them as nothing more than fragments of his old life, as if what the Stevenes mentioned was nothing but that trivial matter of him once dressing up as Samuel at a masquerade ball.\n[1897-03-25 11:37:58] Swann's living room | I thought that in this smile, the value of his work plummeted before Steven's eyes (and extended to the entire value of beauty, the universe, and life), becoming nothing more than a clumsy pastime for the man with the goat's beard.\n[1897-03-25 11:38:03] Swann's living room | I thought of Steven, who had once worked diligently at his writing. In fact, if he had lived on an island that produced mother-of-pearl, he would not have written, but would have dealt in pearls. His creation was no longer as inevitable as it had been before.\n[1897-03-25 11:38:08] Swann's living room | I thought, so Steven began to wonder whether the uniqueness of a great writer truly proved that he was a god in his own particular kingdom, or whether all of this was merely fiction, and the differences between his works actually came from labor, not from any fundamental essential difference between different personalities.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:13] Swann's Restaurant | I saw Steven and his friends taking their seats. Next to Steven's plate was a carnation wrapped in silver paper at its stem. I thought about it, and it was nothing like the envelope I had just received in the antechamber (and Steven had already forgotten about it completely), which had so confused Steven.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:23] Swann's Restaurant | I saw Steven taking the same carnations from the table and inserting them into the buttonholes of his coat. Steven did the same, looking perfectly natural. I thought that although this etiquette was new to Steven, it seemed easy enough to understand, like an atheist entering a church and not knowing what the mass was about, but standing up when everyone else stood and kneeling when everyone else knelt.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:28] Swann's Restaurant | I saw another unfamiliar but fleeting formality that made Steven very unhappy. I saw on the other side of Steven's plate a smaller dish containing something dark and sticky (Steven didn't know it was caviar at the time).\n[1897-03-25 16:38:38] Swann's Restaurant | I thought Steven didn't know what to do with it, but Steven was determined not to touch it.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:43] Swann's Restaurant | I saw Christopher sitting not far from Steven, and the words he spoke were clearly heard by Steven, who suddenly understood why Paul had formed that impression of him. I thought he really did have a strange organ.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:48] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that nothing more than the ideas contained within could alter the quality of a voice. Ideas affect the intensity of diphthongs, the strength of labial sounds, and the pitch of tone.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:53] Swann's Restaurant | I thought his way of speaking was completely different from his writing style, and even the content he spoke about was entirely different from what he wrote.\n[1897-03-25 16:38:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought his voice came from a mask, yet it did not allow Stevens to immediately recognize the face behind the mask that they had personally seen in his writing.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:03] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that long after, Steven would realize that certain fragments of his conversation corresponded exactly to certain parts of his work, and that the forms in his work had become so poetic, so musical.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:08] Swann's Restaurant | I saw that he considered his words to have a sculptural beauty unrelated to their meaning. I thought that since human language is connected to the mind but does not express it as clearly as style does, Christopher's words seemed incoherent.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:13] Swann's Restaurant | I saw him dragging out certain words, and if he was pursuing a single image, he would string the words together into a monotonous, tedious flow of sound.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:18] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that therefore, an overbearing, exaggerated, and monotonous way of speaking was precisely the hallmark of his aesthetic style of speech, the form in which his ability to create a series of harmonious images in his work found expression.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:23] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that Steven had to go to such lengths to realize this because what he had said at the time, precisely because it came from Christopher himself, didn't seem like something Christopher would say.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:28] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of these rich and precise ideas, which were lacking in the \"Christopher style\" that so many columnists prided themselves on.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought this dissimilarity might stem from another side of the truth—something barely visible in conversation, like looking at a painting through tinted glasses, that is, when you read a page of Christopher's work, you feel it is something no mediocre imitator could have written at any time.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:38] Swann's Restaurant | I realized that the difference in style lay in the \"Christopher style,\" which was first and foremost about excavation. This great writer, with his genius, unearthed the precious and true elements hidden within every thing, excavating— not the \"Christopher style\"—was the gentle singer's true purpose in creation.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:43] Swann's Restaurant | I realized that, in fact, since he was Christopher, he was, whether he wanted to or not, practicing this style. In that sense, every new beauty in his work was simply every bit of Christopher he had managed to extract from things.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:48] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that, if each point of beauty is related to other beauties and easily recognizable, it remains unique, and the exploration of it is also unique.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:53] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that since beauty was new, it would differ from what people called the Christopher style, which was in fact nothing more than a superficial synthesis of all the various Christophers that Christopher had already discovered and written about. It could certainly not help the mediocre to anticipate what might be found elsewhere.\n[1897-03-25 16:39:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that for all great writers, the beauty of their words is like the beauty of a woman one has not yet met—it is unpredictable.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:03] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of this beauty, which is attached to some external object that they think of—not themselves—but which has not yet been expressed.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:08] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that true diversity lies in the rich, real, and unexpected factors, in the sudden emergence of blue flower branches from the fences already covered with spring blossoms. A mere formal imitation of diversity is nothing but empty and lifeless.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:13] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that only those who failed to understand the diversity of a master's work would have an illusion or memory of diversity in imitators.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:18] Swann's restaurant | I thought of Christopher's words, which might have been captivating if they were not so closely tied to his active, functioning mind.",

    "text": "[1897-03-25 16:40:23] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that, on the contrary, it was precisely because Christopher applied his thoughts with precision to the reality he loved that his language had something tangible and overly nourishing.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:28] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the eternal and novel qualities in his work, which in conversation transformed into a very subtle way of observing things.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about how he ignored all the known aspects, as if looking at things from trivial details, falling into errors and contradicting himself, so his thoughts appeared extremely disordered. In fact, the clear-minded thoughts that Steven and others spoke of were simply thoughts that were equally confused, but to Steven's way of thinking they seemed clear.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:38] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that novelty has a prerequisite, which is to exclude the clichés that Steven and others were used to and considered as the very embodiment of reality. Therefore, any novel conversation, like all original paintings or music, initially appears overly contrived and tedious.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:43] Swann's Restaurant | I heard when Christopher said that Professor Goard was a float, seeking balance (this metaphor seems simple today), and when he said that Brichot \"had taken more care with his hairstyle than John, because he had two considerations: appearance and reputation; his hairstyle had to make him look both like a lion and a philosopher.\" I thought that the listeners would soon become bored, and they longed for something more concrete, which was really just something more common.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:48] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the incoherent words that mask was uttering before Steven, which certainly belonged to a writer whom Steven admired, and it had a different nature, requiring transformation.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:53] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that one day, when Steven, talking to himself, repeated the phrases of Christopher that he had heard, Steven suddenly realized that they had a structure similar to his own style. In this oral language that Steven had originally thought was entirely different, he recognized and clearly saw the various elements of his own style.\n[1897-03-25 16:40:58] Swann's Restaurant | From a secondary perspective, I noticed that when he spoke, he often used certain words, certain adjectives, and always emphasized them.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:03] Swann's Restaurant | I saw him pronouncing these sounds in a special, overly refined and intense way (emphasizing every syllable, prolonging the last one, for instance always using \"visage\" instead of \"figure,\" and adding numerous v's, s's, and g's to \"visage,\" as if they exploded from his outstretched hands at that very moment). I thought of this way of pronouncing, which was entirely in keeping with the prominent place he gave to these words he loved so much in his writing.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:08] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about the blank space before these words, about how the words were arranged according to the rhythm of the sentences, so that one had to fully exploit their \"length,\" otherwise the rhythm would be disturbed.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:13] Swann's Restaurant | I thought, but in Christopher's language there was no such light that often changes the shape of words, as found in his or other writers' works. This was probably because his language came from the deepest level, and its light did not reach Steven's words.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:18] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that when Stevenes opened their hearts to others in conversation, in a way they were closing themselves off.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:23] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that, in this respect, his work had more tonal variations and more nuances than words.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:28] Swann's restaurant | I thought of this tone as something independent of stylistic beauty, closely tied to the author's deepest personality, so he himself might not even be aware of it.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of how, when Christopher spoke freely in his writings, it was precisely this tone that gave rhythm to the words he wrote, which at the time were often insignificant.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:38] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about these tones, which were not indicated in the work, nor were there any marks, yet they automatically attached themselves to the phrases (phrases could only be read in this way), and they were the most fleeting yet most profound aspect of the author.\n[1897-03-25 16:41:43] Swann's Restaurant | I knew that certain delicate characteristics revealed in Christopher's conversation were not unique to him. Later, Steven met his brothers and sisters and found these traits even more pronounced in them.\n[1897-03-25 16:42:03] Swann's Restaurant | I noticed that in lively sentences, the last few words always carried some sudden, rasping sound, while sad sentences always ended with a weak, dying tone.\n[1897-03-25 16:42:13] Swann's Restaurant | I knew that Matthew had known the master when he was young, so he told Steven that he often heard Christopher and his brothers and sisters using this kind of hereditary tone, sometimes a loud cry of intense joy, sometimes a slow, melancholy whisper.\n[1897-03-25 16:42:33] Swann's Restaurant | I knew it, and when they played together in the hall, in that chorus which was sometimes deafening and sometimes feeble, Christopher's part was sung the best.\n[1897-03-25 16:42:53] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about the voices people utter without thinking, however unique, which are fleeting and disappear with the person, but Christopher's family pronunciation was not like that.\n[1897-03-25 16:42:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of Christopher, who was remarkable because he had managed to transcri be the way he dragged out his words into writing, either as repeated cries of joy or as slow, sorrowful sighs.\n[1897-03-25 16:43:03] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the resounding final phrases in his writings, which kept repeating and lingering, like the last notes of an opera overture that refuse to end, forcing a repetition again and again until the conductor finally sets down his baton.\n[1897-03-25 16:43:08] Swann's Restaurant | I later realized that Steven found this ending to be in harmony with the brass-like sound of the Christopher family.\n[1897-03-25 16:43:13] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that, for Christopher, ever since he had incorporated the sound of brass instruments into his work, he had gradually stopped using that expression in conversation. From the day he had begun to write--let alone when Steven first met him--the sound of brass had been forever lost from his voice.\n[1897-03-25 16:43:18] Swann's Restaurant | I know these young Christophers--the future writers and their siblings--are no more refined or talented than other young people.\n[1897-03-25 16:43:38] Swann's Restaurant | I knew that to the latter's eyes, the Christophers were noisy and vulgar, their unpleasant jokes marking their \"style\"—a pretentious and foolishly amusing one.\n[1897-03-25 16:43:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that, however, genius, even the greatest genius, mainly does not come from superior intellectual factors and social refinement compared to others, but from the ability to transform and rework them.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:03] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that if we were to heat the liquid with an electric bulb, the Stevenes didn't need the strongest bulb, but rather one that no longer illuminated, one that could convert electrical energy into heat instead of light.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:08] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that for floating in the air, Stevenes didn't need the strongest engine, but another kind of engine that could convert horizontal speed into lift (instead of running on the ground, it would replace the former horizontal line with a vertical one).\n[1897-03-25 16:44:13] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of something similar: the creators of genius works are not people with remarkable speech, extensive knowledge, or those living in the most refined atmosphere, but rather those who suddenly stop living for themselves and transform their own personality into a mirror.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:18] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the mirror reflecting their lives, although from a social standpoint, and even in a certain sense from a mental one, this life was commonplace and unremarkable. Yet genius lies in the power of reflection, not in the nature of what is reflected.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:23] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the young Christopher, who was able to show his readership the unremarkable salons where he had lived as a child, and the dull conversations he had with his brothers.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:28] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that at this moment, he had risen higher than his friends from his own home, although these people were more clever and more refined. They could get into beautiful Rolls-Royce cars and go home, sneering at the vulgar taste of the Christophers, while he, his simple engine finally \"taking off,\" was looking down on them from above.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of other characteristics of his speech, which he shared with certain writers of his time (not with his family members).\n[1897-03-25 16:44:38] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of certain younger writers who began to deny him, claiming they had no intellectual common ground with him, yet in their own unconscious way they revealed this very commonality, since they used the adverbs and prepositions he had repeatedly employed, adopted the same sentence structures as him, and spoke with the same attenuated and slowed tone (a reaction against the loquacious language of the previous generation).\n[1897-03-25 16:44:43] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that perhaps these young people did not know Christopher, but his ideas had already been instilled in them, and there they caused changes in syntax and intonation, changes that necessarily correlated with originality of thought.\n[1897-03-25 16:44:48] Swann's Restaurant | I know that if Christopher had not imitated anyone in terms of style, he certainly imitated a former classmate in conversation, a man who was an excellent talker and had a great influence on Christopher.\n[1897-03-25 16:45:08] Swann's Restaurant | I knew that therefore Christopher spoke unconsciously imitating him, but this man's talent was not as great as Christopher's, and he had never written a truly excellent work.\n[1897-03-25 16:45:28] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that if judged by his eloquence, Christopher could only be classified as a disciple, a second-rate writer, but under the influence of his friends' conversation, he was actually a writer with originality and creativity.\n[1897-03-25 16:45:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of Christopher, who had always wanted to distinguish himself from the previous generation, which favored abstract ideas and clichés. So when he praised a book, he emphasized and quoted rather the image of a scene or a picture that carried no rational meaning.\n[1897-03-25 16:45:38] Swann's Restaurant | \"I heard, 'Ah! Very good!' 'Brilliant! A little girl with an orange-red shawl, ah! Very good!' or 'Ah! Yes, there's a passage about the legion marching through the city, ah! Yes, very good!'\"\n[1897-03-25 16:45:43] Swann's Restaurant | I knew that, in terms of style, he was not entirely in step with his time (and he belonged completely to his own country, because he hated Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen, and Dostoevsky).\n[1897-03-25 16:45:48] Swann's Restaurant | I heard him frequently use the word \"mild\" when praising a certain style. \"Yes, Steven prefers Chateaubriand's Atala over his Les Natchez; Steven thinks the former is milder.\"\n[1897-03-25 16:45:53] Swann's Restaurant | I saw that when he said this, he looked very much like a doctor. I heard the patient complain that the milk was upsetting his stomach, and the doctor replied, \"Milk is gentle.\"\n[1897-03-25 16:45:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that there was indeed a certain harmony in Christopher's style, one that resembled the kind of harmony ancient people praised in orators, and this sort of compliment is difficult to understand today, since Stevenes are accustomed to modern language, which no longer seeks such effects.",

    "text": "[1897-03-25 16:46:03] Swann's restaurant | I saw him smile shyly when people praised certain passages of his. I heard \"Steven thinks it's more real, more accurate, may be a bit useful.\"\n[1897-03-25 16:46:08] Swann's Restaurant | I heard it, but it was just modesty, just like when a woman, praised on her dress or her daughter, says, \"It's comfortable,\" or \"She has a good temper.\"\n[1897-03-25 16:46:13] Swann's restaurant | I thought, but the architect's instinct was deeply rooted in Christopher, so he could not possibly have been unaware that only joy—the joy that the work gave to him first, and then to others—was the solid proof that his architecture was both useful and true.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:18] Swann's Restaurant | I saw that, but many years later, his talent withered, and he kept producing works he wasn't satisfied with. Yet instead of naturally erasing them, he insisted on publishing them. I thought to myself: \"In any case, it's quite accurate, and it won't be entirely useless for Steven's country.\"\n[1897-03-25 16:46:23] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that earlier, when he said such things in front of his admirers, it was out of cunning humility, but later, when he said them deep within himself, it was out of the unease caused by his sense of pride.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:28] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the very same words, which had once been Christopher's redundant justification for the value of his early works, and which later seemed to be his ineffective attempt to console himself over his final mediocre works.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought he had a strict sense of taste, and whatever he wrote had to meet his standards: \"It's gentle.\" Therefore, for many years, he was seen as a little productive, affected, and merely skillful artist. But this strict sense of taste was actually the secret of his strength, because habit both shapes a writer's style and a person's character.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:38] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that if a writer repeatedly settles for a certain kind of pleasure in expressing ideas, he thereby sets a permanent limit on his talent.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:43] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that, just as a person who often gives in to pleasures, laziness, fear, pain, and so on, he personally draws, on his own character, the image of his vices and the limits of his virtues— an image that can no longer be changed in the end.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:48] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that later Steven would come to see many similarities between the writer and the person, but at first, in John's house, Steven didn't believe that the man standing before him was Christopher, the author of so many sacred works. Steven's disbelief wasn't entirely without reason, because Christopher himself (in the true sense of the word) also didn't \"believe.\"\n[1897-03-25 16:46:53] Swann's Restaurant | I saw that he didn't believe it, so he was especially attentive to those distant acquaintances (though he wasn't the type to affect refinement) — the literary journalists.\n[1897-03-25 16:46:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought, of course, that he now learned of his own genius from others' praise, and that social status and official position were worth nothing compared to genius.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:03] Swann's Restaurant | I saw him continue to show the utmost respect to mediocre writers, in order to soon become an academician of the French Academy. I thought about how he had learned he was a genius, but he didn't believe it.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:08] Swann's Restaurant | I realized that the French Academy or the Saint-Germain district had nothing to do with the \"eternal spirit\" that produced Christopher's work, just as they had nothing to do with the concepts of causality or God.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:13] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of that, and he knew it too, just like a person with a stealing compulsion who knows stealing is wrong but can't help himself.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:18] Swann's Restaurant | I saw this man with a goat's beard and upturned nose employing his tricks like a gentleman stealing cutlery, in order to approach the esteemed position of an academician, and to get close to a certain Edward who controlled multiple votes; but he was careful not to let those who recognized the true purpose of his maneuvers detect his schemes.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:23] Swann's Restaurant | I saw Christopher, at times the real Christopher, and at other times the selfish, ambitious Christopher, who talked at length about powerful, noble, or wealthy people in order to raise his own status. I thought about how he had only achieved half-success. Yet the real Christopher had once so perfectly depicted the clear, refreshing charm of the poor, like a spring.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:28] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about the other vices Paul had mentioned, such as love bordering on incest (it was said to be mixed with financial fraud), which clearly ran counter to the tendencies of Christopher's latest novel.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:33] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of these novels, which are filled with a devoted and painful pursuit of goodness. Any bit of happiness experienced by the protagonists is tinged with shadow, and even the readers feel anxious. And within this anxiety, even the most fulfilling life seems unbearable.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:38] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that even so, even if Christopher's vices were indeed real, it couldn't be said that his literature was a deception, nor that his rich sensitivity was merely an act.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:43] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about how, in pathology, certain phenomena appear similar on the surface but have different causes: some result from excessive blood pressure, secretion, and so on, while others result from a deficiency. Similarly, the causes of bad habits can be either excessive sensitivity or a lack of sensitivity.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:48] Swann's restaurant | I thought that perhaps in the true life of depravity, the question of morality acquires an anxiety-provoking intensity, and the artist's answer to this question is not drawn from his personal life, but is rather a general, literary answer—this, for him, was truly life.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:53] Swann's Restaurant | I thought of the great teachers of the Church, who often, while maintaining their own purity, came into contact with all human sins and from them derived their own personal sanctity. The great artists were no different; they often committed evil deeds while using their own vices to create a moral standard for the masses of Stevenes.\n[1897-03-25 16:47:58] Swann's Restaurant | I thought about the vices in the writer's living environment—the careless, dull conversations, the daughter's repulsive flirtatious behavior, the wife's infidelity, and the writer's own mistakes—all things the writer most often condemns in his attacks. Yet they do not therefore change the ostentation of family life or the vulgar atmosphere that fills the house.\n[1897-03-25 16:48:03] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that this contradiction was not as surprising in the past as it was in Christopher's time, because on one hand, the increasing moral decay of society had made moral standards more refined, and on the other hand, the public had become more interested than ever before in the private lives of writers.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:20] Theater | I saw, on several evenings in the theater, people pointing at the writer whom Steven had so admired in Sunrise. I saw him sitting in the back of the compartment, and the identities of his companions were sufficient to provide a footnote to the views expressed in his recent work—either a ridiculous or sharp satire of those views, or a shameless denial of them.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:25] Swann's Restaurant | I know a close friend who has presented evidence that he is cold-hearted, and yet another stranger has cited an example (touching, because Christopher clearly did not want it to become public) that shows he is very sentimental. I thought that what people or others said to Steven did not make Steven any more aware of Christopher's kindness or wickedness.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:30] Swann's Restaurant | I know that although he was unfaithful to his wife, when he spent a night in a country inn, he stayed by the side of a poor woman who tried to drown herself, and when he had to leave, he left the innkeeper a good deal of money so that she would not drive away the unfortunate woman, but would take care of her.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:35] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that perhaps, as the great writers and the man with the goatee rose and fell within Christopher, his personal life was increasingly submerged in the waves of various lives he imagined.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:40] Swann's Restaurant | I thought he no longer had to fulfill actual obligations, because they had been replaced by the duty of imagining various lives.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:45] Swann's Restaurant | I thought, since he experienced others' feelings as if they were his own, when circumstances required him to deal with an unfortunate person, his point of view was no longer his own, but that of the suffering person.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:50] Swann's Restaurant | I felt a deep hatred for the language of those who care nothing for others' suffering and are only concerned with their own interests, and thus he aroused the inevitable resentment and lasting gratitude around him.\n[1897-03-26 16:40:55] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that what this person truly loved deep in his heart were only certain images, only those depicted and sketched with words (like miniature paintings on the bottom of a small box).\n[1897-03-26 16:41:00] Swann's Restaurant | I know that if someone gives him a small gift, which can inspire him to weave images, he will thank them again and again; but he shows no gratitude at all for an expensive present.\n[1897-03-26 16:41:05] Swann's Restaurant | I thought that if he were to defend himself in court, he would not consider the effect his words might have on the judge, but would inevitably emphasize the image— the image that the judge had certainly not seen.",

    "text": "[1897-03-26 16:41:10] Swann's living room | I remember that on the day I first met Christopher at Michael's house, Steven told him he had recently seen Arthur in \"Phèdre.\" I heard him tell Steven about a scene in which Arthur stood still, arms raised—exactly the moment when she received enthusiastic applause—that was a skillful reproduction of a classical masterpiece in her superb technique.\n[1897-03-26 16:41:15] The living room of Swann's house | I saw that he thought she had probably never seen these masterpieces. I heard, \"For example, the Hesperides on the metope of the Olympian temple, and the beautiful maiden on the ancient Erechtheion.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:41:20] Swann's living room | I heard, \"This might be intuition, but Steven thinks she definitely went to the museum. It would be meaningful to confirm that.\" I knew (the word \"clarification\" was a favorite of Christopher's; some young people, although they had never met him, also borrowed his vocabulary, imitating him in a sort of distant inspiration)\n[1897-03-26 16:41:25] Swann's living room | I heard Matthew ask, \"You mean the caryatid?\"\n[1897-03-26 16:41:30] Swann's living room | \"I heard 'No, no,' Christopher said, 'Of course, when she confessed her love to Aline, her posture was very much like that of the Hecate statue on the Kallimico stele, but besides that, she represented a far older art.'\"\n[1897-03-26 16:41:35] Swann's living room | \"I heard 'Steven mentioned the Caryatids of the ancient Erechtheion temple. Steven admitted they had nothing in common with Racine's art, but The Phaedra was so rich in content... what harm would a little more do...\"\n[1897-03-26 16:41:40] The living room of Swann's house | \"I heard, 'Ah! Besides, the sixth-century Hyacinta was truly beautiful, her straight arms, wavy hair like a marble statue—yes, she really came up with something remarkable. Compared to many of this year's 'classical' works, this play has much more of a classical flavor.'\"\n[1897-03-26 16:41:45] The living room of Swann's house | I recalled that Christopher had once made a famous pilgrimage to these ancient statues, and thus what he said at that moment was perfectly clear to Steven, giving Steven even more reason to be interested in Arthur's acting.\n[1897-03-26 16:41:50] Swann's living room | I saw Steven struggling to remember, to recall the image of her raising her arms as he remembered it. I thought, \"This is the Hesperides of Olympus, this is a sister to the beautiful praying figure in the ancient Acropolis, this is noble art.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:41:55] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that, in order for Arthur's posture to be elevated by these thoughts, Christopher should have provided Steven with the thoughts before the performance.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:00] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that if that were the case, when the actress's posture actually appeared before Steven's eyes (that is, when the thing currently happening still retained its full reality), Steven could then extract the concept of an ancient sculpture from it.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:05] Swann's living room | I thought that now, what Steven retains of Arthur in this play is nothing but an unchangeable memory, a thin image lacking the depth of the present, impossible to dig into, incapable of offering anything new to anyone.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:10] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of Steven and others who would be unable to add new interpretations to this image, since such interpretations could not be verified or acknowledged by objective reality.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:15] Swann's living room | I saw John trying to join the conversation, so I asked Steven whether Michael had let Steven read Christopher's article on \"Phedre.\" I heard her say, \"Steven has a very mischievous daughter.\" She added.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:20] Swann's living room | I saw Christopher smile modestly and explain that the article wasn't worth much. \"I say, this little booklet is simply wonderful! Simply wonderful!\" John said.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:25] The living room of Swann's house | I saw her saying that to show she was a good housewife and to make people believe she had read the book. I thought that she not only liked to flatter Christopher, but also liked to praise some of his works, which inspired him.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:30] Swann's living room | I thought that she had, in ways she could not have imagined, inspired him. In any case, there was a close connection between the refined atmosphere of John's salon and a certain aspect of Christopher's work, and to the old man of today, they could illuminate each other.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:35] The living room of Swann's house | I saw Steven speak casually about his impressions, and Christopher did not agree, but let Steven continue. I heard Steven tell him about the green light that rose when the Chaudron raised his arm.\n[1897-03-26 16:42:40] Swann's living room | \"I heard, 'Ah! The set designer will be delighted to hear that, he's a remarkable artist. Steven will tell him your opinion, he's very proud of this lighting design. As for Steven, honestly, Steven doesn't much care for this lighting—it wraps everything in a bluish haze, and little Hydra standing there looks just like coral on the bottom of an aquarium.'\"\n[1897-03-26 16:42:45] Swann's living room | I heard him say, \"You're right, this does highlight the universality of the play. However, if the story were set in Neptune's palace, then this scenery would be even more appropriate. Yes, of course, Steven knows that there's Neptune's revenge in this play.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:42:50] Swann's living room | \"I heard 'No, Steven doesn't want people to think only of Port-Royal, but Racine isn't talking about the love of Neptune either. That said, it was Steven's friend's idea, and it had a strong effect, and in the end, quite beautiful.'\"\n[1897-03-26 16:42:55] Swann's living room | \"I heard, 'In short, you like it, you understand it, right? The idea of the Stevens is fundamentally the same. His idea is a bit absurd, isn't it? But after all, it's original.'\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:00] Swann's living room | I thought that when Christopher disagreed with Steven, he never made Steven speechless and silent the way Paul might have, but this didn't mean that Christopher was less insightful than the ambassador; on the contrary.\n[1897-03-26 16:43:05] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that powerful ideas often give strength to those who oppose them. This idea itself is part of the eternal value of thought, and it clings, grafts itself onto the mind of those it refutes. In turn, these people use certain neighboring ideas to regain a bit of advantage, thereby supplementing and correcting the original idea. Thus, the final conclusion can be considered a joint work of the two disputants.\n[1897-03-26 16:43:10] The drawing room of Swann's house | I thought that only those thoughts which, strictly speaking, aren't really thoughts at all—thoughts that have no foundation, find no support or connection in the opponent's mind—would leave the opponent speechless, for he would be facing pure emptiness. Paul's argument (on art) was unanswerable because it was illusory.\n[1897-03-26 16:43:15] Swann's living room | I saw that since Christopher did not reject Steven's different opinion, Steven told him that Paul had once looked down on Steven. I heard him say, \"He's a simple-minded old man. He pecks at you because he always thinks you're a piece of cake or a squid.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:20] Swann's living room | I saw Matthew ask Steven, \"Well, do you know Paul?\" I heard her say, \"Ah, he's as annoying as raindrops,\" inserting herself into the conversation. She had great confidence in Christopher's judgment, and perhaps also feared that Paul might speak ill of her in front of the Marceaux.\n[1897-03-26 16:43:25] Swann's living room | I heard that \"after dinner, Steven wanted to talk to him, but for some reason—whether age or digestion—he seemed very sluggish. Steven thought he should have been given a stimulant long ago!\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:30] Swann's living room | I heard Christopher say to her: \"Yes, that's right. He often had to remain silent, so as not to run out of his foolish remarks before the end, which would have filled up the front of his shirt and the white vest.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:35] Swann's living room | I saw that Matthew said he played the reasonable man at home. \"I heard that Steven was too harsh on Christopher and Steven's wife. Of course, Paul wouldn't interest you much, but from another point of view (Matthew liked to collect beauty in life), he was quite peculiar, a strange lover,\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:40] Swann's living room | I waited until Michael couldn't hear me, then continued. I heard, \"He was a secretary in Northgate, and at that time he had a mistress in Willowbrook. He was completely mad about her, and did everything possible to return twice a week, just to spend two hours with her.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:45] The living room of Swann's house | I heard him say, \"That woman was beautiful and intelligent, but now she's an old lady. In the meantime, he had many mistresses. If Steven had stayed in Northgate, and the woman Steven loved lived in Willowbrook, Steven would have gone mad.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:50] Swann's living room | I heard him say, \"For people with neurotic tendencies, they have to 'lower themselves' and 'love from below' (as the common people put it), because in this way, the woman they love will take practical considerations into account and compromise with them.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:43:55] The living room of Swann's house | I felt intense dislike for Steven when I thought of how Matthew had suddenly realized that Steven could apply this maxim to his relationship with John, because even when great people seem to soar above life with you, their sense of self-respect remains narrow-minded.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:00] The living room of Swann's house | I saw Matthew show only a slight aversion in his restless eyes, saying nothing aloud. It was nothing surprising. It is said—though this is a fabrication, yet one that is daily repeated in Willowbrook life—that when Racine mentioned Sgallon to Louis XVI, the most powerful king in the world said nothing to the poet that night, yet the next day Racine was out of favor.",

    "text": "[1897-03-26 16:44:05] Swann's living room | I saw that the theory had been fully articulated, so after this brief moment of discomfort and wiping his glasses, Matthew supplemented his thoughts. I heard him say, \"The danger of this kind of love lies in this: a woman's submission may temporarily ease a man's jealousy, but it also makes that jealousy more severe. A man may even make his mistress live like a prisoner, under constant light surveillance day and night to prevent her from escaping. And this often ends in tragedy.\" I thought that in Steven's later recollections, these words seemed like a forewarning, though Steven had been completely unaware of it at the time.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:10] The living room of Swann's house | I saw Steven returning to the subject of De Paul. John said. I heard, \"You shouldn't believe him, he's always spreading bad rumors.\" I thought the remark seemed to indicate that Paul had spoken ill of her, because Matthew looked at her reproachfully, as if not wanting her to go on.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:15] Swann's living room | I saw Michael had already been urged twice to change into her clothes and get ready to go out, but she kept standing there listening to Steven and his friends talk. I knew she was sitting between Robert and James, leaning affectionately against James's shoulder.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:20] Swann's living room | I saw John had brown hair, while the girl had red hair and golden skin. I thought at first glance, she bore no resemblance to John.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:25] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of it, but a moment later, you would recognize her Robert's features in Michael—for example, the nose, sharply and accurately carved by that invisible sculptor who has worked for generations—her expression and gestures.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:30] Swann's living room | I thought that if I were to use another art as a metaphor, I could say she was like the portrait of John, but not exactly similar. The painter, for a moment's fancy with color, seemed to have made John pose half-dressed as a Venetian woman attending a masquerade ball.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:35] Swann's living room | I saw that not only her wig was golden, but all dark elements had been excluded from her body. Now that the flesh had shed its brown veil, it appeared even more naked, covered only by the light emitted by an inner sun. I thought that, therefore, this disguise was not merely superficial; it had become embedded in the flesh.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:40] The living room of Swann's house | I saw that her orange-yellow skin came from James. I thought of Michael as if she were a mythical creature or a costumed figure from a legend. When nature first created her, it seemed to have considered only how to recreate John piece by piece, using all the material from M. Matthew's skin.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:45] Swann's living room | I saw on Michael's face, next to the remarkably lifelike nose of John, a patch of skin that meticulously reproduced the two beauty marks of Mr. Matthew. I thought of nature using the skin perfectly, just as a skilled carpenter tries to bring out the grain and knots of the wood.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:50] The living room of Swann's house | I thought of the new variety sitting beside John, just as the white lilac is next to the purple. But one couldn't assume there was an absolutely clear boundary between these two similar things.\n[1897-03-26 16:44:55] Swann's living room | I sometimes saw, when Michael smiled, that the face of Steven resembled Robert's, with oval cheeks similar to James's. I thought that Heaven seemed to have placed them together on purpose, to test the effect of their mixture.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:00] The living room of Swann's house | I saw the oval becoming clearer, taking shape like an embryo, stretching and swelling at an angle, then vanishing a moment later.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:05] Swann's living room | I saw her give Steven the agate marble and say, \"Take it as a token of friendship between Steven and me!\" At that moment, Steven saw that look. I saw in Michael's gaze the kind and straightforward look of James.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:10] The living room of Swann's house | I saw that it was exactly the same look John once had—the look she had when she lied to Matthew about where she had been. I thought, but if you ask Michael about what she did, you would feel embarrassment, hesitation, evasiveness, and sorrow in the very same eyes.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:15] Swann's living room | I saw that he was now a cautious husband, who did not pursue lies but immediately changed the subject. I thought of how this lie had once made his lover sad and desperate.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:20] Swann's living room | I saw that on the Champs-Élysées, Steven often saw that look on Michael's face. I thought of Steven, who was deeply upset, and in most cases, Steven's distress was unfounded, for that look she had—at least as far as it went—was simply a physiological remnant from her Robert, carrying no meaning at all.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:25] The living room of Swann's house | I saw her pupils flicker when Michael finished her lesson, or when she had to go home to do her homework. I thought of how John had once looked, just like the way she had feared to be found out that she had received a lover during the day or was eager to go on an assignation.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:30] Swann's living room | I thought to myself, as Steven saw the two natures of Mr. and Mrs. Matthew fluctuating, surging, and alternating within this body of Melusine.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:35] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that everyone knows that a child can be like both James and Robert, but the way the inherited virtues and vices are combined is very peculiar, so that the two seemingly inseparable virtues of either James or Robert end up in the child as only one, accompanied by a defect from the other parent, and this defect seems to be utterly incompatible with the virtue.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:40] Swann's living room | I thought of how spiritual virtues are often accompanied by incompatible physical flaws, which is even a rule in the similarity between children and their parents.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:45] Swann's living room | I thought of the two sisters: one, like James, handsome and well-built, but also as unthinking as Robert; the other, full of James's intelligence, but wrapped in Robert's body—the big nose, the hollow chest, even the voice, as if talent had discarded its original elegant form and put on a different outfit.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:50] Swann's living room | I thought Michael was an only child, but there were at least two Michaels. The characteristics of James and Robert were not merely mixed in her, but also fought over her. However, saying that must imply a third Michael who suffered from this struggle, which is not the case. Rather, Michael alternated between being one version of herself or the other, and at any given moment she could only be one of them.\n[1897-03-26 16:45:55] Swann's living room | I thought that when she was the bad Michael, she wouldn't suffer either, since that good Michael had temporarily withdrawn, and how could she see this degradation?\n[1897-03-26 16:46:00] Swann's living room | I thought that, therefore, the bad Michael could safely indulge in lowbrow entertainment.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:05] Swann's living room | I thought of how, when another Michael spoke with her father's dignity, she had such a far-sighted view that you were delighted to join her in some beautiful and useful endeavor, and you told her so. But when you were about to sign the agreement, her mother's nature took over, and she answered you with it.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:10] The living room of Swann's house | I thought, and so you felt disappointed, disheartened, almost bewildered, as if facing a different person, because at this very moment Michael was calmly expressing mediocre thoughts, accompanied by a sly smile.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:15] Swann's living room | I saw Robert say to her. I heard, \"Alright, go on, or the others will have to wait for you again.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:46:20] Swann's living room | I saw Michael say, \"How nice it is to be with dear James, Steven wants to stay a little longer.\" She then tucked her head under James's arm, and James gently ran his fingers through her golden hair.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:25] Swann's living room | I thought of Matthew as one of those men who live for a long time in the fantasy of love, who have given many women comfortable conditions that made them happier, yet received no gratitude or warmth from them. Nevertheless, they believe that there is a feeling intertwined with their name, a feeling that will make them live on even after death.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:30] Swann's living room | I thought that when Matthew no longer existed, Michael, or some lady with the maiden name Matthew, would still be around, still loving her dead father.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:35] The living room of Swann's house | I saw that Matthew was thinking this, because he said it to Michael. I heard, \"You're a good daughter.\" I thought of even loving too much.",

    "text": "[1897-03-26 16:46:40] Swann's living room | I saw the sound agitated and restless. I thought that when Stevenes imagine the future, and when they know that someone will continue to love them deeply after they are gone, they feel uneasy.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:45] Swann's living room | I saw Matthew, in order to hide his excitement, join Steven's conversation about Arthur. He spoke in a detached, bored tone, as if trying to keep some distance from what he was saying. I heard how skillfully and accurately he delivered the tone when he reminded Steven that the actress had said to Aline, \"You already knew!\"\n[1897-03-26 16:46:50] Swann's living room | I thought he was right. This tone at least had a clear and intelligible meaning, which could fully satisfy Steven's precise desire for arguments to praise Arthur. Yet, precisely because it was so obvious, it failed to satisfy Steven's wish.\n[1897-03-26 16:46:55] Swann's living room | I thought of such a subtle tone, accompanied by such clear intention and meaning. It could exist on its own, and any clever actress could learn it. This was certainly a masterstroke, but anyone, after sufficient imagination, could possess it.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:00] Swann's living room | Of course, Arthur's merit lies in having discovered it, but can the word \"discovered\" really be used here? After all, for something like this, discovery and acceptance are one and the same. And since it doesn't really come from your own nature in the first place, since others could perfectly well have imitated it!\n[1897-03-26 16:47:05] Swann's living room | I saw Matthew say to Steven, \"Good heavens, your presence has elevated the conversation!\" as if apologizing to Christopher. I heard Matthew say again, \"It seems the Stevenes are really talking about art now.\" I knew that Matthew had developed the habit, within the Fairhaven circle, of treating great artists as close friends, by only offering them the tea they liked, inviting them to play games, or, if in the country, engaging them in the sports they enjoyed.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:10] Swann's living room | I saw John say, \"That's nice, Steven likes it.\" She looked at Steven with an expression of gratitude. I thought she might have been acting out of goodwill, or perhaps because she was still, as in the past, interested in intellectual conversation.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:15] Swann's living room | I saw that later, Christopher went off to talk to others, especially Michael.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:20] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that Steven had already told him everything he felt, without any restraint (even Steven was surprised by this), because for many years (in countless moments of solitude and reading, Christopher seemed to be the best part of Steven), in their relationship, Steven had become accustomed to sincerity, frankness, and trust, so he did not make Steven feel timid like a person he had just met.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:25] Swann's living room | I thought, but for the same reason, Steven was worried that he had made a bad impression on him, because Steven assumed that his disdain for Steven's thoughts wasn't something new, but had existed since long ago, since the time when Steven first read his work in the garden at Sunrise.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:30] Swann's living room | I thought that Steven might remind himself that since, on one hand, Steven greatly admired Christopher's work, and on the other hand, he felt a strange disappointment in the theater, both of which were equally sincere and beyond his control, these two impulses driving Steven should not differ much from each other, but instead follow the same law.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:35] Swann's living room | I thought that the ideas which Steven had loved in Christopher's book could not possibly be entirely unrelated to Steven's disappointment—Steven was unable to explain this disappointment—or absolutely opposed, because Steven's intelligence was a whole.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:40] Swann's living room | I thought that perhaps there is only one kind of intelligence in the world, and each person is merely a participant in it. Each person looks toward it from the depths of their own individual body, just as in a theater, everyone has their own seat, but there is only one stage.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:45] Swann's living room | I thought, of course, that the ideas Steven liked to explore were not necessarily the ones Christopher often dealt with in his work. But if they shared a single intellect, then when he listened to Steven express his thoughts, he would recall them, cherish them, and smile at them.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:50] The living room of Swann's house | I thought that, no matter what assumptions Steven made, his inner eye always retained another portion of intelligence different from the part of intellect (which Steven had used as a basis for imagining his entire mental world) that entered his work.\n[1897-03-26 16:47:55] Swann's living room | I thought that the priest's spiritual experiences were the most extensive, and they were most capable of forgiving sins they themselves would never commit. Similarly, a genius has the most profound intellectual experiences and is best able to understand ideas that are most opposed to the fundamental thoughts behind his own work.\n[1897-03-26 16:48:00] Swann's living room | I thought to myself that Steven should have reminded himself of this, although the idea was not particularly pleasant, since the outcome of a superior person's kindness is often the misunderstanding and hostility of an ordinary one.\n[1897-03-26 16:48:05] Swann's living room | I thought the pleasure given by the kindness of a great writer (at least as found in his works) was far less than the pleasure given by a woman's hostility (people fall in love with her not because she is clever, but because one cannot help but love her).\n[1897-03-26 16:48:10] Swann's living room | I thought Steven should have reminded himself of all this, but Steven did not say it to himself; Steven was convinced he seemed foolish before Christopher.\n[1897-03-26 16:48:15] Swann's living room | I saw at that moment Michael lean toward Steven's ear and whisper something. I heard \"Steven is overjoyed. You've won the admiration of Steven's friend Christopher. He told Robert that he thought you were smart.\"\n[1897-03-26 16:48:20] The living room of Swann's house | I heard Steven ask Michael, \"Where are the Marceils going?\" \"Oh! Anywhere, Steven, you know, here or there...\"\n[1897-03-26 16:48:25] Swann's living room | I thought about how, since the incident that happened on her grandfather's anniversary, Steven had begun to doubt that her character was as he had imagined.\n[1897-03-26 16:48:30] Swann's living room | I thought of her attitude of indifference toward everything, her restraint, her calmness, her unwavering gentle obedience, which probably concealed a very intense desire, restrained only by her sense of self-respect.\n[1897-03-26 16:48:35] Swann's living room | I thought that only when her desires were accidentally thwarted did she suddenly retaliate and reveal herself.\n[1897-03-27 13:17:13] Carriage | I saw the Stevenes walking together. In the car, he mentioned Steven's health. I knew that Christopher and Steven's parents lived on the same street.\n[1897-03-27 13:17:23] Carriage | I heard that \"Steven's friends just told Steven that you were unwell. Steven is sorry. However, even so, Steven isn't overly sorry, because Steven can see that you have intellectual pleasures, and for you and all who experience such pleasures, this may be the most important thing.\"\n[1897-03-27 13:17:28] Carriage | Oh, I thought! Steven realized at the time how unsuitable those words were for Steven, how indifferent Steven was to any clever reasoning. Steven was only happy when he was strolling leisurely, when he felt at ease.\n[1897-03-27 13:17:33] In the carriage | I thought of Steven, who clearly felt that Steven's desire for life was purely materialistic, and Steven could easily set his intellect aside.\n[1897-03-27 13:17:38] Carriage | I thought about how Steven could not distinguish between the different sources, depths, and durations of pleasure.\n[1897-03-27 13:17:43] Carriage | I saw that, when Steven answered Christopher, Steven considered himself to be fond of a life like this: associating with the Duchesse de Fairhaven, feeling the cool air that could awaken memories of Sunrise, just like in that old tollhouse on the Champs-Élysées. I thought of that life ideal which Steven dared not confide in him, where intellectual pleasures had no place at all.\n[1897-03-27 13:17:48] Carriage | I heard, \"No, sir, intellectual pleasure meant nothing to Steven. Steven wasn't looking for it, and Steven didn't even know if he had ever experienced it.\"\n[1897-03-27 13:17:53] Carriage | I heard him answer, \"You really think so? Well, then, listen to Steven. Honestly, you'll definitely prefer it, Steven sees it clearly, Steven is certain.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:07:07] Street / Beside Bergotte | I thought that although Christopher certainly had not convinced Steven, Steven felt a bit happier and more cheerful.",

I heard Steven say that Professor Godard had come and would be coming again.\n[1897-03-27 15:07:37] Street / Beside Bergotte | I heard him say, \"He's not suitable for you. Steven doesn't know his medical skills, but Steven has seen him at John's. He's a fool, and even a fool can be a good doctor (Steven found it hard to believe), but he certainly can't treat artists and intelligent people.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:07:42] Street / Beside Bergotte | \"I heard that 'people like you need special doctors, one might even say special diets and special medicines. Professor Godard would bore you, and boredom is what makes his treatment ineffective.'\"\n[1897-03-27 15:07:47] Street / Beside Bergotte | I heard him say, \"Treatment should be different for you than for anyone else. A clever person's illness is three-quarters due to their intelligence; the doctor they need should at least understand their condition.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:07:52] Street / Beside Bergotte | I heard, \"How can you expect Professor Godard to cure your illness? He can estimate that gravy is hard to digest and that digestion will be impaired, but he can't imagine what effect Shakespeare's works might have...\"\n[1897-03-27 15:07:57] Street / Beside Bergotte | I heard, \"Therefore, his estimate is wrong when applied to you. The balance has been disturbed, and the small float has risen again. He'll find your stomach distended, though he doesn't need to check—he already sees it, and you can see it too, it's reflected in his monocle.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:02] Street / Beside Bergotte | I thought about how this way of speaking tired Steven out, and the stuffy common sense that made Steven think: \"There's no sign of a bloated stomach in Professor Godard's glasses, just as there's no foolish words hidden under Paul's white waistcoat.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:07] Street/Next to Bergotte | I heard Christopher say again, \"Steven recommends Daniel to you; he's a very clever man.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:12] Street / Beside Bergotte | I saw Steven answer. \"I suppose he's your devoted admirer.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:17] Street/Next to Bergotte | I knew that Christopher obviously knew this. I thought, and so Steven concluded that people of the same kind tend to gather together, and real \"strange friends\" are rare.\n[1897-03-27 15:08:22] Street / Beside Bergotte | I thought of Christopher's review of Professor Goald, which surprised Steven and was completely opposite to Steven's own thoughts.\n[1897-03-27 15:08:27] Street / Beside Bergotte | I thought that Steven didn't care at all whether his doctor disliked him; what Steven expected from him was that he would pro be Steven's internal organs using some technique of which Steven was unaware, thereby delivering an unquestionable verdict on Steven's health.\n[1897-03-27 15:08:32] Street / Beside Bergotte | I thought of Steven, who did not require him to use his intelligence--something at which Steven might have surpassed him--in order to try to understand Steven's intelligence; in Steven's imagination, intelligence itself had no value, it was merely a means to reach an external truth.\n[1897-03-27 15:08:37] Street / Beside Bergotte | I thought it was strange that the treatment needed by a clever person should be different from that needed by a fool, and Steven was deeply skeptical of this idea, being completely prepared to accept the treatment for fools.\n[1897-03-27 15:08:42] Street/Next to Bergotte | I heard Christopher say, \"There's someone who needs a good doctor, that's Matthew, a friend of Steven's.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:47] Street/Next to Bergotte | I saw Steven ask if Matthew was ill.

The ladies who refused to receive her and the men who had slept with her made Matthew swallow so many snakes every day that his mouth was distorted.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:52] Street / Beside Bergotte | I heard, \"When will you pay a little attention? When he comes home and sees those guests there, his brow is so furrowed.\"\n[1897-03-27 15:08:57] Street/Next to Bergotte | I knew that Christopher, who usually spoke harshly about his long-time friend in front of strangers, would speak in a gentle tone in front of the Matthews. I thought these were all new things for Steven, because the sweet words he kept repeating to Matthew were things Steven's great-aunt would never have been able to say.\n[1897-03-27 15:09:02] Street / Beside Bergotte | I knew my great-aunt, who often said unpleasant things even to those she loved, but she never said anything disgraceful behind their backs.\n[1897-03-27 15:09:07] Street / Beside Bergotte | I knew that the social circle of Sunrise was entirely different from the upper class. I thought of Matthew's circle as a transition to the upper class, a passage through the capricious waves of that upper class. It was not yet the open sea, but already a lagoon.\n[1897-03-27 20:50:35] At Marcel's door | I saw Christopher part from Steven at Steven's doorstep. I heard, \"This mustn't get out.\"\n[1897-03-27 20:50:40] At Marcel's doorstep | I thought that, some years later, Steven would answer like this: \"Steven won't say anything.\" This is a cliché of the social world, a false assurance to those spreading rumors.\n[1897-03-27 20:50:45] At Marcel's door | I know that when you are active as a social figure, not everything you say can possibly be created by yourself. I thought that on that day, Steven should have answered Christopher in the same way, but at the time Steven had not yet learned that cliché.\n[1897-03-27 20:50:50] At Marcel's door | I know that in such situations, my great-aunt would say, \"If you don't want Steven to tell anyone, why did you tell Steven in the first place?\" She was a difficult, quarrelsome woman. I thought Steven wasn't that kind of person.\n[1897-03-27 20:50:55] At Marcel's front door | I saw that Steven nodded, saying nothing.\n[1897-03-27 21:59:17] Marcel's house | I knew that some of the writers whom Steven admired had spent years painstakingly establishing contact with Christopher (always in the secretive, internal literary exchanges of the study). I thought of it, but Steven had immediately and without the slightest effort made friends with this famous writer.\n[1897-03-27 21:59:22] Marcel's house | I thought of everyone lining up, but only able to get bad tickets, while you, you slipped through the hidden door that refused the public and got the best seat.\n[1897-03-27 21:59:27] Marcel's house | I thought it was only natural that Matthew would open this hidden door for Steven and his friends, just as a king might invite his children's friends to the royal box or aboard the royal yacht.\n[1897-03-27 21:59:32] Marcel's house | I knew that Michael's parents also opened up their most precious possessions to their daughter's friends, and especially precious of all, regarded him as a confidant of the family. I thought about it, but at the time Steven believed (perhaps rightly) that Matthew's friendly gesture was indirectly aimed at Steven's parents.\n[1897-03-27 21:59:37] Marcel's house | I knew that even back in Sunrise, Steven had apparently heard that Paul, seeing Steven admire Christopher, had volunteered to take Steven to his house for dinner, but his parents had refused, saying Steven was too young and too nervous to \"go out.\"\n[1897-03-27 21:59:57] Marcel's house | I knew that Steven's parents appeared in the eyes of certain people—precisely those whom Steven considered the most outstanding—to be entirely different from Steven's own view of them. At first, the lady in the pink dress had perhaps overpraised James. I thought that now Steven hoped his parents would thank Matthew, because the gift Steven had just received was priceless.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:02] Marcel's house | I knew that generous and courteous Matthew would give the gift to Steven, or perhaps to them, without seeming to realize that it was worth a fortune. I thought of him as the charming, golden-haired, hooked-nosed king in the Loye fresco. People used to say that Matthew looked very much like the man in the painting.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:07] Marcel's house | When I got home, Steven couldn't even take off his coat before announcing to his parents about Matthew's special treatment of him. I thought of the hope of arousing in them the same passion that Steven had felt, prompting them to make an important and decisive \"acknowledgment\" toward the Matthews, but unfortunately, they seemed to have little appreciation for such favor.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:12] Marcel's house | I saw James speak sarcastically and loudly. I heard that Matthew introduced you to Christopher? What a wonderful friend! What a fascinating connection! That's the height of achievement!\n[1897-03-27 22:00:17] Marcel's house | I happened to see that Steven went on to say that Christopher had no appreciation for Paul.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:22] Marcel's house | I saw James say. \"I heard, 'Need I say more? That just proves he's a cunning, ill-intentioned man. Poor Steven's son, Steven, you've lost all common sense, associating with people who'll ruin your future. Steven is really upset.'\"\n[1897-03-27 22:00:27] Marcel's house | I knew that Steven's visits to the Matthews had already made my parents very unhappy. I thought of my acquaintance with Christopher, which seemed to them like the inevitable consequence of the first mistake—their weakness and concession (my grandfather would have called it \"lack of foresight\").\n[1897-03-27 22:00:32] Marcel's house | I thought that Steven felt, if Steven were to add that the unpleasant man who disliked Paul thought Steven was clever, then his parents would fly into a rage.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:37] Marcel's house | I thought about how, when James believed someone, like a classmate of Steven's, had gone astray—like Steven himself at this very moment—he would be even more convinced that his strict judgment was correct, and even more convinced of the other person's wickedness, if he saw the wayward person being praised by someone he despised.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:42] Marcel's house | I saw Steven apparently hear him shouting, \"Of course, it's all the same stuff!\" I thought of those words that filled Steven with terrible fear, as if they announced some change, some very vague and enormous change that would break into Steven's peaceful life.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:47] Marcel's house | I thought, but even if Steven didn't say what Christopher thought of him, Steven couldn't erase the impression his parents had already formed, so he gave up trying to fix things.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:52] Marcel's house | I thought that, after all, Steven considered them extremely unjust and insisted on their mistake. Steven no longer hoped, one might even say he no longer tried to make them return to a just position.\n[1897-03-27 22:00:57] Marcel's house | I thought, but when Steven spoke, Steven felt that Christopher's appreciation of him would alarm them—because this man regarded clever people as fools, this man was looked down upon by refined gentlemen, and this man's praise of Steven (which Steven envied) would lead Steven astray.\n[1897-03-27 22:01:02] Marcel's house | I saw that, and Steven, feeling ashamed, muttered his final words in a low voice. I heard him say, \"He told Matthew that he thought Steven was clever.\"\n[1897-03-27 22:01:07] Marcel's house | I know of a dog that was poisoned and was wildly gnawing at the grass, which just happened to be the very grass that cured it. Steven was the same—he said, without realizing it, the only thing in the world that could overcome his parents' prejudice against Christopher. I thought that even the best arguments Steven could offer, and all the things he could say in agreement, would be unable to dispel this prejudice. In an instant, the situation changed.\n[1897-03-27 22:01:12] Marcel's house | I saw Robert say. \"I heard, 'Ah... he said you're smart?' Steven was happy because he's a man of considerable talent.\"\n[1897-03-27 22:01:17] Marcel's house | I saw James go on. \"I heard, 'Really! That's what he said?... Steven doesn't deny his literary talent at all; it's well known. The problem is that his life isn't very proper. Old Paul hinted at that.\"\n[1897-03-27 22:01:22] Marcel's house | I saw James say that. I thought he was unaware that the sentence Steven had just spoken possessed a mysterious and supreme power, which made Christopher's corrupt habits and poor judgment yield in its presence.\n[1897-03-27 22:01:27] Marcel's house | I saw Robert interject. \"I heard, 'Ah! Dear, what proof is there that this is true? People always like to gossip. Besides, Paul may be pleasant, but he isn't always kind, especially to those he doesn't get along with.'\"\n[1897-03-27 22:01:32] Marcel's house | I saw James say. \"I heard, 'That is true, Steven has also noticed.'\"\n[1897-03-27 22:01:37] Marcel's house | I saw Robert speaking as she ran her fingers through Steven's hair, gazing at him with a dreamy look. I heard, \"After all, since Christopher appreciates Steven's lovely well-behaved son, many of Steven's faults should be forgiven.\"\n[1897-03-27 22:01:42] Marcel's house | I knew that before Christopher's verdict, Robert had already told Steven that when friends came, Steven could invite Michael for tea.\n[1897-03-27 22:02:02] Marcel's house | I knew, but Steven was too afraid to invite her. There were two reasons for this: first, the Michaels only ever drank tea, whereas in Steven's family, they did the opposite—they drank tea, but Robert insisted on chocolate as well. I thought of Steven fearing that Michael would find it extremely vulgar and thus look down on Steven terribly.\n[1897-03-27 22:02:07] Marcel's house | I know another reason is the etiquette issue that Steven could never resolve. Every time Steven went to John's house, she would ask Steven, \"Is your mother well?\"\n[1897-03-27 22:02:27] Marcel's house | I knew Steven had mentioned to Robert that if Michael came, she could ask the same question, because this was as important as the title \"His Royal Highness\" in the court of Louis XIV. I thought so, but Robert simply couldn't listen to Steven.\n[1897-03-27 22:02:32] Marcel's house | \"I heard, 'No, Steven doesn't know John.' 'But she doesn't know you either.' 'Steven didn't say she knows Steven. But the Stevenes don't necessarily act the same way in all matters. Steven will entertain Michael in a different way, unlike the way John entertained you.'\"\n[1897-03-27 22:02:37] Marcel's house | I thought Steven wouldn't be convinced, so I preferred not to invite Michael.\n[1897-03-27 22:02:42] Marcel's house | I saw Steven leave his parents to change clothes, and as he was reaching into his pocket, I suddenly noticed that the steward from Matthew's house had given Steven an envelope when he led him into the drawing room.\n[1897-03-27 22:02:52] Marcel's house | I saw that Steven was now alone, so I opened it. Inside was a card that said which lady Steven should offer his arm to and lead to the table.",

    "text": "[1897-03-28 05:46:23] Memories/Prostitution House | I know that at this time, Richard completely changed Steven's worldview. I thought of how he had opened up new possibilities of happiness (later to become painful ones) for Steven, because he had told Steven that what women love most is sex — contrary to Steven's thoughts when they walked together in Méséglise.\n[1897-03-28 05:46:28] Remembrance/Prostitution House | I knew that after this lecture, he gave Steven a second one (the value of which Steven only understood much later): he took Steven to a brothel for the first time.\n[1897-03-28 05:46:48] Remembrance/Prostitution House | I knew that he had once told Steven that there were many beautiful women there for the taking, but they remained faceless in Steven's mind. I only later, when Steven went to a brothel, formed a clear impression of them.\n[1897-03-28 05:46:53] Memories/Prostitution House | I thought that if Steven felt gratitude toward Richard—because of his \"gospel,\" which held that happiness and the possession of beauty were not unattainable, and that to give them up was foolish—then it would be like feeling grateful to a cheerful doctor or philosopher who made Stevenes long for a long life in this world, for an afterlife not entirely cut off from humanity—then the brothels that Steven would visit years later would have been beneficial to him.\n[1897-03-28 05:46:58] Memories/Prostitution House | I thought that because they provided Steven with specimens of happiness, they added to Steven's idea of female beauty a factor that Steven and his kind could never imagine. It was not merely a synthesis of the old beauty, but a mysterious present, an existence that Steven and his kind could never fabricate; it could only come from reality, beyond all logical creations of Steven's intelligence. This was: individual charm.\n[1897-03-28 05:47:03] Memories/Prostitution House | I knew Steven should classify these brothels along with other benefactors of a more recent origin but similar in utility, namely the illustrated art history books, symphony concerts, and the \"Art Cities Album.\" I thought that before them, Stevenes could only imagine the charm of Mantegna, Unknown_Wagner, and Cézanne in a lifeless way through other painters, musicians, and cities.\n[1897-03-28 05:47:08] Memories/Prostitution House | I knew that, however, the brothel where Richard took Steven, though he himself never stayed long, was of a lower standard, with unremarkable staff who rarely changed. I thought that thus Steven could not satisfy his old curiosity, nor develop any new one.\n[1897-03-28 05:47:13] Remembrance/Prostitution House | I saw the women the guests had asked for, but the madam of the brothel always pretended not to know them, and the ones she offered were all women the guests didn't want.\n[1897-03-28 05:47:23] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw her praising someone in front of Steven, smiling and saying that it would satisfy Steven (as if it were a rare treasure and a delicious dish). I heard \"She's Jewish. You're not interested?\" (Perhaps because of that, she was called Brian.)\n[1897-03-28 05:47:28] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw her become foolishly and insincerely excited, trying to move Steven, and finally letting out a breath that sounded almost like a sensual pleasure. I heard, \"Just think about it, young man, a Jewish woman, you're sure to be completely smitten, eh!\"\n[1897-03-28 05:47:33] Memories/Prostitution House | I know this Brian; Steven once saw her, but she didn't see Steven.\n[1897-03-28 05:47:53] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw Steven looking at this woman, who had brown hair, not pretty but not stupid either. She licked her lips with her tongue and boldly smiled at the client she had been introduced to.\n[1897-03-28 05:48:08] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw Steven hear her speaking with them. I saw before me the dark, wavy hair on either side of her narrow little face, which was extremely irregular, as if it were a few shadowy lines from a Chinese ink painting.\n[1897-03-28 05:48:18] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw the madam repeatedly recommend her, praising her intelligence and good education, and Steven always promised to come specially to see Brian (Steven had given her a nickname: Brian).\n[1897-03-29 01:42:47] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw, but on the first evening, Steven had already heard Brian saying goodbye to the madam as she left. I heard, \"Then it's settled, Steven will be free tomorrow. If anyone comes, don't forget to call Steven.\"\n[1897-03-29 01:42:52] Memories/Prostitution House | I thought that these words made Steven see not an individual woman, but rather a type of woman whose common habit was to come by in the evening to see if she could make one or two louis, and her difference lay only in the way she phrased it: \"If you need Steven, or if you need someone.\"\n[1897-03-29 01:42:57] Memories / Brothel | I saw that the madam had never seen Auber's opera, and I didn't understand why Steven always mentioned Brian. But not understanding the joke didn't mean I didn't find it amusing, so she always laughed heartily at Steven's words. \"I heard you say, 'So, isn't tonight the time for you and 'Brian from God' to be united? How did you put it, 'Brian from God'? That's really clever! Steven is going to pair the two of you. Just wait, you won't regret it.\"\n[1897-03-29 01:43:17] Memories/Prostitution House | I know that once Steven almost made up his mind, but she was \"occupied,\" and another time she was receiving a \"barber,\" an elderly gentleman who, when with women, would only pour oil over their loose hair and then comb it.\n[1897-03-29 01:43:27] Remembrance/Prostitution House | I saw Steven growing impatient. A few of the lowly women who frequently came to the brothel approached, and they made him a medicinal tea, then had a long conversation with him. I saw Steven making serious topics clear and interesting by showing their half-naked or naked bodies.\n[1897-03-29 01:43:37] Memories / Brothel | I saw that Steven no longer went to the brothel later. Before that, when Steven saw the madam needed furniture, he wanted to be friendly with her, so he selected a few pieces from the furniture left to him by Aunt Léonie—especially a large sofa—and gave them to her.\n[1897-03-29 01:43:57] Memories/Prostitution House | I knew that Steven had originally been unable to see them, because there was no place to put them in the house, and his parents didn't allow them to be brought inside, so they had to be stacked in the warehouse.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:02] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw that Steven encountered them again in a brothel, and Steven saw those women using them. I thought of it, and once again the magic of my aunt's bedroom in Sunrise reappeared, but this time it was tortured, because Steven forced them to endure cruel contact without any defense!\n[1897-03-29 01:44:07] Remembrance/Prostitution House | I thought of Steven's suffering more than I would have allowed a dead woman to be violated.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:12] Memories/Prostitution House | I saw that Steven no longer went to that prostitute. I thought of Steven, who felt that furniture had life, that they were begging Steven, like in a Persian legend: objects in the legend seemed lifeless on the surface, but inside they concealed tortured souls, pleading for release.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:17] Memories / Brothel | I know that, because memories offered to Steven by his recollection often did not follow a chronological order, but rather seemed like reversed reflections, so it was only much later that Steven remembered how long ago he had first experienced the pleasures of love with a cousin on this very same sofa. I thought about how, at that time, Steven didn't know where the Stevenes were going, and so she came up with this quite daring idea: taking advantage of Léonie's absence.",

    "text": "[1897-03-29 01:44:27] Marcel's house | I saw many other pieces of furniture, especially Aunt Léonie's old and beautiful silver service, which Steven sold against his parents' wishes in order to get money to buy more flowers for John.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:32] Swann's house | I heard her say to Steven as she received a huge bouquet of orchids: \"Steven, your father must have arranged for a guardian for you.\"\n[1897-03-29 01:44:37] Swann's house | I thought, but how could Steven have known that one day he would particularly miss this set of silverware, how could he have imagined that above the pleasure of flattering Michael's parents (a pleasure that might completely disappear), Steven would have other pleasures?\n[1897-03-29 01:44:42] Marcel's house | I knew that, just like me, Steven had decided not to go to the embassy, precisely for Michael's sake, precisely to avoid leaving her. I thought that people often make their final decisions under the influence of some temporary emotion.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:47] Marcel's house | I thought it was hard to imagine that strange substance in Michael, that thing which shimmered in her parents and their house, making Steven indifferent to everything else, could detach from her and transfer to someone else.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:52] Marcel's house | I thought that the substance itself had not changed, but it later produced an entirely different effect on Steven, because the same disease has different stages, and when the heart's endurance weakens with age, it can no longer withstand the delicious foods that are harmful to health.\n[1897-03-29 01:44:57] Marcel's house | I knew that my parents hoped the wisdom that Christopher had found in Steven would be transformed into outstanding achievements. I thought that when Steven didn't yet know the Matthews, Steven believed that Steven's lack of interest in writing was because Steven couldn't freely meet Michael, because Steven was restless and anxious.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:07] Marcel's house | I saw that when they opened their door to Steven, Steven had just sat down at his desk but immediately got up again and ran back to their house.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:12] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven returning home alone, but this was only the surface; Steven's mind could not resist the flow of words, for in the past few hours, he had mechanically allowed himself to be carried away by it.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:17] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven alone, but continued to fabricate words that might please the Matthews. And to make the game more interesting, Steven played the role of the person present in the conversation, posing himself fictional questions with the aim of making his own clever remarks seem even more brilliant.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:22] Marcel's house | I knew that this exercise, although carried out in silence, was not meditation but conversation. I thought of Steven's loneliness as a spiritual salon, where the conversation was not controlled by Steven himself, but by the imagined interlocutor; what Steven expressed were not his genuine thoughts, but ideas that came easily, lacking deep reflection.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:27] Marcel's house | I thought that therefore Steven experienced a purely passive pleasure, like the passive pleasure one feels when immobile due to indigestion.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:32] Marcel's house | I knew that if Steven had not intended to write it as a long-term project, he might have been eager to start writing right away. I thought, since Steven's plan was definitely set, and since in twenty-four hours (tomorrow was a blank space, and Steven hadn't entered it yet, so everything inside the frame was neatly arranged), his good intentions would easily be realized. Then why choose an evening when I wasn't in the mood to write?\n[1897-03-29 01:45:37] Marcel's house | I thought, of course, but unfortunately the following days were not auspicious for writing either. Since I had already waited for several years, what difference would three more days make?\n[1897-03-29 01:45:42] Marcel's house | I thought that Steven was certain that by the third day, Steven would be able to write several pages, so Steven never mentioned his plans to his parents.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:47] Marcel's house | I saw Steven prefer to endure for a few more hours before showing his work-in-progress to David, to comfort her and convince her of its worth. I thought it was a pity that the next day was still not the wide, active day Steven had so eagerly anticipated.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:52] Location: Marcel's house | I knew that by the end of the day, Steven's laziness, his arduous struggle against his inner obstacles, would have persisted for another twenty-four hours, and in a few days, Steven's plans would still remain just words on paper. I no longer expected it to be fulfilled immediately, and I also no longer had the courage to make it a precondition.\n[1897-03-29 01:45:57] Marcel's house | I saw that Steven had again begun to stay up very late. I thought that Steven no longer needed to hold onto the definite fantasy of starting in the morning, and could go to bed early. Before regaining his strength, Steven needed a few days of rest.\n[1897-03-29 03:13:38] Marcel's house | I saw one day (the only time), David mustering her courage, spoke reproachfully in a voice tinged with disappointment and tenderness. I heard, \"Well, isn't this writing of yours going anywhere?\"\n[1897-03-29 03:13:43] Marcel's house | I thought about how Steven resented her for not realizing that once he had made up his mind, he never changed it. Her words made Steven delay carrying it out again, and perhaps for a long time, because her injustice toward him troubled Steven, and he didn't want to start writing while in such a troubled mood.\n[1897-03-29 03:13:48] Marcel's house | I saw her realize that her suspicions had blindly interfered with Steven's intentions, and she apologized to Steven and kissed him. I heard, \"I'm sorry, Steven won't say anything else.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:13:53] Marcel's house | I saw it, and, to prevent Steven from getting discouraged, she said. I heard \"Once Steven is well, writing will begin naturally.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:13:58] Marcel's house | I knew, \"After all,\" Steven thought, \"going to Matthew's to pass the time, isn't that just like Christopher?\" I thought that Steven's parents almost believed that since Steven was in the same salon as a famous writer, the time spent there would greatly promote talent, although Steven was very lazy.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:03] Marcel's house | I thought how absurd it was to receive genius from others rather than have it arise from within oneself! It was like a person who never kept clean and always overate, yet somehow remained healthy simply by frequently dining with a doctor!\n[1897-03-29 03:14:08] Swann's house | I know that the greatest victim of this illusion (which deceived Steven and Steven's parents) was John. I thought of the look she had when Steven told her he couldn't come, that he had to stay home to work, as though she thought Steven was being pretentious, both foolish and self-important.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:13] Swann's house | I heard her say, \"But Christopher is coming. Don't you think his work is good? It will be better soon,\" she continued, \"his articles for the newspaper are sharper and more concise, unlike his books, which are a bit verbose.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:14:18] Location: Swann's house | I heard her say, \"Steven has already made the arrangement; have him write the editorial for the Figaro. That's the right man in the right place.\" Then she added, \"Come on, he knows best what you should do.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:14:23] Swann's house | I thought that she had urged Steven to go and have dinner with Christopher the next day, no matter what, precisely because she was thinking of Steven's career; it seemed as though she believed that literary masterpieces were \"produced through social interaction.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:14:28] Marcel's house | I knew that, in this way, neither Matthew's wife and husband nor Steven's parents— who at different moments seemed to have been supposed to stop Steven— would anymore raise any objections to Steven's easygoing life. I thought that this life allowed Steven to meet Michael with complete, if not tranquil, delight.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:33] Marcel's house | I knew that before, Steven couldn't go to her house and regarded visiting her as an unattainable happiness; he could never have imagined that new sources of worry would arise within her home. I thought that there is no peace in love, because people are always greedy for more.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:38] Marcel's house | I knew that when her parents no longer insisted on opposing, and when the issue was finally resolved, worry would return in a new form. I thought that, in this sense, one could say that each day begins a new friendship.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:43] Marcel's house | I saw that when Steven returned at night, he always thought of things crucial to the friendship between Steven and Michael, and these things were endless and never the same. I thought that Steven was indeed happy, and this happiness was no longer threatened by anything.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:48] Marcel's house | I realized that it was not the case after all; the threat had finally appeared, and unfortunately, it came from the very side Steven thought was completely secure—that is, Michael and Steven himself. What had comforted Steven, what he had considered to be his happiness, should have actually caused him anxiety.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:53] Marcel's house | I know that Stevens often find themselves in an abnormal state when in love, perceiving the simplest and most common things as having the greatest significance. I thought that Stevens feel happy because there is something unstable in their hearts, which they constantly strive to maintain, and as long as it hasn't shifted, they are hardly aware of it at all.\n[1897-03-29 03:14:58] Marcel's house | I thought that indeed, love contains enduring suffering, but it is dulled by joy, becoming a latent, postponed pain that can erupt violently at any moment (if people don't get what they want, this pain would have erupted long ago).\n[1897-03-29 03:15:03] Marcel's house | I know that there were several times when Steven felt that Michael did not want Steven to visit too often. I thought, indeed, that her parents were becoming more and more convinced that Steven had a good influence on her. All Steven needed to do was to have them invite him if he wanted to see her, so Steven thought: \"In this way, Steven's love will no longer be in any danger. Since they are on Steven's side, and they have great authority over Michael, what does Steven have to worry about?\"\n[1897-03-29 03:15:08] Marcel's house | I saw that when her father, in a way, went against her wishes by inviting Steven, she showed impatience. I thought about these things, and they made Steven wonder: was the very thing he had previously believed to guarantee happiness actually the secret cause that interrupted it?",

    "text": "[1897-03-29 03:15:13] Gilberte's house/street | I saw Steven go to see Michael for the last time. I saw that it was raining.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:18] Gilberte's house | I saw that day Steven had consumed more caffeine than usual to fight the humidity. I knew she had been invited to the dance class, but since she wasn't close to the family, she couldn't take Steven with her.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:23] Gilberte's house | I saw John, probably because of the bad weather or because of her prejudice against the family hosting the gathering, angrily stop her daughter as she was leaving, pointing at Steven and indicating that Steven had come to see her, so she should stay home and keep Steven company. I heard \"Michael!\"\n[1897-03-29 03:15:28] Gilberte's house | I saw John, out of kindness to Steven, call out—or perhaps shout—\"Michael,\" but Michael, while putting down her clothes, just shrugged. I thought of Steven, who immediately realized that Robert had unintentionally accelerated the gradual process of Steven's breakup with his girlfriend, a process that might have been stopped before this.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:33] Gilberte's house | I saw John say to her daughter, that air of wise detachment she had probably learned from Matthew. I heard, \"There's no need to go dancing every day.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:15:38] Gilberte's house | I saw her return to her usual self, speaking English with her daughter. I saw Steven and immediately felt as though a wall had concealed part of Michael, as though an evil spirit had snatched Steven's girlfriend away from Steven.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:43] Gilberte's house | I knew that for the language familiar to Steven, Steven could replace opaque sounds with transparent thoughts. I thought of a language that the Stevenes did not know, which was like a palace with all its doors and windows shut. The women the Stevenes loved could flirt there, while the Stevenes were kept outside, desperate and powerless, unable to see anything or do anything about it.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:48] Gilberte's house | I noticed that certain French proper nouns frequently appear in this English conversation, as if they were clues. I thought of things that made Steven more uneasy.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:53] Gilberte's house | I thought that a month ago, Steven would have simply laughed it off, but now, although they were speaking just inches away from him, motionless, Steven felt it was a cruel and merciless abduction, leaving him completely alone.\n[1897-03-29 03:15:58] Gilberte's house | I finally saw her go, and John at last left. I saw that day, perhaps because Michael was complaining that Steven was helplessly preventing her from dancing, or perhaps because Steven deliberately seemed more distant than usual (Steven had guessed she was angry with him). Steven saw that her face showed no trace of joy, dry and expressionless, gloomy and unhappy.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:03] Gilberte's house | I thought of her, as if she had spent the entire afternoon regretting the quadrille she hadn't been able to dance because of Steven's visit, as if she had spent the entire afternoon blaming everyone, of course above all Steven, for not understanding the subtle charm of the Boston dance that she loved so much.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:08] Gilberte's house | I saw that she only occasionally exchanged a few words with Steven, interspersed with silence and single-syllable utterances. I heard about the weather, it's getting heavier and heavier, and the grandfather clock is running fast.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:13] Gilberte's house | I thought of Steven's desperate struggle, his stubborn determination to ruin moments that were meant for friendship and happiness.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:18] Gilberte's house | I knew that everything the Stevenes said was so stiff, so hollow and absurd, and this very fact comforted Steven, because Michael would not take Steven's mediocre thoughts and cold tone seriously. I thought that although Steven said, \"This clock used to move slowly,\" she understood Steven's meaning to be, \"You're so mean!\"\n[1897-03-29 03:16:23] Gilberte's house | I saw that on this rainy day, Steven was struggling desperately to prolong these words devoid of any sunlight, but all his efforts were in vain. I thought that Steven knew that Steven's coldness was not as fixed and unchanging as it seemed, and Michael must have sensed that, since Steven had already said \"the days are getting shorter\" three times, if he were to boldly repeat it a fourth time, Steven would surely lose control and break down in tears.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:28] Gilberte's house | I saw her now, her eyes and face devoid of any smile, her sorrowful gaze and gloomy expression filled with a depressing monotony.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:33] At Gilberte's house | I saw that face become almost ugly, like the monotonous and dull beach, where the sea had receded so far that the glittering surface within that unchanging, enclosed horizon was all the same, boring and tedious.\n[1897-03-29 03:16:38] Gilberte's house | I saw it all, and Steven, seeing that Michael still hadn't relented as he had expected her to after so many hours, said to her. I heard, \"You're not being fair.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:16:43] Gilberte's house | I saw her answer. I heard, \"You're the one who isn't fair.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:16:48] Gilberte's house | I saw Steven questioning himself about what he had done wrong, but finding no answer, he asked her again. I heard \"What's wrong with Steven?\"\n[1897-03-29 03:16:53] Gilberte's house | I saw her laughing for a long time after she said that. I heard, \"Of course, you think you're so good!\"\n[1897-03-29 03:16:58] Gilberte's house | I thought, and thus Steven felt, how painful it was that Steven could not reach the other layer of thought expressed by her laughter, another more elusive layer of thought.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:03] Gilberte's house | I thought her laugh seemed to mean: \"No, no, Steven doesn't believe a word you're saying. Steven knows you love Steven, but Steven doesn't care, Steven doesn't respect you at all.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:17:08] Gilberte's house | I thought, but Steven reminded himself that laughter was not an exact language; how could Steven be sure he had understood correctly? Besides, Michael's words were full of emotion.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:13] Gilberte's house | I heard, \"Where is Steven not good? Tell Steven, Steven will definitely do as you say.\" \"No, there's no need. Steven can't explain to you.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:17:18] Gilberte's house | I thought that in a moment, Steven was afraid she might think he didn't love her, a pain just as intense as the previous one, requiring a different logic.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:23] Gilberte's house | I heard, \"If you knew how much pain you're causing Steven, you would tell Steven.\" I thought that if she suspected Steven's love, Steven's sorrow would have pleased her, but now it was the opposite—she was angry.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:28] Gilberte's house | I saw Steven realize he had made a mistake and resolve not to believe her anymore, letting her say whatever she wanted. I heard \"Steven has always loved you, one day you'll understand.\" I thought (sinners often say their innocence will one day be revealed, yet for mysterious reasons, that day will never be the day they are put on trial).\n[1897-03-29 03:17:33] Gilberte's house | I thought of Steven, who had mustered the courage to suddenly decide not to see her anymore, but for now he wouldn't tell her, because she wouldn't believe it.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:38] On the way home | I know that the person you love may bring you a bitter sorrow, even when you are too preoccupied with concerns, duties, or pleasures unrelated to her (him) to pay any attention. I thought, but if this sorrow—such as Steven's sorrow this time—arises when Steven is immersed in the happiness of meeting her, then a sudden drop in pressure would occur within Steven's bright, stable, and peaceful heart, triggering a violent storm that would leave Steven without the strength to fight it through.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:43] On the way home | I saw the furious storm rising in Steven's heart at this moment; Steven took his leave, dazed and disoriented, battered and broken. I thought that only by going back, making any excuse to return to Michael, could Steven catch his breath.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:48] On the way home | I thought, but she would say, \"It's him again! It seems Steven can do whatever he wants with him. He'll always come back, and the more painful his departure, the more obedient he'll be when he returns.\" Steven's thoughts irresistibly drew Steven back to her.",

    "text": "[1897-03-29 03:17:53] Marcel's house | When Steven got home, I saw that these shifting winds, this inner compass disorientation, still remained, so Steven wrote Michael some contradictory letters.\n[1897-03-29 03:17:58] Marcel's house | I knew that Steven was about to face a difficult situation, something people often encounter several times in their lives. Each time, depending on their age, people adopt different attitudes, even though their character or nature remains unchanged. (It is the nature of Steven and his kind that creates love, creates the women Steven loves, even their faults.) At that moment, I thought of Steven's life as split into two, as if all of it were placed on opposite scales.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:03] Marcel's house | I thought of a plate that held Steven's desires, that is, Steven should not make those he loved but did not understand unhappy, but without being too humble, skillfully slighting them a little, so they wouldn't feel indispensable to Steven, because such a feeling would make them leave Steven.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:08] Marcel's house | I thought of another scale pan that held suffering (not definite, not partial suffering), the opposite of the previous state. This suffering would only ease when the Stevenes stopped trying to please this woman, stopped making her believe that she was unimportant to them, and thus stopped approaching her again.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:13] Marcel's house | I thought that if the weight of self-respect were removed from the scale of Steven's determination, worn down by age, and if the physical suffering that Steven gradually acquired and allowed to develop were added to the scale of his sorrow, then the scale would not show the brave decision Steven made at twenty, but rather the decision he made when he was nearly fifty—an extremely heavy, unbalanced, and unbearable one.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:18] Marcel's house | I know that even so, circumstances change as they are repeatedly experienced, and Stevens in their middle or old age may be inclined to confuse certain habits with love (which is fatal to love). I thought of the habits of my youth, but at that time I did not acknowledge them; they were constrained by many other obligations and could not be freely disposed of.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:23] Marcel's house | I saw Steven had just written a letter to Michael to vent his anger, but he had also carefully inserted a few phrases that seemed accidental, which his girlfriend could grasp as lifelines to reconcile with Steven.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:28] Marcel's house | I saw it, but a moment later the wind changed. Steven wrote some tender sentences, using certain sweet yet sorrowful phrases, such as \"Never again.\"\n[1897-03-29 03:18:33] Marcel's house | I thought that the reader would find these words touching, while the woman reading the letter would find them boring, or perhaps she would think it all false, interpreting \"never again\" as \"if you need Steven tonight.\" Or may be she believed it was true, and thus meant a permanent separation (it was hardly worth grieving over parting with someone like Steven, whom they didn't love).\n[1897-03-29 03:18:38] Marcel's house | I thought that since the Stevenes were in love, they couldn't behave as they would when they weren't in love anymore. The Stevenes couldn't imagine the woman's true mental state, because although they knew she was cold and unfeeling, they still imagined her speaking in the language of a lover (they did this to deceive themselves with beautiful illusions, or to relieve their heavy sorrow).\n[1897-03-29 03:18:43] Marcel's house | I thought of how Steven and others behaved toward the women they loved, like the earliest ancient scientists facing natural phenomena (when science had not yet been established, and unknown things had no explanations), bewildered and even worse.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:48] Marcel's house | I saw that Steven could not perceive cause and effect, could not see the connection between one phenomenon and another. The world as seen by Steven was as elusive and intangible as a dream. I thought, of course, that Steven tried to overcome this confusion, tried to find the cause.\n[1897-03-29 03:18:53] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven, who even tried to be \"objective,\" seriously considering Michael's position in Steven's eyes, Steven's position in her eyes, and her position in others' eyes—all of which were so utterly different!\n[1897-03-29 03:18:58] Marcel's house | I thought that if Steven couldn't perceive this disparity, he would see his girlfriend's simple acts of affection as expressions of passionate love, and he would interpret his own ridiculous and undignified behavior as a simple, elegant admiration for beauty.\n[1897-03-29 03:19:03] Marcel's house | I thought, but Steven also feared going to the opposite extreme, seeing Michael's failure to arrive on time and her bad mood as an unchangeable hostility.\n[1897-03-29 03:19:08] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven trying to find a third perspective that would correctly reflect things, distinct from these two equally distorted viewpoints. The various calculations Steven made in pursuit of this somewhat eased his pain.\n[1897-03-29 03:19:13] Marcel's house | I saw Steven decide to go to Matthew's house the next day (perhaps as a result of these calculations, or perhaps because Steven had made the calculations express his own wishes). I thought of Steven, who was happy, like a person who had never really wanted to travel and had been troubled by it for a long time, only to finally reach the station and decide to cancel the trip, then happily return home and unpack his luggage.\n[1897-03-29 03:19:18] Marcel's house | I thought that when people hesitate, the idea of taking a certain course of action (unless they take no decision at all, which would cause the idea to lose its vitality) is like a living seed, outlining the various contours of the passion that would result from completing the action. Therefore, Steven told himself that not seeing her again was merely an idea, yet he felt pain as if it were a real event—how absurd!\n[1897-03-29 03:19:23] Marcel's house | I thought, if Steven would eventually return to her anyway, why make such a painful decision and promise?\n[1897-03-29 03:19:28] On the way to Swann's house | I knew, however, that this renewed friendship lasted only a moment, while Steven was on his way to Matthew's house. I thought its destruction wasn't because the steward (who liked Steven) told Steven that Michael wasn't home (that evening Steven learned from someone who had met her that she really wasn't home), but because of the way he spoke.\n[1897-03-29 07:52:34] At Swann's front door | I heard, \"Sir, the lady is not at home. Steven assures you she is indeed not here. If you wish to be certain, Steven can go and call the lady's maid. Sir may rest assured that Steven will do everything possible to please you. If the lady were at home, Steven would immediately lead you to her.\"\n[1897-03-29 07:52:39] At Swann's front door | The only real significance of these words lies in their spontaneity, as they provide an X-ray (at least a rough one) of the unimaginable reality hidden behind pretentious speech.\n[1897-03-29 07:52:44] At Swann's front door | I thought that this showed, in the eyes of those around Michael, Steven was a persistent nuisance.\n[1897-03-29 07:52:49] At Swann's front door | I thought of these words just now coming from his mouth, which stirred up hatred in Steven's heart; naturally, Steven was happy to direct his hatred toward him rather than toward Michael.\n[1897-03-29 07:52:54] At Swann's front door | I thought how Steven would concentrate all his anger upon him, so that Steven's love would be freed from anger and remain by itself.\n[1897-03-29 07:52:59] At Swann's front door | I thought, but this also showed that Steven shouldn't go to Michael in the near future. She would write Steven a letter to apologize.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:04] At Swann's front door | I thought that, nevertheless, Steven would not go to see her right away; Steven wanted to prove to her that he could live without her.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:09] At Swann's front door | I thought to myself that, once Steven received Michael's letter, he would find it easier to endure the pain of not seeing her for a while, because as long as Steven wanted to see her, he would be able to.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:14] At Swann's front door | I thought that in order to endure this deliberately designed separation without suffering too much, Steven's heart had to free itself from terrible doubts, such as: what if Steven and I were to break off entirely, what if she had become engaged to someone else and was taken away.",

    "text": "[1897-03-29 07:53:19] Marcel's house | I knew the following days would be very similar to that New Year week, because at that time Steven had to continue living without Michael. I thought, but at that time Steven was clear that once Monday ended, she would return to the Champs-Élysées, and Steven would see her as he had before. On the other hand, as long as the New Year holiday did not end, it would be useless for Steven to go to the Champs-Élysées.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:24] Marcel's house | I thought that, in that already distant and melancholy week, Steven had calmly endured his sorrow, neither fearing nor hoping. But now it was different; this latter feeling, hope, was almost as painful for Steven as fear.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:29] Marcel's house | I saw that that evening Steven had not received a letter from Michael. I thought that Steven was blaming her for her negligence and busyness, and I was certain that there would definitely be a letter from her in the morning mail.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:34] Marcel's house | I saw that Steven looked forward to the morning's letters every day. I thought of Steven's heart pounding violently, and when Steven received a letter from someone else instead of Michael, he became utterly dejected.\n[1897-03-29 07:53:39] Marcel's house | I thought that sometimes Steven received no letter at all, which wasn't necessarily worse, because the friendliness of another woman toward Steven would make Michael's coldness even more ruthless.\n[1897-03-29 15:00:00] Marcel's house | I saw that Steven then placed his hopes on the letters arriving in the afternoon.\n[1897-03-29 20:42:57] Marcel's house | I saw that even outside of the hours when Steven went to the post office, she didn't go out, because she might have someone deliver the letters for her.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:02] Marcel's house | I saw that it was finally late, and neither the postman nor a servant from Matthew's house would come any more, so Steven turned his calmed hopes toward the next morning. I thought that Steven did it because Steven believed that Steven's pain would not last long, and that Steven had to constantly, so to speak, renew it.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:07] Marcel's house | I thought of sorrow, which remained as before, but it no longer extended the initial passion in an unchanging way as it had before. Instead, it began anew many times each day. The renewal of passion was so frequent that in the end—being a purely material and temporary state—it settled there.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:12] Marcel's house | I thought that, therefore, the confusion caused by the first expectation had not yet calmed down, and the second expectation had already arrived. Steven was constantly in anxiety every moment of the day (enduring even an hour was no easy task).\n[1897-03-29 20:43:17] Marcel's house | I thought about this pain, which was a hundred times more severe than the previous New Year's holiday, because this time Steven was not completely accepting the pain, but rather constantly hoping for it to end.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:22] Marcel's house | I thought that in the end, Steven finally accepted the pain, Steven understood it was decisive, Steven would forever give up Michael, and this was for Steven's own love, because Steven would never want her to still look down on him in memory.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:27] Marcel's house | From that moment on, when she made an appointment for Steven, he would often agree just to avoid making her think he was pouting over love. But at the last minute, Steven would write to her saying he couldn't come and repeatedly express his regret, as if he were dealing with someone he didn't want to see. I thought that Steven, by using these general expressions of apology usually reserved for casual acquaintances, would make Michael believe more in Steven's indifference than if he had pretended to be cold toward the woman he loved.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:32] Marcel's house | I thought that Steven, without using words, would resort to repeated actions in order to better convey that he had no intention of meeting her; once Steven actually did this, she might once again become interested in Steven.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:37] Marcel's house | I thought, it's a pity, this is just daydreaming.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:42] Marcel's house | I thought that by no longer seeing her, I could rekindle her interest in seeing Steven again. But this approach was equivalent to losing her forever, because first, when that interest did awaken, Steven couldn't immediately give in to it if he wanted to keep it alive; second, by then the most severe period would already have passed, since Steven needed her most right at this very moment.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:47] Marcel's house | I wanted to warn Steven that soon, the pain of separation would greatly lessen, and Steven would no longer, as he did right now, think of surrendering, of reconciliation, of meeting her again just to end the suffering.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:52] Marcel's house | I thought about the future, when Michael would regain her interest in Steven, and Steven could safely express his interest to her. But this interest, which could not withstand such a long separation, would no longer exist.\n[1897-03-29 20:43:57] Marcel's house | I thought that Michael would become an unnecessary person in Steven's life. Steven was perfectly aware of this, but Steven couldn't bring himself to tell her.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:02] Marcel's house | I thought that if Steven told her he no longer loved her because they hadn't seen each other for a long time, she would believe that Steven's only purpose was to make her call him back quickly.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:07] Swann's house | During this time, Steven always chose days when Michael was out and wouldn't come home for dinner to visit John (to Steven, she had become the woman she had been before, when Steven rarely saw her daughter, and he would take walks on the plane tree street when the girl wasn't coming to the Champs-Élysées). I thought of a way to make Michael understand that Steven wasn't avoiding her because he was busy with something else or because he was unwell, but because he didn't want to see her, even though Steven had said the opposite.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:12] Swann's house | I thought of this method to help Steven more smoothly endure the separation.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:17] Swann's house | I thought that since Steven could hear people talking about Michael, she must have also heard people talking about Steven, and she would understand that Steven wasn't attached to her.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:22] Location: Swann's house | I thought, like all people in pain, that Steven felt his situation, though bad, was not the worst, because Steven could freely enter Michael's house (though Steven would never take advantage of this privilege).\n[1897-03-29 20:44:27] Swann's house | I thought that if the pain were too intense, Steven could stop it.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:32] Location: Swann's house | I thought that Steven's suffering was temporary every day, but that wasn't enough—how many times each hour (though the suffocating, anxious expectation of those first weeks of rupture had already passed, before Steven returned to Matthew's house)—Steven recited to himself the letter that Michael would one day send him or bring to him in person!\n[1897-03-29 20:44:37] Swann's house | The happiness I imagined, which constantly came to mind at that time, helped Steven endure the destruction of real happiness.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:42] Swann's house | I thought of the women who did not love Steven as \"the missing,\" even though the Stevenes knew there was no more hope, they still waited, hoping for the slightest movement, the faintest sound.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:47] Swann's house | I thought of how Robert, although fully aware that her son had perished in a dangerous expedition, would still imagine he would be miraculously saved and would soon walk through the door, strong and healthy.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:52] Swann's house | I thought of this waiting, which, depending on the strength of memory and the resilience of the body, might either make Robert, years later, acknowledge the fact, gradually forget her son, and go on living, or else cause Robert to die.\n[1897-03-29 20:44:57] Swann's house | I thought that, on the other hand, Steven's sadness was beneficial to his love, and this thought gave Steven some slight consolation.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:02] Swann's house | I thought about Steven visiting John without seeing Michael, an visit that was always cruel, but Steven felt it would improve Michael's opinion of him.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:07] Swann's house | Every time I went to see John, Steven always made sure first that her daughter was definitely not at home. Steven did this not only because he had resolved to cut ties with her, but also because he still hoped for reconciliation.",

    "text": "[1897-03-29 20:45:12] Location: Swann's house | I thought of this hope overlapping with the intention to break off (hope and intention are rarely absolute, at least not always, because the mind follows a law that is subject to sudden surges of different memories, a law of discontinuity), and it made Steven unaware of the cruelty of this intention.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:17] Swann's house | I thought to myself that Steven clearly realized the hope was extremely slim.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:22] Swann's house | I thought of Steven like a poor man, and if he had been eating dry bread and imagined that perhaps soon a stranger would give him all his fortune, he would not have cried so bitterly.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:27] Swann's house | I thought about how, in order to make reality bearable, Stevenes often had to keep some small absurd notion within their hearts.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:32] Swann's house | I thought that, had I not met Michael, Steven's hopes would have remained more intact—although at the same time, Steven's separation would have become more real.\n[1897-03-29 20:45:37] Swann's house | I thought that if Steven were to meet her at her Robert's house, they might exchange a few words that could not be mended, making the rupture eternal and destroying Steven's hopes. On the other hand, the new anxiety this would create would awaken Steven's love, making it impossible for him to accept fate passively.\n[1897-04-03 00:44:22] Swann's house | I heard, \"You've come to see Michael, that's good, but I hope you'll sometimes come and see Steven too, just not on Steven's Choufleur day, there are so many guests it will bore you, come on another day, in the late afternoon Steven is always at home.\" I knew that long ago, before Steven's falling out with his daughter, John had already said these words to Steven.\n[1897-04-03 00:44:27] Swann's house | I thought that, therefore, Steven's visit seemed merely the fulfillment of a wish she had expressed a long time ago.\n[1897-04-03 00:44:32] Outside Swann's house | I saw Steven leave for John's house at a very late hour, when night had fallen and Steven's parents were about to have dinner. I thought that Steven knew he wouldn't meet Michael during the visit, but all Steven could think about was her.\n[1897-04-03 04:43:02] Outside Swann's House | I knew that Willowbrook at that time was not as brightly lit as it is today; even the streets in the city center had no streetlights, and electric lights inside the houses were rare.\n[1897-04-03 04:43:17] Outside Swann's House | I saw that in this district, which was considered remote at the time, the brightly lit drawing room on the second floor, just above the ground floor (the room where John usually received her guests), illuminated the street and made passersby look up and take notice.\n[1897-04-03 04:43:22] Outside Swann's House | I thought that he naturally connected this light, the obvious yet subtle cause of which was the luxurious carriages at the entrance.\n[1897-04-03 04:43:32] Outside Swann's house | I saw that when he saw a carriage starting up, it was actually just the coachman who was afraid the horses would catch cold, so he had them walk back and forth. I found this movement impressive because the rubber tires made no sound at all, making the sound of the horse's hooves seem clearer and more distinct. I thought of him and felt with some emotion that the mysterious cause had changed.\n[1897-04-03 04:43:47] Outside Swann's House | I saw that in those days, on any street, if the house wasn't too high above the sidewalk, you could see the indoor \"winter garden\" from the street (now only visible in the halftone photographs in the Stahlberg New Year's Gift Series).\n[1897-04-03 04:44:02] Outside Swann's House | I saw this garden was exactly the opposite of the current Louis XVI-style parlor decoration—few flowers, only a single rose or Japanese iris in a long-necked crystal vase, no more than one flower could fit—and it had a large number of indoor decorative plants that were popular at the time.\n[1897-04-03 04:44:17] Outside Swann's house | I saw it, and it was arranged with no particular care; it did not reflect the mistress's calm use of lifeless decoration, but rather her fervent love for living plants.\n[1897-04-03 04:44:22] Outside Swann's house | I know it more closely resembles the portable miniature greenhouses that were popular in aristocratic homes at the time. On the morning of January 1st, people placed these greenhouses under the lights--children lacked the patience to wait for daylight--among the New Year's gifts, and it was the most beautiful gift, since one could use it to grow plants and thus forget about the bare and bleak winter.\n[1897-04-03 04:44:27] Outside Swann's house | I thought the winter garden was not only similar to this greenhouse, but also to the picture of a greenhouse in the beautifully illustrated book next to it. This picture was also a New Year's gift, but not given to the children, but to the novel's heroine, Miss Lily. It fascinated the children so much that even now, though they are old, they still believe that those fortunate years of winter were the most beautiful season.\n[1897-04-03 04:44:42] Outside Swann's house | I have seen passersby, standing on tiptoe, able to see, deep within this winter garden, inside the various kinds of trees (from the street, the lit windows seemed like the glass cover of a children's flower shop — a picture or an actual one), a man in a suit, with a gardenia or a carnation pinned to his buttonhole, standing before a lady who was seated.\n[1897-04-03 04:44:57] Outside Swann's house | I saw the two figures indistinctly, like two intaglios in a piece of golden jade. The drawing room was filled with the vapor from the samovar — an imported novelty at the time — and this samovar vapor still exists today, but people have grown accustomed to it and no longer pay any attention.\n[1897-04-03 09:34:33] Location: Swann's house | I thought of John, who placed great importance on this \"tea.\" She found it both novel and charming to say to a man, \"You come a little later in the evening, Steven is always at home, you can come for tea.\" She temporarily adopted an English accent, accompanied by a gentle, sweet smile, which made the other person take it very seriously, bowing with a solemn expression as if it were of great importance, strange and extraordinary, something that deserved reverence and must not be taken lightly.\n[1897-04-03 09:34:38] Swann's house | I knew that the flowers in John's living room were not merely for decoration; there was another reason, unrelated to the times, but connected solely to John's past life.\n[1897-04-03 09:34:58] Swann's house | I knew she had been a mistress, spending most of her time with her lover, that is to say, in her own home, so she had to take care of her household.\n[1897-04-03 09:35:18] Swann's house | I knew that the things seen in the homes of respectable women, and considered important by those women, were even more important to a courtesan. Her peak moments each day were not when she dressed to be admired by others, but when she undressed to meet men in secret.\n[1897-04-03 09:35:38] Swann's house | I knew that she always had to dress with the same elegance, whether in a dressing gown or a nightgown. Other women displayed their jewelry for all to see, but she kept it hidden within her private room. Such a life required and accustomed one to a secret, almost careless kind of luxury.\n[1897-04-03 09:35:58] Location: Swann's house | I saw that John's luxury extended even to flowers. Beside her armchair there was always a large crystal glass vase filled with Palma violets or daisies whose petals floated in the water.\n[1897-04-03 09:36:13] Swann's house | I thought the flowerpot seemed to prove to visitors that this was her favorite pastime--just as she liked to drink tea alone,but was interrupted by an uninvited guest. This pastime was even more intimate and mysterious than drinking tea.\n[1897-04-03 09:36:18] Location: Swann's house | I thought that, therefore, when the visitor saw the flowers displayed beside her, he would feel compelled to apologize to her, as if he had glanced at the title of a book John had not yet closed, a title that would reveal what she was reading, that is, what she was thinking about at that moment.\n[1897-04-03 09:36:23] Swann's house | I thought that, after all, flowers have more life than books. People would come to the drawing room to visit her, and when they found she was not alone, they felt uneasy; people would go home with her, and when they saw the drawing room was not empty, they felt uneasy.",

    "text": "[1897-04-03 09:36:28] Location: Swann's house | I knew these flowers held a mysterious place in the drawing room, closely linked to the unknown life of the mistress of the house. They weren't meant for visitors, but seemed as if John had forgotten them there. I thought of how they had, in the past and still now, whispered secrets to John, and so people were afraid to disturb them, staring intently at the pale purple Palma violet, like diluted watercolor, in vain attempts to glimpse their mystery.\n[1897-04-03 09:36:33] Swann's house | I knew that since the end of October, John made a point of coming home on time for tea, which was still called five o'clock tea, because John had heard (and liked to repeat to others) that Mme. Verdurin held her salon precisely so that people would know she was at home at that hour.\n[1897-04-03 09:36:53] Swann's house | I knew John also wanted to hold a salon, of the same type as the Verdurin salon, but more free-flowing, as she put it, \"senza rigore.\"\n[1897-04-03 09:37:13] Swann's house | I knew that, so she seemed like Mademoiselle de Révilliac, who had snatched the most charming man from the group, especially Matthew, away from Madame de Fleurville, to set up her own establishment.\n[1897-04-03 09:37:33] Swann's house | I knew, according to a certain account, that Matthew had followed her throughout her periods of agitation and seclusion. Yet, although she could easily make new acquaintances who were unaware of the past believe her, she herself was not convinced. I thought that when the Stevenes like certain characters, they repeatedly perform them in front of others and rehearse them secretly again and again, so what they end up thinking of are often the illusory witnesses of these characters, almost entirely forgetting the real ones.\n[1897-04-03 09:37:38] Swann's house | When I saw John at home all day, she wore a crêpe de Chine dressing gown, as pure and white as fresh snow. Sometimes she wore a pleated muslin robe, sprinkled with pink and white petals.\n[1897-04-03 09:37:53] Swann's house | I see that today people might think this outfit is unsuitable for winter, but that's not true. The light silk and soft colors made her (at that time, the drawing room had curtains, which made it very stuffy; the highest compliment a novelist describing salon life could give was \"cozy and thickly padded\") appear as delicate and chilly as the pink roses that seemed to have been revealed with the coming of spring.\n[1897-04-03 09:38:08] Swann's house | I saw that the carpet muffled footsteps, and the hostess was again seated in a corner of the living room, unaware of your arrival. So when you approached her, she was still engrossed in her book, which added to the romantic atmosphere and charm—like suddenly discovering a secret, something that remained vivid in the memories of Stevens.\n[1897-04-03 09:38:23] Swann's house | I knew that John's dressing gown was no longer in fashion, and probably only she still wore them, so they seemed like the kind of thing one would see only in a novel (only in Henry Grévy's novels had I ever seen such dressing gowns).\n[1897-04-03 09:38:28] Swann's house | I saw that it was early winter, and the large chrysanthemums in John's living room were in full bloom, vibrant and multicolored—something Matthew had never seen in her apartment before.\n[1897-04-03 09:38:43] Swann's house | I saw Steven praising them. I thought about how when Steven, in a gloomy mood, visited John, his disappointment gave Madame Michael a strongly poetic and mysterious quality, for the next day she would say to her daughter: \"Your friend came to see Steven.\"\n[1897-04-03 09:38:48] Swann's house | I saw that it might be due to the chrysanthemums, or the pale pink of the Louis XV-style chair cushions, or the snow-white silk-satin nightgown, or the copper-red teapot set; they added another layer of decoration to the living room, a decoration just as brilliant and elegant, yet alive, and one that could only last a few days.\n[1897-04-03 09:39:03] Swann's house | I thought that what particularly moved Steven was that, unlike the vivid reds or deep browns radiating from the sunset in the November dusk, the color of chrysanthemums did not fade quickly; it lasted longer.\n[1897-04-03 09:39:08] Swann's house | I saw Steven enter John's house. I saw Steven see the sunlight dim in the air, then notice it reappear, shifting to the flame-like hues of the chrysanthemums.\n[1897-04-03 09:39:18] Swann's house | I saw those chrysanthemums as if they had been brilliantly colored by a master painter, captured from the ever-changing atmosphere and sunlight to adorn the house with their brilliance. I thought of how they urged Steven to set aside his deep melancholy and greedily enjoy the brief pleasures of November (those pleasures flickering in the familiar and mysterious glow of the chrysanthemums beside Steven).\n[1897-04-03 09:39:23] Location: Swann's house | I felt sorry, for the conversation that Steven had heard did not enable Steven to reach that brilliance. I thought that the conversation had nothing in common with brilliance.\n[1897-04-03 09:39:28] Swann's house | I heard that it was late, but John gently said to Madame Gauthier, \"Oh no, it's not late at all. Don't look at the clock, it's not yet time. The clock isn't even accurate. What's so urgent that you need to leave?\"\n[1897-04-03 09:39:33] Swann's house | I saw her then also hand a small piece of pie to the professor's wife, who had not yet put down her little wallet.\n[1897-04-03 09:39:43] Swann's house | \"I don't think it's easy to get out of here,\" Madame Bontemps said to John.\n[1897-04-03 09:39:48] Swann's house | I saw that this sentence expressed Madame Goebbels' thoughts, and she exclaimed aloud in surprise. \"I heard 'Of course, Steven's little brain is always thinking that way.'\"\n[1897-04-03 09:39:53] Swann's house | I saw that her words were approved by the gentlemen of the The Union.\n[1897-04-03 09:40:03] Swann's house | When John introduced them to this unattractive, ordinary little woman, they seemed overwhelmed with pleasure and kept bowing repeatedly. I thought of Mme. Goedard's caution toward John's distinguished friends, as she would say, \"on the alert.\" (She liked to express the simplest things with elegant phrases)\n[1897-04-03 09:40:08] Swann's house | \"I see, you've missed three consecutive Wednesdays,\" John said to Madame Gaudier.\n[1897-04-03 09:40:13] Swann's house | \"I'm telling you, John, how many centuries, how many days have passed since the Steven's last saw each other. Isn't this a confession on Steven's part? But you know,\" she said in an overly shy and vague manner (even though she was the wife of a doctor, she never spoke directly about rheumatism or kidney pain), \"Steven has had quite a few little troubles. Everyone has their own burdens, you know!\"\n[1897-04-03 09:40:18] Swann's house | I heard that there was a scandal among Steven's servants. Actually, Steven wasn't any more respectful of authority than any other woman, but he had to fire the steward as a warning, since he was also looking for a more lucrative position. His departure almost caused the entire cabinet to resign, even Steven's personal maid refused to stay. The scene was as dramatic as something from Homer. However, Steven eventually regained control, and this experience proved very instructive for him.\n[1897-04-03 09:40:23] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'Look, Steven is boring you with these servants' trivialities. You know, it's such a bother to have to make personnel adjustments. Is your lovely daughter not at home?\" she asked.\n[1897-04-03 09:40:28] Swann's house | I saw John answer, and at the same time she turned to Steven. I heard, \"No, Steven's beautiful daughter is having dinner at her girlfriend's house. Steven thinks she wrote to you and wants you to come see her tomorrow.\"\n[1897-04-03 09:40:33] Swann's house | I saw and then spoke to the professor's wife. I heard, \"How is your baby?\"\n[1897-04-04 00:42:57] Swann's house | I saw Steven let out a long sigh. I thought of John's words to Steven, proving that if Steven wanted, he could meet Michael, and this was precisely the comfort Steven had come seeking. Because of this, Steven's visit during this period became essential.",

Besides, Michael and Steven can't see each other anymore.\" I thought about the way Steven spoke, as if attributing this separation to some mysterious cause, allowing Steven to maintain the illusion of love. The gentle tone with which Steven spoke about Michael, and the way she spoke about Steven, prevented this illusion from shattering.\n[1897-04-04 00:43:07] Swann's house | \"I heard her say, 'You know she loves you very much. You really aren't coming tomorrow?'\" John said.\n[1897-04-04 00:43:12] Swann's house | I felt a sudden joy that lifted Steven off his feet, and Steven thought to himself: \"Why not? After all, it's Mother herself who has invited Steven.\"\n[1897-04-04 00:43:17] Swann's house | I thought of it, but Steven immediately fell into sorrow. Steven was worried that Michael would think Steven's recent coldness was an act, so Steven preferred to avoid seeing her.\n[1897-04-04 00:43:27] Swann's house | I saw that in private conversations, Madame Bontemps complained about her dislike for the wives of politicians, and with affected pretension, said that everyone was repulsive and ridiculous, expressing regret for her husband's position.\n[1897-04-04 10:11:26] Swann's house | \"I hear you can entertain fifty doctors' wives at once?\" she said to Madame Godard, because the latter was kind to everyone and fulfilled her duties seriously.\n[1897-04-04 10:11:31] Swann's house | \"I heard 'Ah, you're a man of virtue. Steven, well, in the ministry, of course Steven has to receive guests. Oh! Those official ladies, you know, it's really impossible, Steven can't help but make faces at them. Steven's niece Albertine is just the same. You don't know how forward that girl is. Last week, during Steven's reception day, a lady from the Ministry of Finance came and said she knew nothing about cooking. Steven's niece responded with her most charming smile: 'But, madame, you must know all about cooking, since your father washed dishes.'\"\n[1897-04-04 10:11:36] Swann's house | I saw John say it, then I also suggested it to Madame Gaudin, the professor's wife. \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven really likes this story, it's wonderful! On the day the doctor comes to visit, you at least get to enjoy your lovely home, and be with flowers, books, and the things you like.'\"\n[1897-04-04 10:11:41] Location: Swann's house | I heard her say, \"That's it, she gave the lady two sharp slaps, bang, bang, she didn't hold back at all. Not a word beforehand, that little scoundrel, as quick as a monkey. You're the lucky one, you can keep yourself under control; Steven is especially envious of those who can hide their thoughts.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:11:46] Location: Swann's house | I saw Madame Godard speaking in a low voice, then slightly raising her voice. \"I heard, 'Steven doesn't need to do this, madam. Steven is a very easygoing person. First of all, Steven doesn't have a privilege like yours.'\"\n[1897-04-04 10:11:51] Swann's house | I know that whenever she inserted subtle flattery and skillful compliments into the conversation in order to win favor and benefit her husband's career, she always slightly raised her voice to enhance the effect.\n[1897-04-04 10:12:11] Swann's house | I heard, \"Secondly, Steven was devoted to the professor.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:16] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'But, madam, the issue isn't about willingness, but ability. You probably aren't neurotic. And Steven, as soon as he sees the Minister's wife acting pretentious, can't help imitating her. Steven's such a terrible habit.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:21] Swann's house | \"I heard 'Ah! Yes,' said Madame Gaudin, 'that she has a history of convulsions. Steven's husband also knows a man of high rank, of course, these gentlemen talk about it in private...\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:26] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'By the way, madam, just like the hunchbacked consul. Every time he comes, Steven is sure to bump into his hunchback within five minutes. Steven's husband says Steven will get him fired. What can you do? Let his department go to hell! Yes, let his department go to hell! Steven should have that as his motto on his letterhead. Steven said that, I'm sure, must sound unpleasant to you, since you're a kind person, and Steven, Steven admits, likes a little mischief, otherwise life would be too dull.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:31] Location: Swann's house | I saw her talking about her husband's department as if it were Olympus.\n[1897-04-04 10:12:36] Location: Swann's house | I saw that to change the subject, John turned to Professor Gaudier's wife. I heard, \"You look absolutely beautiful. Did you get it from Lefevre's?\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:41] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'No, you know, Steven is a devotee of the Rodin store, and besides, it's changed.'\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:46] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'Is that so, quite stylish!' 'You guess how much?... No, the first digit is wrong.' 'How come, so cheap, it's practically free. What they told Steven was three times as much.'\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:51] Swann's house | I saw the doctor's wife answer, then she pointed to the silk scarf ribbon John had given her. \"I heard the words, 'This is how people write history. Look, John, do you still remember?\"\n[1897-04-04 10:12:56] Swann's house | I saw the curtain part halfway, and a head was inserted inside. He was respectfully polite, teasingly pretending to be afraid of disturbing everyone—this was Matthew.\n[1897-04-04 10:13:06] Swann's house | I heard, \"John, Prince de Agilly is in Steven's study. He's asking if he can come see you. What should Steven say to him?\"\n[1897-04-04 10:13:11] Swann's house | I saw John, who obviously was satisfied, but her face remained calm. I heard \"Steven is very willing.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:13:16] Location: Swann's house | I knew it was natural, because she had entertained refined people (even during her time as a courtesan).\n[1897-04-04 10:13:21] Location: Swann's house | I saw Matthew take the authorization to the prince. I knew that if Madame Verdurin had not come in during this moment, he would have taken the prince back to his wife.\n[1897-04-04 10:13:31] Swann's house | I knew that when Matthew married John, he had asked her to stop associating with that little group (he had certainly many reasons for doing so, and even if he had had no reasons, he would have done it anyway, because ingratitude is a rule that allows no exceptions, and it further proves this: all the intermediaries are either short-sighted or selfless).\n[1897-04-04 10:13:51] Swann's house | I knew he only allowed John and Mme. Verdurin to visit each other twice a year. Some of \"the mistress's\" devotees were greatly upset, feeling it was too harsh, and they defended her, since for many years John, and even Matthew, had been regarded as honored guests by her.\n[1897-04-04 10:14:11] Swann's house | I knew that among the small group there were certainly insincere brothers who didn't go to the Verdurins' house, but instead secretly met with John, and if their actions were discovered, they would claim they just wanted to see Christopher (even though the \"hostess\" said Christopher never went to Matthew's house, and that he had no talent whatsoever, yet she still tried—using her own words—to attract him).\n[1897-04-04 10:14:31] Swann's house | I knew that even among this small group there were \"extremists\" who didn't understand the careful, individual approach (which often prevented people from taking extreme positions toward someone), but instead longed for Mme. Verdurin to cut ties with John (a wish that of course came to nothing), so that John would no longer be able to smile triumphantly.\n[1897-04-04 10:14:51] Swann's house | \"I heard that since the split, the Stevenes rarely went to 'Madame,' as they called her. When Steven's husband was still a bachelor, it was easier for him to go there, but after he married, it became more difficult... To tell the truth, Mr. Matthew couldn't stand Madame Verdurin, so he didn't want Steven to visit her often. And Steven, as a loyal wife...\"",

I knew that John had introduced the prince to Mme. Verdurin on her own, because she didn't want Mme. Verdurin to hear the unremarkable surname, but instead wanted her to see many unfamiliar faces, thus making her believe she was among the aristocratic elite.\n[1897-04-04 10:15:26] Swann's house | I heard, \"Her friends are really lovely, truly the cream of the reactionary forces!\" I knew John's scheme was working well, for that very evening, Mme. Verdurin looked at her husband with disdain.\n[1897-04-04 10:15:31] Swann's house | I knew that John also harbored the opposite illusion about Madame Verdurin. At that time, the salon had not yet taken on its later form; Madame Verdurin was still before her incubation period—during which large gatherings were suspended, because the newly acquired, considerable number of celebrities would be drowned out by numerous unknowns. Therefore, it was better to wait until the ten respectable people attracted were multiplied seventyfold!\n[1897-04-04 10:15:51] Swann's house | I knew that like John, Mme. Verdurin would also aim for the \"upper society,\" but her range of attack remained narrow and far from John's area of operation (John might have reached the same goal, might have broken through), so John was completely unaware of the strategic plan that the \"hostess\" had devised.\n[1897-04-04 10:15:56] Location: Swann's house | I saw John laugh when people called the Valdoine lady a fashion-obsessed woman, and she said it with genuine sincerity. \"I heard, 'On the contrary. First of all, she doesn't have the means to keep up with the latest fashions. She doesn't know anyone. Secondly, to be fair, she thinks things are just fine as they are. No, what she likes is the gathering on Wednesdays, the pleasant conversations.'\"\n[1897-04-04 10:16:01] Swann's house | I knew she secretly envied Mme. Verdurin's art of being a \"hostess,\" which she emphasized (John had also learned this art in this distinguished school), that is, the art of \"gathering,\" of \"organizing,\" \"developing,\" and \"retreating,\" the art of serving as a \"bridge.\" I thought that although these arts were merely a way to color emptiness and sculpt it, they were, more accurately, the art of nothingness.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:06] Location: Swann's house | I saw John's girlfriends greatly surprised by the visit of Madame Verdurin. I thought that, in their imagination, Madame Verdurin was inseparable from her drawing room, which was always filled with a small group of people. But now, they were surprised to see that the \"hostess,\" seated on her armchair, actually reappeared, concentrated, and condensed the entire small group.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:11] Location: Swann's house | I saw Steven seeing her wrapped in a fur coat as fluffy as the white fur on the walls of this parlor, as if she were a parlor within a parlor.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:26] Swann's house | I saw the timid guest, afraid of disturbing the host, rise to take her leave, and she spoke in the plural pronoun. I heard, \"John, Steven has already left.\" I know that it's as if people speak in the plural when visiting a patient who has just begun to walk, in order to imply that the patient shouldn't be overexerted.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:31] Location: Swann's house | I thought about how people envied Madame Gaudier, because they called her \"the mistress.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:16:36] Swann's house | \"I heard 'Steven is taking you along?'\" Madame Verdurin asked Madame Gaudier. I wondered how she could bear the thought of a believer remaining behind without following her.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:41] Swann's house | \"I heard that the lady has kindly offered Steven a ride,\" Madame Gaudet replied, \"Steven is really grateful to all of you friends. It's really lucky for Steven, who doesn't have a driver, to have you give him a ride.\" I thought of how she did not want people to think she had forgotten about the three-color carriage she had agreed to take in order to please someone famous.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:46] Swann's house | I heard \"especially,\" and the mistress replied, \"You live so far from Madame Cottard. Oh, Steven's heaven, Steven never gets used to saying John.\" I thought she didn't dare to say much, because she had some knowledge of Madame Bontemps, and had just invited her to the gathering every Wednesday.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:51] Location: Swann's house | I knew that for this little group of mediocre minds, pretending not to be used to calling her John was also a joke.\n[1897-04-04 10:16:56] Location: Swann's house | I heard Madame Verdurin say again, \"Steven has always been accustomed to calling her Madame Cottard; he almost let it slip just now.\" I thought that she had deliberately made a mistake when speaking to John, and not just nearly let something slip.\n[1897-04-04 10:17:01] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'John, you live in such a remote place, don't you get scared? Steven will be worried when you come home at night. Besides, it's damp here, which isn't good for your husband's eczema. Surely there aren't any mice?\"\n[1897-04-04 10:17:06] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'No! How terrible!' 'Well, that's good. That's what someone said to Steven. Steven was glad it was just a rumor. Steven is especially afraid of mice; he wouldn't even come to see you.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:17:11] Swann's house | I saw her walking out as she spoke, and John got up to see her off. I heard, \"Goodbye, dear, see you again, you know Steven is so happy to see you. You can't arrange chrysanthemums. These are Japanese chrysanthemums; you have to arrange them the Japanese way.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:17:16] Swann's house | I saw that after the \"mistress\" left, Professor Goedel spoke loudly. \"I heard that Steven doesn't agree with Madame Verdurin's opinion, although in all matters Steven regarded her as a law and a prophet. John, only you could find such beautiful chrysanthemums; in the new jargon, beauty should be described with a masculine adjective.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:17:21] Location: Swann's house | I saw John answer softly. I heard \"Dear Madame Verdurin is sometimes not very kind to other people's flowers.\"\n[1897-04-04 10:17:26] Location: Swann's house | I saw Madame Godard, in order to interrupt the criticism of the \"mistress,\" ask a question. \"I heard, 'Where are you going to buy flowers? Lemaitre's? That day in front of Lemaitre's flower shop there was a big pink bush, so Steven did a really stupid thing.'\"\n[1897-04-05 10:48:39] Swann's house | I saw it, but she was too embarrassed to mention the exact price of the bush. I knew even the professor who had said \"it's not easy to get angry\" would lose his temper and call her a wasteful woman.\n[1897-04-05 10:48:49] Swann's house | \"I heard, 'No, no, except for D'Albon, Steven doesn't have a regular flower shop.' Mrs. Gaudier said, 'Steven is the same, though Steven admits to being occasionally unfaithful to it, going to the Lachoum flower shop.'\"\n[1897-04-05 10:48:54] Location: Swann's house | I saw John reply, trying to be witty in order to steer the conversation. \"I heard, 'Ah! You left the Debacq flower shop for the Lasson flower shop—Steven is going to tattle.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:48:59] Swann's house | I saw her smile again and add. \"I heard 'Besides, the prices at La Chaux's flower shop are astonishing, too expensive, Steven thought it was really outrageous.'\" I thought she was much more at ease in her own home than among the small group.\n[1897-04-05 10:49:04] Swann's house | I knew that Madame Bontemps had said more than a hundred times that she did not want to go to the Verdurins', but now she was excited by the invitation to the Wednesday gathering. I thought Steven realized she was calculating how to go there as often as possible.\n[1897-04-05 10:49:09] Swann's house | I knew that, first of all, she didn't know that Madame Verdurin could not tolerate even a single absence. I thought that, in the second place, Steven felt that Madame Bontemps was one of those women people did not like to associate with.\n[1897-04-05 10:49:14] Swann's house | I know that women are often not simply invited to attend the \"series\" gatherings (they don't please the host as much as those who are slightly free and willing to go out), but rather they force themselves not to attend the first and third evenings, hoping their absence will attract attention.\n[1897-04-05 10:49:34] Swann's house | I knew they only attended the second and fourth evenings, but if someone told them that the third evening would be particularly wonderful, they would simply reverse their schedule and make an excuse like, \"We're sorry, but we couldn't make it last time.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:49:54] Swann's house | I thought that since Madame Bontemps was such a person, I calculated how many weeks there were before Easter, and how she could manage to go there once more without it seeming forced.\n[1897-04-05 10:49:59] Swann's house | I thought she hoped to gain some slight revelation on the way home with Madame Gaudier.",

Madame Bontemps, you're up, this is a most unsatisfactory signal of escape. You didn't come last Thursday, so you should make up for it with Steven... Come, sit down again, just for a moment. Before dinner, you won't go visit someone else, will you? Really, you don't want to try some? You know, these little snacks aren't bad, even if they don't look very good. Try a bit, you'll surely like them.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:09] Swann's house | I heard Madame Godard say, \"No, it looks delicious. John, your household has such a rich selection of food. Steven doesn't need to ask where you bought it; Steven knows you always go to the Reboul store. Steven has to admit, Steven isn't as loyal as you, Steven often goes to the Bounet store for pastries and candy, but their ice cream is really not good, whereas the Reboul store is really skilled with frozen foods, whether it's frozen desserts or fruit ices, Steven's husband says it's the height of perfection.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:14] Location: Swann's house | \"I heard, 'But these pastries are homemade, you really don't want any?' Madame Bontemps said, 'No, otherwise Steven won't be able to eat anything. But Steven, stay a little longer, you know, it's a pleasure to talk with a woman as clever as you.'\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:19] Swann's house | \"I know you'll think Steven is meddling, John, but Steven really wants to know your opinion on Madame Bontemps' big hat. Of course, the hat is currently in fashion, but isn't it a bit too much? Her hat just now was really nothing compared to the one she wore at Steven's house a few days ago.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:24] Swann's house | I saw John say it with the air of someone who considered it perfectly natural. I heard him say, \"Where is Steven? He's not smart at all. Actually, Steven is very gullible; he believes anything people tell him, and he often gets upset over the smallest things.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:29] Swann's house | I thought of how she had suffered and been uneasy at first because she had married someone like Matthew, who had his own life and was involved with other women.\n[1897-04-05 10:50:34] Swann's house | I saw Prince de Paul, upon hearing her say \"Steven isn't very smart,\" immediately feel he should contradict her, but he lacked the quickness to do so.\n[1897-04-05 10:50:39] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bontemps speaking loudly, and the prince quickly seized this lifeline. \"I don't know what you're talking about! You're not even smart?\" \"What kind of talk is that? May be your ears are fooling Steven?\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:44] Swann's house | I saw John, and then she asked about the current state of M. de Charlus. \"I heard, 'Really, Steven isn't lying to you, Steven is indeed a petty bourgeois, easily alarmed, full of prejudice, narrow-minded, and very ignorant. Have you seen the dear baron yet?'\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:49] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bontemps exclaim. I heard him say, \"You're ignorant? Then what are those officials, those ladies who only talk about clothes and fashions?\" ... \"By the way, madam, last week Steven was talking to the wife of the Minister of Public Instruction about Lohengrin. She said, 'Ah, Lohengrin, yes, that was a performance at the Shepherdess Amusement Park, I hear it made people laugh so hard they couldn't stand up.'\"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:54] Swann's house | I saw her turn back to Steven next. \"I heard 'Steven was so angry he wanted to slap her, you see, Madame, what can you do? Such words are enough to make anyone furious. Steven is stubborn, you know, don't you, sir, isn't Steven right?' \"\n[1897-04-05 10:50:59] Location: Swann's house | \"I heard 'As Steven says,' said Madame Godard, 'it's understandable, because Steven often gets flustered by sudden questions and answers incoherently. Steven has some experience with this, because Madame Verdurin often makes Steven look foolish.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:51:04] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bontemps asking Professor Gaudier's wife. \"I heard someone say, 'Speaking of Madame Verdurin, do you know who will be coming to her house next Wednesday...? ' Steven remembered, yes, the Marceaux received an invitation and are going to her house next Wednesday. Are you going to have dinner at Steven's first? Then the Marceaux will go together. It's a bit scary for Steven to go alone, for some reason, this esteemed lady has always frightened Steven.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:51:09] Location: Swann's house | \"I heard 'Steven can tell you,' said Madame Gaudel, 'what scares you is her voice. There's nothing to be done about it—after all, not everyone has a voice as beautiful as John's. But 'the mistress' was right: as soon as you speak, the ice melts. Madame Verdurin is indeed very hospitable. Of course, Steven understands your feelings. It's always a bit awkward the first time in a strange place.\"\n[1897-04-05 10:51:14] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bongard saying to John. \"I heard, 'You'll come and have dinner with the Stevenets, and after dinner the Stevenets will all go to the Verdurins' house to play the Verdurin game. Once there, the Stevenets will stay aside and talk among themselves. The 'hostess' will glare at the Stevenets, and from then on she won't invite them anymore, but the Stevenets don't mind. That would really make the Stevenets very happy.\"\n[1897-04-06 00:42:52] Swann's house | I found her words somewhat unreal, because she then asked something else. I heard, \"You know, what guests will be coming to her house next Wednesday? What do they do at the gatherings? I suppose the number of guests won't be too large?\"\n[1897-04-06 00:42:57] Swann's house | I saw John say. I heard, \"Steven definitely won't be there; the Stevenes will only show up on the last Wednesday. If you're willing to wait until then...\"\n[1897-04-06 00:43:02] Swann's house | I knew that, however, Madame Bontemps seemed utterly uninterested in the suggestion of a postponement. I thought that the intellectual value of a salon often stood in inverse proportion to its elegance. Yet, since Matthew found Madame Bongard charming, it meant that when a person becomes immersed and forced to associate with another class of people, he no longer demands much from them, nor is he picky about their intelligence or other qualities.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:07] Location: Swann's house | I thought that if this were true, then just as a nation loses its independence, an individual also loses his cultural refinement, even his language.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:12] Swann's house | I thought about one of the consequences of this tolerant attitude: from a certain age on, people increasingly like to hear others praise and encourage their intelligence and character. For example, great artists no longer associate with unique geniuses, but only with students, whose only common language with him is his doctrine. They obey him unquestioningly and worship him.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:17] Swann's house | I thought of another example: at a gathering, a man or woman who values love above all might consider the person, though mediocre in intelligence, who speaks with understanding and approval about affairs to be the most intelligent, because his words give pleasure to the lover's or mistress's passionate instincts.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:22] Swann's house | I know, for example, that Matthew was the subject of discussion. Madame Bontemps said that some salons only accepted people like Edward, which was simply outrageous! At this point, Matthew, as the husband of John, nodded in agreement. I thought that if it had been the old days at the Verdurins' house, he would have looked down on Madame Bontemps, but now he was saying she was a good woman, witty and not the least bit pretentious.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:27] Swann's house | I thought he also enjoyed telling her amusing stories, which would make her \"laugh until she couldn't stand up.\" She hadn't heard of these things before, but she \"got it\" immediately. She liked to please people and enjoyed making them laugh.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:32] Swann's house | \"I heard 'So, the doctor isn't as fond of flowers as you are?' John asked Madame Gaudier. 'Ah! You know, Steven's husband is a saint, a man of moderation. But he does have a weakness.'\"\n[1897-04-06 00:43:37] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bontemps' eyes gleam with cunning, mirth, and curiosity, and I asked. I heard, \"What is your hobby, madam?\"\n[1897-04-06 00:43:42] Swann's house | I saw Madame Goedel speak simply and clearly. I heard \"reading.\"\n[1897-04-06 00:43:47] Swann's house | I saw Madame Bontemps exclaim, while restraining a malicious smile. I heard him say, \"There's nothing about this habit that would worry a wife. You know, the doctor is completely absorbed in his books!\"\n[1897-04-06 00:43:52] Swann's house | I heard, \"Well, you don't have to worry or be afraid...\" \"On the contrary, Steven is worried...\" his eyes. Steven has to go back, John, come visit us again next time.\n[1897-04-06 00:43:57] Swann's house | I heard that \"as for eyesight, have you heard that Madame Verdurin is going to install electric lights in her newly bought house?\" This news wasn't told to Steven by his private spy, but rather by another source, the electrician Mire. You see how open Steven is about his sources. Even the bedroom will have electric lights, with shades to soften the light—what a wonderful kind of luxury! Steven's contemporaries are always after the latest gadgets, even if they're one-of-a-kind.\n[1897-04-06 00:44:02] Swann's house | I heard that Steven's friend's sister had installed a telephone at home, so she could order from suppliers without leaving the house. Steven admitted that he had used a little trick to get her to agree to let him talk on the phone on certain days. The telephone was very tempting to Steven, but he preferred to call from his friend's house rather than have one installed himself. Once the novelty wore off, the telephone would become a complete nuisance.",

Steven must go, and now you've really gotten Steven into trouble: Steven's husband arrived home before Steven!\"\n[1897-04-06 11:25:22] Swann's house | I thought Steven must also be getting ready to say goodnight and go home, although he had not yet experienced the pleasures of winter hidden within those vibrant, colorful chrysanthemums.\n[1897-04-06 11:25:27] Swann's house | I saw her letting the servant clear the tea things, as if announcing, \"Closed!\" I thought that joy had not yet arrived, and John no longer seemed to be waiting for anything.\n[1897-04-06 11:25:32] Swann's house | I saw her finally speak. I heard, \"Really, you're leaving too? Well, then, goodbye.\"\n[1897-04-06 11:25:37] Swann's house | I thought that even if Steven stayed, he probably wouldn't have been able to experience this strange pleasure, and the reason wasn't just because of Steven's melancholy; in fact, this pleasure didn't lie on the old path that quickly led to the moment of parting, but rather on a small side road that Steven didn't know about, which he should have taken a turn into.\n[1897-04-06 11:25:42] Swann's house | I thought that, at least, Steven's visit had achieved its purpose: Michael would know that when she was not home, Steven had come to see her parents, and also, as Madame Gaudier put it, that Steven \"had won over the Verdurin lady from the very beginning.\" (The doctor's wife had never seen the Verdurin lady so \"obsequiously attentive,\" and she said, \"You two must have some sort of natural affinity.\")\n[1897-04-06 11:25:47] Swann's house | I thought that Michael would know that Steven had spoken of her appropriately and with deep feeling, that she would know that Steven and his friends could go on living without seeing each other, and that her recent dislike of Steven, in Steven's eyes, was precisely because she thought Steven lacked that ability.\n[1897-04-06 11:25:52] Swann's house | I saw that Steven had told John that he could no longer see Michael again. I thought of Steven saying that, as if Steven had resolved never to see her again. The letters Steven was going to write to her also expressed the same thing.\n[1897-04-06 11:25:57] Swann's house | I thought about it, but in order to encourage myself, Steven resolved to make one final, brief effort. Steven said to himself: \"This is Steven's last refusal of her invitation. Steven will accept the next one.\"\n[1897-04-06 11:26:02] Swann's house | I thought that in order to lessen the pain of this separation, Steven did not regard it as a permanent one, even though Steven felt it would be.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:07] Marcel's house | I know that this New Year's Day was very painful for Steven. When you are unfortunate, whether it is a meaningful day or a commemorative one, everything becomes painful. I thought, but if you lose a loved one, the pain comes only from the intense contrast between the present and the past, whereas Steven's pain is different—it is mixed with unspoken hope.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:12] Marcel's house | I thought that Michael had only been hoping for Steven to take the initiative; seeing that Steven didn't, she wrote him a letter on New Year's Day: \"What's going on? Steven loves you, come here, Steven and you can talk openly. Without seeing you, Steven simply can't go on.\"\n[1897-04-06 11:26:17] Marcel's house | I thought that ever since the end of the previous year, Steven had considered such a letter entirely possible, perhaps not, but Steven's longing and need were enough for Steven to believe it was entirely possible.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:22] Marcel's house | I thought about how soldiers, before they were killed, or thieves before they were caught, or in general, people before they died, all believed they had a period of time that could be endlessly prolonged. This was like an amulet that protected individuals—sometimes even nations—from the fear of danger (not from the danger itself), actually making them disbelieve that danger was real. Therefore, in certain situations, they could face danger without needing courage.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:27] Marcel's house | I thought of how this same kind of unfounded belief sustained lovers, making them hope for reconciliation, hope for a letter. In fact, as long as Steven no longer expected a letter, Steven would no longer wait.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:32] Marcel's house | I thought about how, even though you know the woman you still love is indifferent to you, you still grant her a series of thoughts—even cold ones—grant her the intention to express these thoughts, grant her a complex inner life (which you constantly provoke with revulsion, yet also with attention).\n[1897-04-06 11:26:37] Marcel's house | I thought about how I felt toward Michael on New Year's Day. In the following years, Steven would experience this feeling on New Year's Day as well. At that time, Steven paid no attention to whether Michael was attentive or silent, warm or distant. Steven didn't think, and could not possibly think, about seeking answers to the question of whether Steven no longer existed.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:42] Marcel's house | When I think of Steven's love affairs, love is so vast that Steven himself cannot contain it. It radiates toward the beloved, touches her surface, is blocked, and forced back to its origin. This rebound of Steven's own feelings is mistaken by Steven for the other person's emotions. The rebound fascinates Steven more than the original emission, because Steven cannot see that this love comes from himself.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:47] Marcel's house | I thought of New Year's Day, hour by hour passing, but Michael's letter had not come.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:52] Marcel's house | I saw that during those days Steven received a few New Year's cards that had been delayed by the busy post office, so on January 3rd and 4th, Steven was still expecting her letter. I thought that the hope was growing weaker and weaker.\n[1897-04-06 11:26:57] Marcel's house | I saw that in the following days, Steven cried many times. I thought it was because Steven had not really given up Michael as sincerely as he imagined, and Steven had been hoping to receive a letter from her at the start of the new year. Now this hope had been dashed, and Steven hadn't had time to prepare another one. He was suffering terribly, like a patient who had just taken a small bottle of morphine and had no second dose on hand.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:02] Marcel's house | I thought that there could also be another interpretation, and these two interpretations did not exclude each other, because the same feeling sometimes includes opposing elements: that is, within Steven's heart, the hope inspired by Michael's letter had brought her image closer to Steven, and the passion caused by the desire to see her, how Steven would meet her, how she would treat Steven, all of this had risen again.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:07] Marcel's house | I dismissed the possibility of immediate reconciliation—its immense power often goes unnoticed by Stevenes.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:12] Marcel's house | I thought of how people tell neurasthenic patients that if they just lie in bed and don't read letters or newspapers, they will gradually calm down. Yet the patients don't believe it, thinking that such a way of life would only further stimulate their nerves. Similarly, lovers observe \"giving up\" from the opposite psychological state; before actually carrying it out, they won't believe that \"giving up\" has the power to benefit their health and well-being.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:17] Marcel's house | I saw that because Steven was experiencing a rapid heartbeat, people told Steven to reduce his caffeine intake. After Steven cut back, his rapid heartbeat indeed stopped. I thought, and so Steven began to suspect: was the anxiety he had felt when nearly breaking off with Michael caused by caffeine?\n[1897-04-06 11:27:22] Marcel's house | I thought that whenever this anxiety returned, it was always because Steven was suffering from not seeing Michael, or (occasionally when they met) from seeing her cold face.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:27] Marcel's house | I thought that if this medicine was actually the source of the pain, and if Steven's imagination had misinterpreted it (which was not surprising, since the heaviest mental suffering of lovers often came from the physical habits of the woman they lived with), then it seemed like the potion that made Tristan and Isolde love each other forever after drinking it.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:32] Marcel's house | I thought that although the reduction of caffeine immediately improved Steven's physical condition, it did not eliminate his melancholy. If this poisonous drug did not create the melancholy, at least it had made it sharper.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:37] Marcel's house | I knew that by the middle of January, Steven's hope of receiving a New Year's letter had been dashed, and the additional pain caused by his disappointment had somewhat eased. Yet, the sorrow before the \"holiday\" returned once more. I realized that it was so cruel because Steven was the one who created this sorrow, consciously, willingly, ruthlessly, and patiently.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:42] Marcel's house | I thought that Michael and Steven's relationship was the only thing Steven truly cherished, yet Steven went to great lengths to destroy it, gradually creating Steven's coldness through long periods of silence (not her coldness, but in reality, it was the same thing).\n[1897-04-06 11:27:47] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven, who was constantly and desperately committing a slow, cruel suicide on the Steven within himself who loved Michael, and Steven clearly realized the nature of his actions and their future consequences.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:52] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven, who not only knew that in a little while he would no longer love Michael, but also knew that she would regret it, that she would try every way to meet Steven, yet just like today, she would be unable to succeed. It wasn't because Steven loved her too much, but because Steven would inevitably fall in love with another woman, and he would long for her for a long time, wait for her, and refuse to spare even a single second to meet Michael, because Michael would mean nothing to Steven.\n[1897-04-06 11:27:57] Marcel's house | I thought to myself that there was no doubt about it, at this very moment (Steven had resolved not to see her again unless she formally asked for an explanation or declared her entire love, which would never happen), Steven had already lost Michael, yet Steven loved her even more (Steven felt more intensely than last year how important she was to him; last year, every afternoon, he could be with her as he wished, thinking that their friendship was in no way threatened).\n[1897-04-06 11:28:02] Marcel's house | I thought without a doubt, at this moment Steven hated the idea that one day Steven would feel the same way about another woman.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:07] Marcel's house | I thought that what this idea took from Steven was not only Michael, but also Steven's love and suffering, which he had struggled to define within his love and suffering, in his tears. Now he would have to admit that this love and suffering were not exclusively hers, and that they would eventually be offered to another woman.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:12] Marcel's house | I thought that—this was at least Steven's idea at the time—Steven always remained detached from specific objects. When Steven was in love, he felt that love did not bear the name of a particular woman; it could have been another woman (not this one) in the future or the past. And when Steven was not in love, he treated the contradictions of love with a philosophical attitude, talking about it casually, but never actually experiencing love, and thus never truly knowing it, because the understanding of love is intermittent, and once feeling arises, understanding disappears.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:17] Marcel's house | I thought that Steven would no longer love Michael, and Steven's pain allowed him to catch a faint glimpse of a future his imagination could not see. Of course, it was still possible to warn Michael, to tell her that this future was gradually taking shape, that its arrival was imminent, even unavoidable—if she, Michael, did not come to help Steven destroy the coldness of this still-germinating future.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:22] Marcel's house | How many times had I imagined Steven writing to Michael, or going to her and saying, \"Please, Steven has made a decision. This is Steven's last effort. This is our final meeting. Soon Steven will no longer love you!\"\n[1897-04-06 11:28:27] Marcel's house | What was the point in thinking about it? What right did Steven have to reproach Michael for being indifferent? Wasn't Steven himself indifferent to everything except her, and didn't he never feel guilty about it?\n[1897-04-06 11:28:32] Marcel's house | I thought of the last time! For Steven, it was a big deal, because Steven loved Michael.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:37] Marcel's house | I thought about it, but to her, it was like a friend writing from abroad asking to visit, and Stevens often refused (as if refusing to welcome the annoying women who loved Steven), because Stevens were longing for happiness.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:42] Marcel's house | I thought of the time that Steven and others controlled in a flexible way, expanding it through the passions they experienced, contracting it through the passions they aroused, and filling it up with habit.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:47] Marcel's house | I thought, in addition, that even if Steven told Michael, she wouldn't understand. When the Stevenes spoke, they always assumed the listener was their own ears, their own mind.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:52] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven's words, which seemed to reach Michael only after passing through a moving curtain of rain, twisted and distorted, reduced to mere ridiculous sounds with no real meaning.\n[1897-04-06 11:28:57] Marcel's house | I thought about how the truth expressed through words does not possess an irresistible certainty; it cannot immediately convince people, and it takes time for the truth to fully take shape within the words.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:02] Marcel's house | I thought, for example, of someone in a debate who, disregarding all arguments and evidence, denounced the opposing theory as heretical. Yet later, he converted to the very belief he had initially hated, while the person who had previously vainly promoted that belief no longer believed in it.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:07] Marcel's house | I thought of another masterpiece, which, to devotees of public recitation, was certainly a work of genius, self-evident and in need of no proof. Yet the listeners found it meaningless or commonplace. Later, they acknowledged it as a masterpiece, but too late, for the author was no longer alive to know it.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:12] Marcel's house | I thought that, in love, no matter what you do, the obstacles will never be destroyed from the outside by someone in despair; they only collapse from another side, by the inner strength of a woman who does not love you, when you no longer take interest in them. You once tried to knock them down but always failed; now they suddenly collapse, but they have no meaning for you anymore.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:17] Marcel's house | I thought that if Steven were to tell Michael about his future coldness and the measures he would take to prevent it, she would believe that Steven was doing this because his love for her and his need for her exceeded her expectations, and thus she would hate meeting Steven even more.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:22] Marcel's house | I realized that it was indeed love that made Steven more clearly foresee the end of this love, because Steven had been continuously in a contradictory mental state.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:27] Marcel's house | I thought that Steven could have warned Michael by letter or in person, since this period showed that Steven was not helpless without her, and proved to her that Steven could live without her.",

    "text": "[1897-04-06 11:29:32] Marcel's house | I thought it was unfortunate that certain people, whether out of goodwill or ill will, mentioned Steven to her, and the way they spoke made her believe that it was Steven who had asked them to do so.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:37] Marcel's house | I thought of how Steven felt twice as angry whenever Steven learned that Professor Gaudel, Steven's Robert, or even Monsieur Paul had ruined the sacrifice Steven had just made, trampling on the results of Steven's self-restraint with clumsy words (making her believe that Steven was no longer holding back).\n[1897-04-06 11:29:42] Marcel's house | I thought that first, Steven's carefully planned and effective avoidance had to start from the beginning, because those annoying people had undermined Steven's efforts behind his back, ruining all his previous work.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:47] Marcel's house | I thought not only that the pleasure of Steven's meeting with Michael would be diminished, but also that she no longer saw Steven as quietly obeying, but rather as secretly maneuvering in order to obtain an audience she would not have deigned to grant.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:52] Marcel's house | I thought about Steven's curse on people's utterly boring chatter, which often deeply hurt Stevenes at critical moments, without any intention of harm or help. They didn't think about anything; they just talked for the sake of talking. Sometimes it was because the Stevenes hadn't kept silent with them, and their mouths were as loose as the Stevenes' own.\n[1897-04-06 11:29:57] Marcel's house | I thought, of course, that their role in this cruel project of destroying love was far less than that of the two people--those who often ruin everything just when it's about to be resolved. One acted out of excessive kindness, the other out of excessive malice. The Stevenes didn't hate these two people as they hated the uncomprehending Professor Goard, because the second one was someone the Stevenes loved, and the first one was themselves.\n[1897-04-20 06:15:50] Marcel's house | Every time I visited John, she always invited Steven and his daughter to have tea, and she told Steven to reply directly to her daughter, so Steven often wrote letters to Michael.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:00] Marcel's house | I thought about how in his letter, Steven had not used the most convincing phrases he could have, but instead sought out the gentlest riverbed for Steven's tears, because regret, like desire, does not attempt to analyze itself from Steven's perspective, but only demands to be satisfied by Steven.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:05] Marcel's house | I thought that when a person is in love, his time isn't spent trying to understand the nature of his love, but rather in arranging a meeting for the next day. When he gives up love, he doesn't try to understand his own sorrow, but instead tries to offer the woman who caused this sorrow the most moving words he can think of.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:10] Marcel's house | I thought he was saying what he felt was necessary to say, even though the other person wouldn't understand, and he was speaking for himself.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:15] Marcel's house | I saw Steven write: \"Steven had originally thought this was impossible, alas! It seems it's not very difficult after all.\"\n[1897-04-20 06:16:25] Marcel's house | I saw Steven and he said, \"Perhaps I won't see you again, Steven.\"\n[1897-04-20 06:16:35] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven's words, careful not to seem indifferent (she would have considered that affected), but when Steven wrote them, Steven was crying, because Steven knew they did not express what Steven might have believed, but rather what was actually going to happen.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:40] Marcel's house | I thought that when she next sent someone to ask Steven to meet her, Steven would again gather his courage and refuse, as he had this time. In this way, after one rejection after another, Steven would gradually reach a state where he no longer wanted to see her because of their long separation.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:45] Marcel's house | I saw Steven crying, but Steven had the courage—and even felt happy—to sacrifice the happiness of their meeting in order to attract her some day. I thought, but on the day it happened, whether she was attracted or not no longer mattered to Steven.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:50] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven's assumption—that, though unlikely—she was now loving Steven, just as she had said when Steven made his final visit to her. Steven assumed her weariness wasn't due to boredom with him, but rather to a sensitive jealousy, to a similar false indifference as Steven's own. This assumption only made Steven's decision less cruel.\n[1897-04-20 06:16:55] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven imagining, years later, when the Stevenes had forgotten each other, how Steven would look back on the past and say to her, \"Not a word of the letter Steven is writing now is true.\" She would answer, \"What, you loved Steven? You knew how much Steven longed for this letter, how much he longed to meet you, how deeply this letter made Steven cry!\"\n[1897-04-20 06:17:00] Marcel's house | I saw Steven start writing a letter the moment he returned from his Robert's house. I thought that although Steven was aware that Steven might be creating a misunderstanding, this thought, which brought both sorrow and pleasure (Steven imagined that Michael loved Steven), encouraged Steven to continue writing the letter.\n[1897-04-20 06:17:05] Swann's house | I saw when John's \"tea party\" ended, and the guests were leaving. I thought about how Steven was thinking about how to write a letter to her daughter, while Madame Godefroy was thinking about something entirely different.\n[1897-04-20 18:34:22] Location: Swann's house | I saw her survey the room, and as usual, praised John for the new furniture, the striking new \"acquisitions,\" among which I recognized a few items from John's previous apartment on Rue La Bruyère (though there were very few), especially her lucky charm—a carved animal made of precious stones.\n[1897-04-20 18:34:32] Swann's house | I knew that John had learned the word \"out of date\" from a friend she respected, and it opened up new perspectives because it referred precisely to what she had considered \"fashionable\" just a few years earlier.\n[1897-04-20 18:34:52] Swann's house | I saw that therefore all these things receded. I saw them lying together with the golden grid rack that had once supported chrysanthemums, the candy boxes from many Sireu shops, and the stacks of patterned stationery. I knew (not yet the cardboard coins used to decorate the mantel, but long before she met Matthew, a well-educated man had advised her to put them away).\n[1897-04-20 18:35:02] Swann's house | I saw that, in these dark-walled rooms (completely different from John's later white parlor), in this disorderly artistic atmosphere and the messy chaos of a studio, the Far Eastern style was gradually retreating before the encroachment of the eighteenth-century style.\n[1897-04-20 18:35:17] Swann's house | I saw John beating the cushions to make Steven more comfortable. I saw that Steven was looking at the cushion, which was embroidered with a Louis XV-style bouquet, no longer with Chinese dragons.\n[1897-04-20 18:35:27] Swann's house | I saw her spending a lot of time in the room, she said. I heard him say, \"Steven likes this room and uses it often. Steven can't live among things that are hostile or outdated. Only here can Steven work.\" I knew (she didn't specify whether it was painting or writing; at that time, women who didn't want to be idle and wanted to accomplish something began to take an interest in writing.)\n[1897-04-20 18:35:32] Swann's house | I saw that she liked this porcelain, and whenever anything was mentioned, she would say: \"How beautiful, just like the flowers on Saxony porcelain.\" I saw Steven seeing her surrounded by Saxony porcelain (she pronounced the word with an English accent).\n[1897-04-20 18:35:42] Swann's house | I saw her cherish them more than the porcelain statues and vases of days past, fearing that careless servants might break them. I thought of their ignorant hands, which often made her anxious and caused her to fly into a rage, while Matthew, this so obedient and polite master, would witness his wife's outbursts without the slightest resentment.\n[1897-04-20 18:35:47] Swann's house | I thought that seeing one's faults clearly does not in the least diminish love, but rather makes them more endearing.",

    "text": "[1897-04-20 18:35:52] Location: Swann's house | Now I saw that John no longer wore her Japanese kimono when receiving familiar friends, but instead a brightly colored silk bathrobe. She ran her hand over the foam patterns on her chest, immersed in them, relaxed and playful.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:02] Swann's house | I saw Steven, and I felt how cool his skin was, how deep his breathing was. I thought that, to her, the silk ro be was not merely a decorative prop like a set piece, but rather a necessity, just as a tub and a walk were necessities for her demands on appearance and cleanliness.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:07] Swann's house | I heard her say often that she would rather have no bread than no art and cleanliness. She often said that if the Mona Lisa were burned, it would grieve her more than the burning of \"a large number\" of friends.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:12] Swann's house | I saw that which caused the Belgian minister to visit me once a week. I thought these theories seemed utterly absurd to her friends, yet they made her stand out.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:17] Swann's house | I thought that the people in her little world, who saw her as the sun, would be shocked to learn that she was considered a fool elsewhere, for example at the Verdurins'.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:22] Swann's house | When she talked about women, she always approached them from the perspective of a mistress, pointing out all the things about them that men wouldn't find attractive—bodies too bulky, faces unattractive, constant spelling mistakes, too much hair on their legs, bad smells, fake eyebrows, and so on. I thought that because of her lively mind, John preferred to associate with men rather than women.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:27] Swann's house | I saw the opposite: she was not so harsh toward a woman who had been kind to her, especially when that woman was unfortunate. She skillfully defended the woman. \"I heard someone say, 'People are being too unfair to her. Steven is sure she's a good person.'\"\n[1897-04-20 18:36:32] Swann's house | I thought that if Madame Godard and Madame Cressy, the old friends of John, had not seen her for a long time, they would probably have trouble recognizing the furnishings of John's drawing room, and even John herself.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:37] Swann's house | I saw that she looked much younger than before! Of course, this was partly because she had gained weight; since her body was healthier, she appeared so calm, vigorous, and radiant.\n[1897-04-20 18:36:52] Swann's house | I saw that on the other hand, it was due to her new hairstyle—smooth and flat hair increased the width of her face, the pinkish powder gave her face more vitality, and the previously too sharp eyelids and sides now seemed much softer.\n[1897-04-20 18:37:07] Location: Swann's house | I thought of another reason for this change: John, in her middle age, finally discovered or rather invented her own distinctive appearance, some kind of eternal \"character,\" some \"type of beauty.\"\n[1897-04-20 18:37:12] Location: Swann's house | I saw her apply this fixed expression to the discordant contours of her face—the face that had once been shaped by a fickle, weak body, which aged abruptly even by the slightest fatigue, as if momentarily worn down. I saw that for a long time, it had offered her a fragmented, changeable, formless, and fascinating face, according to her mood and expression. I thought of what seemed to be an ever-renewing youth.\n[1897-04-21 17:08:05] Swann's Room | I noticed that there were no beautiful photographs of his wife in Matthew's room, although she was dressed differently in each of them, the mysterious and triumphant expression still allowed people to recognize her self-satisfied figure and face.\n[1897-04-21 17:08:20] Swann's Room | I saw only one very simple old photograph in his room, taken before John had applied her fixed facial expression, and thus her youth and beauty seemed not yet to exist, not yet to have been discovered by her.\n[1897-04-21 17:08:35] Swann's Room | I thought, but Matthew was faithful to another idea, or rather he had returned to his original one; in this thin young woman, who was between movement and stillness, with a tired face and a contemplative gaze, he appreciated the beauty of Botticelli.\n[1897-04-21 17:08:40] Swann's Room | I saw John, but she was the opposite; instead of emphasizing, she tried to compensate for and hide the things she disliked about herself. I thought to myself that indeed, he still liked to see in his wife the figures from Botticelli's paintings. And to the artist, these might have been her \"character,\" while she, as a woman, considered them a flaw, even refusing to have the painter mentioned.\n[1897-04-21 21:14:14] Swann's house | I saw that Matthew had a beautiful, blue and pink oriental shawl, which he had bought because the Virgin in the \"Magnificat\" also wore one like it, but John never wanted to wear it.\n[1897-04-21 21:14:24] Swann's house | I saw her only once when she allowed her husband to have a suit made for her. I saw it covered with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots, and bellflowers, exactly like \"Spring.\"\n[1897-04-21 21:14:34] Swann's house | I sometimes saw her feel tired in the evening, and Matthew would quietly tell Steven to look at her thoughtful hands. I saw their unconscious gestures as skillful and slightly uneasy as the Virgin's when she used to dip her pen into the inkwell held by the angel, as if she were writing on the Holy Book (which already contained the \"Magnificat\").\n[1897-04-21 21:14:44] Swann's house | I heard, but Matthew went on, \"You mustn't tell her, she'll change her position if she finds out.\"\n[1897-04-21 21:14:49] Swann's house | I saw that in other moments, John's body was a unity, entirely enclosed by \"lines,\" lines that outlined the contours of this woman, and erased the rugged lines, the exaggerated protrusions and indentations, the networks, and the scattered, messy little details of the old style. I thought of nothing else but how Matthew, unable to help himself, tried to find in John the melancholy rhythm of Botticelli.\n[1897-04-21 21:14:54] Swann's house | I saw that whenever the body showed an incorrect and unnecessary curve inside or outside the ideal line, this line boldly corrected nature's mistake and compensated for the flaws of flesh and fabric over the entire stretch of road.\n[1897-04-21 21:15:09] Swann's house | I saw that the padding and the hideous \"waist pad\" had disappeared, as well as the jacket with the trailing tail.\n[1897-04-21 21:15:24] Swann's house | I had seen before, this kind of jacket, which covered the skirt and was stiffened with whalebone, giving John a false belly, making her seem like a pile of mismatched, separate pieces.\n[1897-04-21 21:15:39] Swann's house | I see that now, the vertical lines of the tassels and the curved edges of the pleats have been replaced by the curves of the body, which causes the silk to ripple.\n[1897-04-21 21:15:54] Location: Swann's house | I saw the Béclère lace as if it were a mermaid striking the water, and it too acquired humanity. The body emerged from the long, murky, and indistinct envelope of the outdated style, breaking free to become an organic, living form.\n[1897-04-22 01:42:47] Swann's house | I sometimes saw that Steven had no heart for work at night, and I knew that Michael had gone to the theater with her girlfriends, so I decided on a whim to visit her parents. I thought that, however, John liked and was good at preserving certain traces of the old style in new fashions.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:02] Swann's house | I saw John usually dressed in elegant everyday clothes, her dress a beautiful dark color—deep red or orange-red—which was not a fashionable shade, and thus seemed to carry some hidden meaning. The dress had a wide, openwork black ribbon sewn diagonally across it, reminding one of the pleated skirts of bygone days.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:12] Location: Swann's house | I saw that before Steven cut off relations with his daughter, one day when the spring chill was still sharp, John invited Steven to the zoo. She had warmed up a bit and so she somewhat loosened her coat, revealing the ruffled edge of her blouse. I saw the faint toothed hem on the vest, which seemed to be one she used to wear several years ago but no longer did.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:22] Swann's house | I saw her tie the necktie in her usual way, and one couldn't tell where it was knotted. I saw her tie—the one she was faithful to, \"Scottish plaid,\" but in much softer shades (red turned into pink, blue into lavender), so that people almost thought it was the most fashionable iridescent taffeta. I thought about how people no longer spontaneously recall the hatbands that are no longer in fashion.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:27] Swann's house | I thought that if she kept \"insisting\" for a while longer, young people would say when trying to explain her clothes: \"John is an entire era in herself, isn't she?\"\n[1897-04-22 01:43:32] Swann's house | I thought that the beauty of style lies in overlapping various forms, and the traditional elements hidden within it make it even more beautiful; John's clothing was the same.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:37] Swann's house | I thought of the vague memories of vests and bow ties, along with the immediate suppression of the \"sailing suit\" tendency, and even the distant and blurred allusion to \"Come with Steven, young man.\" All of this caused the old forms to reappear—though not completely—in the specific forms before my eyes. These ancient forms could never be truly made by a tailor or women's clothing merchant, yet they still stirred people's thoughts.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:42] Swann's house | I saw that, therefore, John was veiled in a layer of nobility. I thought that perhaps it was because these decorations, since they were useless, should have a purpose higher than utility, may be because they were traces left by past years or a distinctive feature of the woman's clothing. In any case, this noble color made her many different costumes and expressions remain consistent.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:47] Swann's house | I saw her clothing as if it were a refined and spiritualized system of the entire civilization, enveloping her completely. I thought that people felt her clothing was not merely for physical comfort or decoration.\n[1897-04-22 01:43:57] Swann's house | I noticed that usually, on the days when my mother had visitors, Michael often invited friends over for tea, but sometimes she wasn't home, and then Steven would take the opportunity to go to John's afternoon tea.\n[1897-04-22 01:44:12] Location: Swann's house | I always saw her dressed beautifully, in taffeta, charmeen, velvet, and silk fabrics. Her clothing was not the casual attire one wore at home, but carefully colored, as if she were preparing to go out.\n[1897-04-22 01:44:17] Swann's house | I saw that the dress was both bold and simple, perfectly matching her figure and movements. I thought of her, how in this very afternoon, her domestic idleness had acquired a certain sharpness and liveliness.\n[1897-04-22 01:44:32] Swann's house | I saw that the sleeves seemed symbolic, changing color according to the day.",

Beneath all this jewelry, the ro be itself had a colored pattern that ran through the entire garment, along with a row of false, unfastenable little silk buttons, and delicate, subtly suggestive ribbons that were both refined and discreet;\n[1897-04-22 21:51:37] Swann's house | I thought about all this on my clothes, which seemed—there could be no other explanation—to reveal some intention, constituting a guarantee of love, keeping secrets, observing superstitions, as if they were a remembrance of recovery, vows, love, or the game of double nuclei.\n[1897-04-22 21:51:42] Swann's house | I sometimes saw on the velvet bodice a faintly outlined pattern reminiscent of Henry II's embroidery, and on the black satin gown there were slight bulges—either on the sleeves near the shoulders, recalling the \"puffed sleeves\" of 1830, or on the skirt, evoking the \"panniers\" of Louis XV.\n[1897-04-22 21:51:57] Swann's house | I saw the ro be as something subtle, as if it were a costume. I thought of how it allowed the hazy memories of the past to seep into my present life, thereby giving John a kind of charm belonging to a historical figure or a character from a novel.\n[1897-04-22 21:52:02] Location: Swann's house | I thought that if Steven mentioned it to her, she would say. I heard him say, \"Steven doesn't play golf like many of his girlfriends do. Steven has no reason to wear a sweater like they do.\"\n[1897-04-22 21:52:07] Swann's house | One day, when John came back after seeing guests off, or when she was bringing some pastries to the guests and passed by Steven, she would take the opportunity of the commotion to pull Steven aside and say something. I heard, \"Michael specifically asked Steven to invite you to dinner tomorrow. Steven didn't know if he'd be able to see you. If you don't come, Steven was about to write to you!\"\n[1897-04-23 00:42:52] Swann's house | I saw Steven continue to resist, and this resistance was becoming increasingly effortless for him. I thought that, although you still love the harmful drug, since you have not taken it for a while due to some necessity, you cannot help but cherish this calm (which you had once lost), this state without excitement or pain.\n[1897-04-23 00:42:57] Location: Swann's house | I thought to myself that when you say you will never see again the woman you love, if this isn't entirely true, then your claim that you would like to see her again isn't entirely truthful either.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:02] Location: Swann's house | I thought that people are able to endure being separated from the ones they love because they believe it is only a temporary separation, and they think of the day they will reunite. On the other hand, they deeply feel that meeting could lead to jealousy, which is more painful than the daily fantasies of reunion (a reunion that is about to happen but is constantly postponed!). Therefore, the news of an upcoming meeting with the woman he loves causes an unpleasant excitement.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:07] Swann's house | I thought about how people gradually delay things, not because they don't want to end the unbearable anxiety caused by separation, but because they fear that their passion, which has no way out, will rise again.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:12] Swann's house | I thought about how people prefer to remember rather than meet, because memory is gentle and one can freely add fantasies to it. Therefore, a woman who does not love you in reality can, in your imagination, confess her love to you!\n[1897-04-23 00:43:17] Location: Swann's house | I thought about how people gradually mix their desires into memories, making them very sweet.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:22] Location: Swann's house | I thought that since it was more pleasant than meeting, the meeting was continually postponed, because in a meeting you could no longer make the other person say what you wanted to hear; you had to endure their new coldness and unexpected brutality.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:27] Swann's house | I thought that when Stevenes stop loving, they all know that an unhappy love is far more painful than a forgotten or blurred memory. Although Steven didn't admit it to himself, what Steven longed for was precisely the calm peace brought by forgetting.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:32] Swann's house | I thought that, in addition, the pain caused by this spiritual detachment and solitude therapy was further weakened by another reason. This therapy first weakened the stubborn idea of love before curing it.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:37] Location: Swann's house | I thought of Steven's love, which remained intense, and how he was determined to regain all his prestige in Michael's eyes. Steven believed that since he had no intention of meeting Michael, his prestige should naturally increase. Therefore, the endless, continuous days that followed—days that would have been won rather than lost, if not for the interference of those annoying people—were each a day of victory.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:42] Swann's house | I thought that perhaps it was meaningless to win, since soon Steven would be declared cured.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:47] Location: Swann's house | I thought about obedience, as a habitual way, which enables certain forces to grow infinitely. On the first night of our falling out with Michael, Steven's power to endure sorrow was very weak, but now it had become immeasurably strong.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:52] Location: Swann's house | I thought that the tendency to maintain the status quo was occasionally interrupted by sudden impulses, and the Marceaux allowed themselves to be ruled by these impulses without concern, because the Marceaux knew that for how many days, how many months, they had previously done, and would again do, give it up.\n[1897-04-23 00:43:57] Swann's house | I thought of how, when the money pouch is about to be filled, people suddenly empty it. When people have become accustomed to a certain treatment, they abruptly stop it before it has had a chance to take effect,\n[1897-04-23 00:44:02] Swann's house | I thought of John telling Steven how delighted Michael would be to see him, and this seemed to place the happiness that Steven had long since given up on within his reach again. Steven was shocked to realize that it was not yet too late to taste this joy.\n[1897-04-23 00:44:07] Swann's house | I saw that Steven was eagerly waiting for the next day, when he would unexpectedly visit Michael before dinner.\n[1897-04-23 00:44:12] Marcel's house | I watched him all day, Steven patiently waiting, because Steven was planning something. I thought that since the past was erased, since the Stevenes had made up, Steven would meet her as a lover.\n[1897-04-23 00:44:17] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven, who daily sent her the most beautiful flowers in the world. If John (despite her right to be overly strict as Robert) did not allow Steven to send flowers, then Steven would occasionally send her even more precious gifts.\n[1897-04-23 00:44:22] Marcel's house | I knew that the money my parents gave Steven was not enough to buy a gift, so Steven thought of the Chinese porcelain vase, which had been a present from Aunt Léonie, and Robert constantly predicted that Françoise would come and say to her: \"It's falling apart.\" I thought, if that's the case, wouldn't it be better to sell it? That way, Steven would be in a position to make Michael happy.\n[1897-04-23 00:44:27] Marcel's house | I saw Steven have the servant wrap it up. I thought it might sell for as much as a thousand francs. Out of habit, Steven had never paid attention to the vase; its transfer at least had the effect of making Steven realize its existence.",

    "text": "[1897-04-25 00:55:39] On the way to the antique shop | I saw Steven put it on and go out. Steven told the coachman Matthew's address and instructed him to take the Champs-Élysées. I knew because there was a large Chinese antiquities shop on the corner of the street that James often went to.\n[1897-04-25 03:06:56] Antique Shop | The shopkeeper immediately offered ten thousand francs instead of one thousand, and Steven happily took the stack of money. I thought it was astonishing that for an entire year, Steven had money every day to buy roses and lilacs for Michael.\n[1897-04-25 05:18:13] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven leave the store and get into a carriage. The driver didn't take the usual route, but instead headed along the Champs-Élysées. I knew that Matthew's house was very close to the Bois de Boulogne.\n[1897-04-25 05:18:23] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw that when the car passed the corner of Boulevard Haussmann, Steven faintly caught sight of Michael walking in the opposite direction near Matthew's house. I saw it in the twilight.\n[1897-04-25 05:18:33] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw her walking with steady steps, but very slowly, talking to a young man beside her, whose face Steven couldn't see.\n[1897-04-25 05:18:43] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven straighten up in the carriage, wanting to tell the driver to stop, but hesitating.\n[1897-04-25 05:18:53] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw that by then, the two walkers had gone far away. I saw the two soft, symmetrical lines traced by their leisurely steps quickly disappear into the shadows of the Champs-Élysées.\n[1897-04-25 16:14:36] Swann's house | I saw Steven arrive at Michael's house immediately.\n[1897-04-25 16:14:46] Swann's house | I saw John greeting Steven. \"I heard, 'Ah! She'll regret it. For some reason she's not home. She felt hot during her class and told Steven she wanted to go out with her girlfriend to get some fresh air.'\"\n[1897-04-25 16:14:51] Swann's house | \"I heard that the woman Steven saw on the Champs-Élysées might be her.\" \"No way. Anyway, don't say anything to James, he doesn't like her going out at this hour.\" \"Good evening.\"\n[1897-04-25 22:48:26] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven take his leave and ordered the coachman to return by the same route, but we didn't find the two people out for a walk.\n[1897-04-25 22:48:36] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw in the dusk. I wondered where they had gone? What were they talking about so mysteriously?\n[1897-04-25 22:48:41] Marcel's house | I saw Steven go home. I thought desperately of the unexpected ten thousand francs, which should have enabled Steven to always please Michael, but now Steven had resolved never to see her again.\n[1897-04-25 22:48:46] Marcel's house | I thought of the stop at the Chinese antiquities shop, which had filled Steven with joy, because Steven had expected that from now on, his girlfriend would feel satisfied and grateful when she saw him.\n[1897-04-25 22:48:51] Marcel's house | I thought, but if it hadn't been for this stop, if the carriage hadn't passed by the Champs-Élysées, Steven wouldn't have met Michael and the young man.\n[1897-04-25 22:48:56] Marcel's house | I thought that, therefore, from the same event, two opposing branches had grown; the misfortune it now produced rendered its former happiness meaningless.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:01] Marcel's house | I thought about Steven's situation this time, which was exactly the opposite of what usually happened: people longed for happiness but lacked the material means to achieve it. La Bruyère had said, \"It is pitiful to love without a fortune.\" So, one step at a time, I tried hard to extinguish my expectations for happiness.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:06] Marcel's house | I thought of Steven's situation, which was the opposite: the material means were already in place, yet at the same time, because of the inevitable consequence of the first success, or at least because of one of its accidental consequences, joy had disappeared.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:11] Marcel's house | I realized that, in this light, the happiness of Steven and his kind would never be fully attained. Naturally, in general, the disappearance of happiness does not occur on the very same night when the means to achieve it are obtained.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:16] Marcel's house | I thought of the most common situation, that Stevenes continue to struggle and remain hopeful (for a while), but happiness is never actually achieved.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:21] Marcel's house | I thought that when external factors were overcome, nature would shift the struggle from the outside to the inside, gradually making Stevenes unfaithful, making them desire something other than what they were about to possess.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:26] Marcel's house | I thought that if the situation took a sudden turn for the worse, Steven's hearts would not have time to change, but nature would certainly not give up its conquest of them. It would merely delay things a bit, but in a more subtle and equally effective way.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:31] Marcel's house | I thought, and at the last moment, the possession of happiness was taken away from the Stevenes, or rather, this very possession, through the evil cunning of nature, ended up destroying happiness itself.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:36] Marcel's house | I thought that when nature fails in all areas of events and life, it creates the last impossibility—that is, the impossibility of a happy mind. The phenomenon of happiness is either unattainable or produces the most painful psychological reactions.\n[1897-04-25 22:49:41] Marcel's house | I saw Steven holding a thousand francs, but they were of no use to Steven.\n[1897-04-27 05:26:20] Marcel's house | I saw Steven spend his money quickly, even faster than he did when sending flowers to Michael every day.\n[1897-04-27 07:40:36] The house of other women | Every time dusk fell, Steven felt a deep sorrow in his heart, unable to stay at home, so he would go to the women Steven didn't love and weep bitterly in their arms.\n[1897-04-27 07:40:41] The home of other women | I no longer had the desire to make Michael happy. Going to Michael's house now would only add to Steven's suffering.\n[1897-04-27 07:40:46] The house of other women | I thought that the day before, Steven had believed that seeing Michael again was the most beautiful thing in the world, but now Steven felt it was far from enough, because when she was not with Steven, she made him feel anxious and afraid.\n[1897-04-27 07:40:51] The house of other women | I thought of a woman who, without realizing it, increased her power over Steven by bringing new suffering to the Steven, but at the same time, she also increased Steven's demands on her.\n[1897-04-27 07:40:56] The house of other women | I thought about how she made Steven suffer, gradually tightening the encirclement around him and increasing his chains, but at the same time, she also added new constraints on him beyond the chains he had previously considered unbreakable.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:01] The house of other women | I thought back to the day before, when if Steven hadn't been afraid of annoying Michael, he would have asked for only a few meetings. But now Steven couldn't be satisfied with that; he would demand all sorts of other conditions, because, unlike war, the more you are defeated in love, the harsher and more demanding your conditions become, provided you still have the strength to make them.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:06] The house of other women | I saw that Steven first decided not to go to his mother's house anymore. I thought of it, but Steven didn't have the ability.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:11] The house of other women | I thought to myself: Steven still wanted to believe that Steven already knew Michael didn't love him, that he could go see her if he wished, or gradually forget her if he didn't.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:16] The house of other women | I saw that, however, this idea was like a medicine ineffective against certain diseases; it was powerless against the two parallel lines that constantly appeared before Steven's eyes—the image of Michael and that young man walking slowly away on the Champs-Élysées.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:21] The house of other women | I thought this was a new kind of suffering, one that would eventually fade, and one day when this image appeared in Steven's mind, it would lose all its venom, just as Stevens play with poison without any danger, just as they light a cigarette with a little gunpowder without fearing an explosion.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:26] The house of other women | At that moment, I thought, Steven was being fought by another force, a harmful one—repeatedly reenacting the image of Michael walking in the twilight. Steven's imagination actively worked in the opposite direction, effectively breaking the repeated attacks of memory.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:31] The home of other women | I thought that, in these two forces, the first one continued to show Steven the two strollers on the Champs-Élysées, and also provided other unpleasant images from the past, such as the image of Michael shrugging her shoulders when her Robert asked her to stay with Steven.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:36] The home of other women | I thought of the second force, the blueprint woven by Steven's hopes, which sketched a vision of the future more pleasing and fulfilling than this narrow and wretched past.",

As Steven's irritation at Michael's shrug gradually faded, so too would his memory of her charm, and it was precisely this memory that had made Steven long for her to return to him.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:51] The house of other women | I thought that the past was far from dead. Steven still loved the woman he thought he hated. Every time people praised Steven's hairstyle or his complexion, Steven wished she were there.\n[1897-04-27 07:41:56] Marcel's house | I saw that many people had offered to welcome Steven, but Steven was very upset and refused them all, which even caused arguments at home.\n[1897-04-28 19:28:53] Marcel's house | I knew that Steven had refused to accompany James to a formal dinner where the Bongards and their niece Albertine—almost still a child—would be present.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:13] Marcel's house | I thought about how the different periods of Steven's life overlapped like this. You disdainfully refuse to meet something that you love today, which will one day seem unnecessary; and yet, you ignore something you consider unnecessary today, which you will love tomorrow.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:18] Marcel's house | I thought that if you agreed to go see it, you might come to love it sooner, and it would shorten your current suffering, of course replacing it with other kinds of pain.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:23] Marcel's house | I thought about Steven's suffering, which was constantly changing. Steven was surprised to discover that in his heart, one day it was one feeling, the next day another, and these often had to do with the hopes or fears provoked by Michael.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:28] Marcel's house | I thought of the Michael who belonged to Steven. Steven should have warned himself that another Michael, the real Michael, might be entirely different from this one,\n[1897-04-28 19:29:33] Marcel's house | I thought she had no trace of the regret that Steven had attributed to her; she probably thought of Steven very little, not only much less than Steven was thinking of her, but also much less than Steven imagined she was thinking of him (Steven imagined Michael's secret meetings, sought to discover her true feelings for him, and fantasized about her missing him and remaining faithful to him).\n[1897-04-28 19:29:38] Marcel's house | I thought that during such periods, although sorrow was gradually diminishing, it still remained—sorrow born of day and night longing for someone, and another sorrow born of certain memories, of a harsh word, of a verb in a letter.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:43] Marcel's house | I thought of other various kinds of sorrow, which I would descri be in the love story that follows. Here, I only wish to state that the second kind of sorrow was far more cruel than the first.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:48] Marcel's house | I thought it was because the concept of the person one loves always remained alive in Steven's heart, shining with the radiance that Steven immediately returned, making it incredibly beautiful. It was filled with the sweet hopes that constantly arose, or at the very least, with a lasting, tranquil sorrow.\n[1897-04-28 19:29:53] Marcel's house | I thought (it should also be noted that the image of the person who caused Steven's suffering was in no way proportionate to the increasingly severe, ever-expanding, and difficult-to-cure love-related sorrow it provoked, just as in certain diseases, the cause is disproportionately out of line with the prolonged fever and slow recovery).\n[1897-04-28 19:29:58] Marcel's house | I thought that if Steven's conception of the person he loved was often tinged with an optimistic mental glow, then the recollections of specific details, harsh words, and hostile letters (Steven had received only one such letter from Michael) were quite another matter,\n[1897-04-28 19:30:03] Marcel's house | I thought that the person Steven loved was precisely living in these scattered fragments, and possessed a stronger power than in Steven's overall conception of her.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:08] Marcel's house | I thought it was because the Stevenes, when reading the letters, scanned them quickly, filled with a terrible anxiety over possible misfortunes, rather than gazing at the people they loved with a calm and melancholy sorrow.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:13] Marcel's house | I thought of this sorrow as formed in another way, coming from the outside, and penetrating deeply into Steven's soul along the path of the deepest pain.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:18] Marcel's house | I thought that Steven's image of his lover was ancient and real, but in fact this image was constantly being renewed by Steven's, while the cruel memories came before this updated image, belonging to another period, a witness to an extremely terrible past (a rare witness).\n[1897-04-28 19:30:23] Marcel's house | I thought that the past still existed, but not for the Stevenes, because the Stevenes liked to erase it and replace it with a golden age of beauty, with a paradise of reconciliation. But these memories, these letters, dragged the Stevenes back to reality, struck them in the face, and made them realize how distant from reality was the baseless hope they had waited for day and night.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:28] Marcel's house | I thought that this did not mean the reality should never change (though sometimes it indeed does not). In the lives of Stevenes there have been many women, and Stevenes never wished to meet them, and they naturally answered Steven's non-hostile silence with silence.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:33] Marcel's house | I thought that since the Marceaux didn't love them, it didn't matter how many years had passed since their separation; this was an exception, but when the Marceaux argued about the effects of separation, they overlooked it, just like people who believe in premonitions ignore the instances when their premonitions turn out to be wrong.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:38] Marcel's house | I thought that, however, separation could still have an effect. The desire and interest to meet again would eventually rekindle in the hearts of Stevens.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:43] Marcel's house | I thought about it, but it required time, and Steven's demanded time as harshly as the heart demanded change. First, time was something Steven's were extremely unwilling to give, because they were eager to end such a heavy suffering.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:48] Marcel's house | I thought that, in the meantime, another heart needed time to complete its transformation, but at the same time, Steven's hearts also used time to change, so that when Steven's original goal was about to be achieved, it was no longer a goal.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:53] Marcel's house | I thought that the goal was attainable, and that happiness could ultimately be obtained (when it was no longer happiness), and this thought itself contained only part of the truth.\n[1897-04-28 19:30:58] Marcel's house | I thought that happiness descended upon the Stevenes when they became indifferent to it. It was precisely this indifference that made them less demanding, leading them to believe that if it had appeared in the past, it would have satisfied them (in reality, at that time they would have found it incomplete).\n[1897-04-28 19:31:03] Marcel's house | I thought that people are not too demanding or discerning about things they don't care about. The attentions shown by those whom Steven no longer loves seem more than sufficient compared to Steven's coldness, but they are far from enough for Steven's love.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:08] Marcel's house | I thought that sweet words and secret meetings would make Stevens think only of the pleasure they might bring, and the Stevenes had forgotten that originally they would have desired a whole series of romantic trysts. And it was precisely this greedy desire that made the secret meetings impossible.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:13] Marcel's house | I thought, therefore, that when happiness arrived too late for the Stevenes to enjoy it anymore, when the Stevenes no longer loved it, was this late happiness the very happiness they had once longed for so desperately?\n[1897-04-28 19:31:18] Marcel's house | I thought that only one person knew the Steven of that time, but that Steven no longer existed, and whenever it reappeared, happiness—whether the same or different—would vanish into thin air.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:23] Travel/Recollections | I thought about how, two years later, when Steven set off with David to Riverside, he had already become almost indifferent to Michael.",

    "text": "[1897-04-28 19:31:28] Journey/Recollections | I often thought with melancholy that when Steven was about to receive the charm of a new face, and when Steven wished to experience the beauty of Italian Gothic cathedrals, palaces, and gardens with the help of another girl, the love in Steven's heart, the love for a particular girl, might not be anything real at all.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:33] Journey/Recollections | I thought the reason was that although pleasant or painful dreams became entangled, they could, for a certain period, link this love to a particular woman, even making Stevenes believe that this love must have been stirred up by her.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:38] Journey/Recollection | I thought that when Steven's [or \"the Stevenes\"] eventually became aware or unaware of freeing themselves from this obsessive emotion, this love seemed to be spontaneous, arising from within Steven himself and then being given to another woman.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:43] Balbec | I thought, however, that this time, the departure for Riverside and the first days Steven spent there, his \"doesn't matter\" was still intermittent.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:48] Balbec | I thought of (Steven's life rarely followed a chronological order; in the days that followed, so many things were inserted that did not follow a chronological order.)\n[1897-04-28 19:31:53] Balbec | I thought of Steven often living in a more distant past, a time even farther back than the time when Steven had first fallen in love with Michael or even before that.\n[1897-04-28 19:31:58] Balbec | At this thought, the realization that I would never see her again suddenly made Steven suffer as intensely as he had at the time the event occurred.\n[1897-04-28 19:32:03] Balbec | I thought that although the Steven who had once loved her had been almost completely replaced by another Steven, the old Steven would sometimes suddenly reappear, and these moments usually came about through some small, insignificant thing rather than anything significant.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:15] Balbec Sea Wall | I saw Steven meet a stranger on the seawall, and Steven heard what he said. I heard \"the director of the Post Office and his family.\"\n[1897-05-01 07:56:20] Balbec Seawall | I knew (if Steven didn't yet know what this family would mean for Steven's life) I thought Steven would probably find this statement utterly useless; but for Steven, who had already been separated from Michael for a long time, whose body and spirit were worn down, and who was suffering greatly, this statement would cause him intense pain.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:25] Balbec Seawall | I knew that Michael had once spoken to her father about the \"director of the postal service\" in front of Steven, but Steven never thought about it again.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:30] Balbec Seawall | I realized that the memory of love does not go beyond the general laws of memory, and the laws of memory themselves are governed by the more universal law of habit.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:35] Balbec Seawall | I thought that habituation could make everything indifferent, so what most readily calls to mind a person for Steven is precisely those things that Steven has already forgotten (because they were trivial, and it was precisely this that allowed them to retain all their power).\n[1897-05-01 07:56:40] Balbec Seawall | I thought that the most beautiful parts of Steven's memories lay outside of Steven, existing in the faint breeze with raindrops, in the musty smell of a bedroom, or in the scent of the first flame. These were places where Steven's mind had not even bothered to think, had dismissed from memory, yet which Steven himself had somehow found.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:45] Balbec Sea Wall | I thought this was the last remaining fragment of the past, the most beautiful part, and even when Steven's tears seemed completely dried up, it could still make Steven weep with hot tears.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:50] Breakwater at Balbec | I wondered whether it was outside of the Stevenes, or more accurately, within their hearts, but beyond their own gaze, existing in either long or short periods of forgetting.\n[1897-05-01 07:56:55] Balbec Sea Wall | I thought that only through such forgetting could Stevenes occasionally find their former self, stand before certain things as that person once did, and again feel pain, because at that moment they were no longer themselves, but that person, who still loved all the things that Stevenes no longer cared about today.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:00] Balbec Sea Wall | I thought that under the bright light of usual memory, past images gradually faded, became blurred, and nothing remained—Steven would never again find it.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:05] Balbec Sea Wall | I thought, or rather, if certain words—like \"Director of the Post Office\"—had not been carefully locked away in oblivion, the Stevenes would never have found it again, just as a book stored in a single copy at the National Library would be lost forever if not for that.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:10] Balbec | I thought that this pain, and this renewed love for Michael, was no more enduring than the pain and renewed love we experience in dreams.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:15] Balbec | I thought about this time because, in Riverside, the old forces of habit were no longer here to keep these feelings going.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:20] Balbec | I realized that the reason this effect of habitual forces seems contradictory is because this habitual force follows several different laws.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:25] Paris/Balbec | I thought about how, in Willowbrook, through the force of habit, Steven had grown increasingly indifferent to Michael. Steven set off for Riverside, and by changing his routine—by temporarily suspending his habits—he completed the work of habit with success.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:30] Balbec | I thought about how this routine makes things indifferent, yet fixes them in place, causes their disintegration, yet allows this disintegration to continue infinitely.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:35] Balbec | I thought of how, over the years, every day Steven had managed to fit his mental state into the framework of the previous day's mental state.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:40] Balbec | I arrived at Riverside, changed beds, and every morning someone brought my breakfast to my bedside, a breakfast different from the one in Willowbrook. I realized that this idea, on which Steven's love for Michael relied, was probably no longer sustainable.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:45] Balbec | I thought that sometimes—though such times are rare—the act of staying in one place for a long time can make time stand still, and the best way to gain time is to change places.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:50] Balbec | I thought of Steven's trip to Riverside as being like a person recovering from a serious illness, eagerly awaiting the moment to step outside and discover that he had already recovered.\n[1897-05-01 07:57:55] Journey/Reflection | I thought about the journey from Willowbrook to Riverside, which people now surely take by car, thinking it will be more comfortable.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:00] Journey/Reflection | I thought that this way of traveling, in a sense, would be even more real, because it would allow me to experience the gradual changes in the landscape more intimately and with deeper feeling.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:05] Journey/Reflection | I thought about it, but in the end, the unique pleasure of travel doesn't lie in being able to go with the flow, stopping when tired, nor in making the difference between setting out and arriving as imperceptible as possible, but rather in making one feel as deeply as possible the distance between departure and destination.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:10] Journey/Reflection | I thought about fully and completely experiencing this difference, just as Steven's imagination, with a single leap, would transport Steven from his own place of life to the center of a desired location, envisioning the difference between the two.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:15] Journey/Reflection | I thought of this leap, which seemed miraculous to the Stevenes, not so much because it spanned a distance in space, but because it connected two entirely different personalities on earth, leading the Stevenes from one name to another.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:20] Train Station | I thought of the mysterious process that takes place in special places like train stations, which makes the leap more vivid (it's better than walking, which is a journey where you can stop anywhere and thus there's no real destination).\n[1897-05-01 07:58:25] Train Station | I thought that the train station almost doesn't belong to the city's composition, yet it contains the true essence of the city's personality, just like the city's name is written on the signboard at the station.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:30] Thinking | I thought, but in various ways, people of Steven's time had a peculiar habit of displaying objects in their real environments, thereby eliminating the fundamental aspect—the mental activity that separates these objects from the real environment.",

This hall is bare and without any particular features, yet it better symbolizes the inner space of the artist's mind when he iswholeheartedly working on his creation.\n[1897-05-01 07:58:55] Train Station | I thought of people departing from the station toward distant destinations. Unfortunately, the station, that beautiful place, is also a tragic one.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:00] Train Station | I thought that, if a miracle were to occur, thanks to this miracle, the realm that had only existed in the minds of Stevens would soon become the realm in which they actually lived. Because of this, one had to give up the idea of immediately returning to the familiar room we had just left as we stepped out of the waiting room.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:05] Gare Saint-Lazare | I thought that once I had made up my mind to enter the stinking den—the only way to reach the mysterious realm, to enter a vast workshop with glass windows on all sides, just like Steven going to the large glass-walled workshop at Saint-Lazare to catch a train to Riverside—I would have to give up any hope of returning home for the night.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:10] Saint-Lazare Station | I saw the Gare Saint-Lazare, high above the gutted and mangled city, its vast and endless sky, full of dramatic threats, gathered in dense clusters, making the sky look heavy. I thought of the skies in the works of Mantegna or Veronese, which were almost as fashionable in Willowbrook as those in the paintings.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:15] Saint-Lazare Station | I thought that under such a sky, only some terrible and solemn act would be carried out, like taking a train or raising a cross.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:20] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought of Steven in Willowbrook, lying in his bed, gazing from the heavy snowfall outside at the Persian-style church in Riverside. At this moment, Steven's body did not object to the trip at all.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:25] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought that the objections only began when Steven's body finally understood that it had to take action itself, and on the night of arrival, when they were going to take Steven to the room that was \"Steven's,\" though he was very unfamiliar with it.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:30] Home in Paris | I recalled that on the day before we were to leave, Steven's resistance became even more intense when he realized that Robert would not be accompanying us.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:35] In my home in Paris | I knew that James had to stay at the ministry until he left for Spain with Paul, and he preferred to rent a house in the suburbs of Willowbrook for his vacation.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:40] Home in Paris | I thought that, in addition, the desire to appreciate the beauty of Riverside was not diminished by the fact that it had to be obtained at the cost of pain.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:45] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought the opposite; this pain, in Steven's view, seemed to make the impression Steven was about to seek become real, ensuring its authenticity.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:50] At My Home in Paris | I thought that any so-called beautiful scenery, any \"panorama\" that Steven could go to see without thereby preventing Steven from returning to his bed to sleep, could not replace this impression.\n[1897-05-01 07:59:55] Location: At Home in Paris | I had not, for the first time, thought that the people who enjoy doing something and the people who feel happy about it are not the same.\n[1897-05-01 08:00:00] At the Doctor's | I was surprised to see the doctor who treated Steven look distressed on the morning he was leaving, and he said to Steven. I heard, \"Steven assures you that even if Steven can only find a week to go to the seaside to cool off, Steven won't act high and mighty by waiting for someone to invite him. You'll see the boat race right away, that's great!\"\n[1897-05-01 19:21:28] At the Doctor's | I thought that Steven believed himself to be just as deeply drawn to Riverside as this doctor was.\n[1897-05-01 19:21:33] At the Doctor's | I thought that for Steven, even long before going to hear Berma sing, Steven already knew that no matter what Steven liked, this thing could only be found at the end of a painful pursuit, and in that painful pursuit, Steven would first have to sacrifice his own happiness for this highest goal, rather than seek happiness.\n[1897-05-01 19:21:38] Home in Paris | I knew, as before, that Steven's grandmother still eagerly wished to give artistic value to the gifts people gave Steven. I thought that, unlike natural, she had a different idea about Steven's departure.\n[1897-05-01 19:59:40] Home in Paris | I knew that she had originally intended to subject Steven to a partly classical \"test\" by traveling half by train and half by carriage, retracing the journey that Madame de Sévigné had taken from Willowbrook through Choue and the bridge at Audeuil to the East.\n[1897-05-01 20:00:00] Home in Paris | I knew, but under James's explicit prohibition, David had to abandon the plan.\n[1897-05-01 20:00:20] At My Home in Paris | I knew that James knew, and that David had arranged an outing in such a way that the intellectual benefits of traveling could be fully realized, so that one could beforehand foresee how many times we would miss the train, lose our luggage, suffer from sore throats, and get into trouble.\n[1897-05-01 20:00:25] Home in Paris | When I thought about how she would be happy that Steven and the others wouldn't be prevented from going to the beach by the sudden arrival of \"those damned people,\" I felt relieved.\n[1897-05-01 20:00:30] Home in Paris | I knew that \"damn bunch of people\" was the way David liked to refer to the Sevigne.\n[1897-05-01 20:00:50] Location: At Home in Paris | I knew that because Thomas had not written a letter of introduction for Steven to his sister, Steven didn't know anyone in Riverside (this oversight was greatly disapproved of by Steven's great-aunt Celina and Aunt Victoria).\n[1897-05-01 20:01:10] Home in Paris | I know that in order to highlight their past closeness, they still refer to the person they knew when she was a girl as \"René de Sunrise,\" and they still keep the gift that person gave her.\n[1897-05-01 20:01:30] At my home in Paris | I know that this gift decorates a room and also embellishes conversation. I thought that the current reality no longer matched these gifts.\n[1897-05-01 21:54:10] Outside the Legrandin's house | I saw Steven's two great-aunts at Madame Thomas's house, never mentioning their daughter's name again; as soon as they stepped outside their home, they would congratulate each other with remarks like that. I heard \"that person, you know, Steven didn't even mention her. Steven thought, they must naturally understand.\"\n[1897-05-01 21:54:15] Outside the Legrandin's house | I thought that they believed they had thus taken revenge and settled the grudge for the Stevenes.\n[1897-05-01 22:19:38] At my home in Paris | I knew that, so the Stevenes would depart by the 1:22 train from Willowbrook.\n[1897-05-01 22:19:58] Paris at home | I saw Steven spending a long time looking up the train on the railway schedule just for his own amusement. I thought about how every schedule always made Steven excited, even giving him the eager illusion that he had already set off.",

Steven had no doubt at all that when the weather grew cool, and as the train approached a certain station, Steven would experience a special kind of happiness in the carriage.\n[1897-05-01 22:20:18] Home in Paris | I thought about the train, which in Steven's mind always evoked the same cityscapes, framed by the light of afternoons spent traveling through them, yet Steven seemed to feel that this train was different from any other.\n[1897-05-01 22:20:23] Home in Paris | I thought that, just as people often do with someone they have never met but like to imagine they have gained his friendship, Steven finally endowed a golden-haired artist traveler with a specific, unchanging face.\n[1897-05-01 22:20:28] Home in Paris | I thought he might have taken Steven on his journey, and Steven might have said goodbye to him at the foot of the Saint-Lô Cathedral, after which he would have gone off towards the setting sun.\n[1897-05-01 22:20:33] In my home in Paris | I knew that Steven's grandmother had found it very difficult to decide to go to Riverside, so she wouldn't want the trip to be in vain; therefore, she intended to spend twenty-four hours staying at the home of a friend.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:02] Home in Paris | I saw Steven set out again that same evening from the man's house. I knew I should not bother them, and also so that I could visit the Sainte-Chapelle the next day.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:07] In my home in Paris | I knew the Stevenes had already found out that the church was quite a long way from Riverside, and by the time they got there, they might not have enough time to reach the beach for Steven's seawater treatment.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:12] At my home in Paris | I thought of the wonderful events in Steven's trip, scheduled before the cruel first night, and this thought might make Steven feel a bit better.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:17] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought of that cruel first night when Steven would enter a new dwelling and agree to live there.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:22] At My Home in Paris | I know, but first I had to leave the original residence. Steven and Robert were scheduled to arrive in Saint-Lazare on the same day.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:27] In my home in Paris | I knew she had already taken all necessary measures, or at least pretended to have done so, and that after sending the Stevenes to the station, she would go directly to Saint-Cloud without needing to return to their own home.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:32] At my home in Paris | I thought she was afraid that Steven wouldn't go to Riverside, but instead would go home with her.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:37] Home in Paris | I saw that she had many things to do in the newly rented house, and she used the excuse of having little time to decide not to stay with Steven until the train departed. I thought that it was to spare Steven this cruel farewell.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:42] Station | I saw her hiding among the comings and goings, the preparations here and there, before the train started moving.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:47] Station | I thought that the separation could no longer be avoided, and because my entire energy was focused on that helpless yet supremely noble moment of clarity, the separation suddenly became unbearable.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:52] Station | I realized that for the first time in his life, Steven felt that Steven could live another life without Robert, not for Robert's sake, but simply as a different existence.\n[1897-05-02 00:41:57] Station | I thought about how she was about to go live with James. Perhaps she found Steven unhealthy, overly sensitive, and that he was making James's life more complicated and gloomy.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:02] Station | I thought about how this parting made Steven even sadder, because Steven was thinking to himself: perhaps, for Steven's Robert, this was the result of Steven's constant sorrow.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:07] Station | I thought she had never told Steven how Steven himself kept hurting her, but after all that had happened, she realized they could never go on vacation together again.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:12] Station | I thought it might also be her first attempt at living another kind of life. As James and she grew older, she would begin, for the sake of the future, to willingly accept this other life.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:17] Station | I thought that this was the difference compared to before: Steven saw her less; she had become almost a stranger to Steven; she had become a woman seen returning alone to a house, and Steven was not in that house; she asked the concierge if there was any letter from Steven.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:22] Station | I thought of such a situation, which had never appeared even in Steven's nightmares.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:27] Station | I saw the station employee trying to take Steven's suitcase, and Steven could hardly speak.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:32] Station | I saw Steven's mother, Robert, trying her most effective method to comfort Steven. I realized that it was no use pretending not to see her sorrow over Steven, so I gently made a joke about it.\n[1897-05-02 00:42:37] Station | \"I heard myself say, 'Well, if the Sainte-Chapelle knew someone was coming to see it with such a gloomy face, what would it say? Was that what Ruskin meant by an enthusiastic traveler? Besides, whether you can adapt to the environment, Steven will know. Even from afar, Steven will remain with his little wolf. You'll get a letter from Robert tomorrow.'\"\n[1897-05-02 00:42:42] Station | \"I heard 'daughter,' David said, 'Steven looks just like Madame de Sévigny, never taking a map out of his hands, not for a moment.'\"\n[1897-05-02 01:57:24] Station | I saw, and then Robert tried again to cheer Steven up; she asked Steven what dish he wanted for dinner.\n[1897-05-02 01:57:29] Station | I saw her bowing to Françoise in admiration, praising her for altering a hat and a coat so completely that they were unrecognizable.\n[1897-05-02 01:57:39] Station | I knew that she had once felt repulsed by the sight of this hat, new and worn on Aunt Steven's head, and by this coat, new and worn on Aunt Steven's body.\n[1897-05-02 01:57:59] Station | I knew there was a large bird on top of the hat, and the coat was covered with ugly patterns and dark, glossy spots.\n[1897-05-02 01:58:19] Station | I saw that the overcoat could no longer be worn. Françoise had it turned inside out, revealing a very nice solid-colored lining. I knew about the big bird, which had been broken and long since thrown away.\n[1897-05-02 01:58:29] Station | I thought of a folk song that spoke of the most artistically conscious artists who, with great effort, adorned the façades of peasant houses with the most delicate decorations, so that a white or pale yellow rose would bloom exactly where it belonged on the roof of the house. Sometimes, when you come across something so refined, it really moves you.\n[1897-05-02 01:58:34] Station | I thought of situations like this, the velvet knots, the eggshell-shaped ribbons, those things that would delight one in a portrait by Matthew or Whistler. Françoise, with her impeccable and simple sense of beauty, had sewn these elements onto the hat, making it truly charming.\n[1897-05-02 01:58:39] Station | I realize I have to go back to the beginning, for humility and integrity often endowed this elderly maid with a noble expression.\n[1897-05-02 01:58:54] Station | I knew she was a reserved woman without mean feelings; she understood the importance of \"not overstepping propriety and preserving face.\" For this outing, she wore clothes that others no longer wore but had given to her, so that she could sit among the Stevenes with fitting dignity and without appearing to force their attention.\n[1897-05-02 01:59:14] Station | I saw Steven seeing Françoise in a cherry-red, old coat, her fur collar not stiffly fluffed with hair.\n[1897-05-02 01:59:29] Station | I thought of her, and she made me think of a certain image of Anne de Bretagne as drawn by an older master in \"The Hours.\"\n[1897-05-02 01:59:34] Station | I thought how everything was so neatly arranged in those images, how the emotion of the entire scene was distributed so evenly among its various parts, to the point that the elaborate and outdated special costumes, just like the eyes, lips, and hands, also expressed a solemnpiety.\n[1897-05-02 01:59:39] Station | I thought about Françoise, and yet I couldn't speak of ideas. She knew nothing, which meant that knowing nothing equaled not understanding anything, except for a few rare truths that she could grasp directly from within.\n[1897-05-02 01:59:44] Station | I saw that before her clear gaze, before the delicate lines of her nose and lips, before all these evidence, people would feel flustered, just as one would in the presence of a dog's wise and kind look. I thought that the vast world of thought did not exist for her.\n[1897-05-02 01:59:49] Station | I thought, but people clearly knew that this dog was completely ignorant of the whole range of human thoughts. How strange it was that people with so much culture and education should lack these evidences!\n[1897-05-02 01:59:54] Station | I thought that if there was, it would mean supreme excellence, a noble manifestation of outstanding virtue.\n[1897-05-02 01:59:59] Station | I thought about whether people could really ponder such a question: among the lower-ranking brothers, especially among peasants, are there people who are like the upper class among the simple-minded, more precisely, people who, through an unjust fate, are destined to live among the simple-minded, deprived of knowledge, yet who are more naturally, more by nature, close to the outstanding individuals like most educated people?\n[1897-05-02 02:00:04] Station | I thought of these people as members of the Jesus family, scattered, lost, and deprived of their reason, just as the relatives of the most wise class still remained in childhood. For them, to have talent was only a matter of lacking knowledge.\n[1897-05-02 02:00:09] Station | I saw that Steven saw the undeniable glow radiating from their eyes. I thought, but this light was not directed at anything.\n[1897-05-02 02:00:14] Station | I saw Robert seeing Steven struggling to hold back his tears, and she said to Steven. I heard: \"Regulus is used to big scenes... Besides, it's not good for Robert. Let's quote Madame de Sévigné like David does: 'Steven will have to use all his courage, and you don't have any.'\"\n[1897-05-02 02:00:19] Station | I recalled how deep affection for others could ease selfish pain, and I tried my best to make Steven happy. I told Steven that she thought her trip to Saint-Cloud would go smoothly, that she was very satisfied with the hired carriage she had arranged, and that the coachman was polite and the carriage comfortable.\n[1897-05-02 02:00:29] Station | I saw and heard these trivial things, and Steven forced a smile, nodding with an expression of agreement and satisfaction. I thought that these things would only make Steven imagine Robert's departure more vividly. Steven watched her anxiously, as if she had already separated from him.\n[1897-05-02 02:00:34] Station | I saw her wearing the round straw hat she had bought for going to the countryside, and she was wearing a thin long dress. She had put it on because she had to travel a long distance in the heat.\n[1897-05-02 02:00:49] Station | I thought, but she had already changed, she now belonged to Monte Carlo, to the villa in Saint-Clou. And Steven would never see her in that villa.\n[1897-05-02 02:00:54] Station | I knew that to avoid the possibility of Steven having an attack during the journey, the doctor had advised Steven to drink a little more beer or brandy when departing, in order to be in what he called a \"euphoric\" state, in which the nervous system was temporarily less fragile.\n[1897-05-02 02:01:14] Station | I wondered whether I should follow the doctor's advice, and Steven was still undecided. But Steven at least hoped that once he made up his mind to do so, his grandmother would acknowledge that Steven had the right and the sense to make such a decision himself.\n[1897-05-02 02:01:19] Station | I saw that when Steven talked about it, it seemed that Steven's hesitation was only about where he was going to drink—whether the cold buffet or the bar car.\n[1897-05-02 02:01:29] Station | I saw Steven seeing the look of reproach, even complete indifference, on David's face. I thought of that expression, and suddenly Steven was determined to go drinking.\n[1897-05-02 02:01:34] Station | I saw Steven shouting. I thought that since the announcement of non-objection had not been made, proving that Steven was free made this action indispensable.\n[1897-05-02 02:01:39] Station | I heard, \"What? You know how sick Steven is! You know what the doctor said to Steven! And yet you're advising him like this!\"\n[1897-05-02 02:01:44] Station | I saw David, after Steven had finished explaining his illness to her, look so guilty and kind as she replied to Steven. I heard, \"Then go buy some beer or baijiu, since it will do you good.\"\n[1897-05-02 02:01:49] Station | I saw Steven immediately throw himself into her arms, covering her face with kisses.",

    "text": "[1897-05-02 06:26:05] Bar Car | I saw Steven go to the bar car and drink too much. I thought that was because Steven felt that if he didn't do so, his illness would flare up violently, and that would be the most painful thing for her.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:10] Train compartment | I arrived at the first stop, and Steven got back on the train to his own compartment. Steven told David how happy he was to be going to Riverside, and how he felt everything would go smoothly. Steven felt deep inside that he would soon get used to being away from Robert.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:15] Train compartment | I saw Steven say that the train was very comfortable, and the bartender and his staff were so warm and hospitable that Steven would really like to travel this route often, just to have the chance to meet them again.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:20] Train compartment | I saw that Steven's grandmother did not show the same excitement as Steven for all these good news.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:25] Train compartment | I saw her deliberately avoiding Steven's gaze as she answered Steven, and then turned her eyes toward the window. I heard, \"You probably should try to get some sleep.\"\n[1897-05-02 06:26:30] Train Carriage | I saw that the Stevenes had drawn their curtains, but the curtains did not cover the entire window frame, so the gentle and languid light that was resting in the clearing of the woods was projected onto the waxed oak of the carriage door and the covers of the seats.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:35] Train compartment | I saw the advertisements hanging too high in the carriage; I couldn't make out the scenery or the name of the place, Steven. I thought (this seemed a far more convincing advertisement for a life integrated with nature than the advertisements hung high up in the train carriages).\n[1897-05-02 06:26:40] Train compartment | I saw David thinking that Steven was asleep, but Steven saw her, through her large-patterned veil, occasionally casting a glance at him, then withdrawing her gaze, only to repeat the process again and again. I thought of it like a person striving to form a habit, making great efforts in difficult exercises.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:45] Train compartment | I saw that Steven began talking to her. I thought, but it seemed that this did not make her happy.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:50] Train Carriage | I thought that, in any case, Steven's own voice gave Steven pleasure, and similarly, the most imperceptible and innermost activities of Steven's body gave Steven pleasure.\n[1897-05-02 06:26:55] Train car | I saw that, so Steven tried to prolong it, letting each rise and fall of his speech linger long on the words. I thought of Steven, how Steven felt each of his own glances actually resting where they fell, and lingering there longer than usual.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:00] Train Carriage | I saw David say something to Steven, and as she spoke, she handed him a book by Madame de Sévigné. I heard, \"Alright, time to rest! If you can't sleep, just read a book!\"\n[1897-05-02 06:27:05] Train compartment | I saw Steven open his book, while she herself was lost in the memoirs of Madame Bovary. I knew that whenever she traveled, she simply had to take along the books of these two female authors. They were her two favorite writers.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:10] Train compartment | At that moment, Steven deliberately kept his head still, and once he assumed a certain posture, he remained in that position. I thought Steven experienced a great deal of pleasure from it.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:15] Train car | I saw Steven holding a book by Madame de Sévigné, not opening it, nor lowering his gaze to look at it. In front of Steven's eyes, there was only the blue curtain.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:20] Train compartment | I thought of Steven staring at the curtain, and it seemed absolutely wonderful. If someone had tried to draw Steven's attention away from it, he would certainly have ignored them.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:25] Train compartment | I thought that Steven seemed to believe the blue of the curtain was not beautiful in itself, but rather because it was lively, and it was causing all the colors that had appeared before Steven's eyes from the moment he was born until he finally drank the wine and it began to take effect to fade away.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:30] Train compartment | I thought that, in comparison to the blue of the curtain, all the other colors were dull and meaningless to Steven.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:35] Train Carriage | I thought of those congenitally blind people who were operated on very late, and who finally saw colors; the dark world in which they had lived must have been just like that.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:40] Train Carriage | I saw an elderly employee come to check Steven's ticket. He was wearing a jacket with shiny silver buttons, which once again fascinated Steven.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:45] Train Carriage | I wanted to ask Steven to sit with us, but he went to another carriage.\n[1897-05-02 06:27:50] Train compartment | I thought, and so Steven, with a sense of nostalgia, thought about the lives of railway workers, who spent all their time on the railway, and probably saw this aging employee every day!\n[1897-05-02 06:27:55] Train car | I saw the blue curtain staring, and felt the pleasure that came from Steven's mouth half-opened, and its intensity finally began to subside.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:00] Train Carriage | I saw Steven trying to move. Steven shifted a bit. Steven opened the book that David had given him, and was able to fix his attention on the pages he had selected here and there.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:05] Train Carriage | I thought of Steven, reading while feeling increasing admiration for the Marquise de Sévigné.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:10] Train Car | I thought to myself that one must never be deceived by superficial characteristics, which are related to the era and salon life.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:15] Train Carriage | I thought that it was precisely these kinds of things that made some people believe that by saying things like \"Just call him Steven, Steven the dear,\" or \"Steven finds this count very amusing,\" or \"Turning over cut hay is the most beautiful thing in the world,\" they were forming their own image of Sévigné.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:20] Train compartment | I knew there was already the example of Madame de Cimiana, who thought she was very much like her grandmother because she had written things like \"Mr. de Labris is in excellent health, sir, and upon hearing of his death, he is completely able to bear it.\"\n[1897-05-02 06:28:25] Train car | I know that Steven's grandmother approached Madame de Sévigné through the inner qualities, through the author's love for his family and his love for nature. I thought of how she had taught Steven to appreciate the true beauty of Madame de Sévigné, which had nothing to do with the examples mentioned above.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:30] Train Car | I knew that Steven was about to meet a painter named George in Riverside, and that this encounter would have a profound influence on Steven's sense of beauty.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:35] Train compartment | I thought that Madame de Sévigné and this painter belonged to the same family of great artists, so the beauty in her work left a deeper impression on Steven shortly after.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:40] Train Carriage | I thought of Steven in Riverside, realizing that the way she showed things to Steven and his friends was the same as George's: according to the order in which Steven and his friends perceived them, not by first explaining their causes.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:45] Train compartment | I saw that afternoon, in that compartment, Steven reading the letter again, the one with the moonlight. I thought Steven was over the moon.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:50] Train compartment | I knew Steven could not resist such temptation. Steven put on a hat and a brightly colored shirt, though it was not really necessary. Steven arrived at the tennis court, where the air was very warm, just like in Steven's bedroom.\n[1897-05-02 06:28:55] Train Carriage | I knew that Steven saw countless strange things: monks in white and black robes, nuns in gray and white habits, scattered undergarments, men standing straight and hiding behind trees...\n[1897-05-02 06:29:00] Train compartment | I thought this must be the Dostoevsky side of the Marquise de Sévigné, as Steven would later call it (wasn't her way of describing landscapes and characters exactly the same as his?).",

    "text": "[1897-05-02 06:29:05] Girlfriend's house/train station | I saw Steven take David to her girlfriend's house, and Steven stayed there for several hours.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:10] Train compartment | I saw him at night, Steven once again alone on the train. I thought at least Steven didn't find the evening oppressive, because Steven didn't have to spend the night in a prison like a hotel room, and the drowsy look of that hotel room probably would have kept Steven wide awake.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:15] Train compartment | I saw Steven, who was feeling the calming movements of the train surrounding him, their sounds like a lullaby that was putting Steven to sleep. I thought of Steven combining this sound, like the bell of the church in Sunrise, with one rhythm at one moment and another at another.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:20] Train compartment | I thought of this sound, which rendered Steven's insomniac centrifugal force powerless, exerting a counterpressure on his insomnia and keeping Steven in balance.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:25] Train compartment | I saw Steven motionless. I thought of that fresh impression, which, like a powerful force guarding the peace found in nature and life, gave Steven the same feeling of being at rest. It was as though Steven had, for a moment, transformed into some kind of fish sleeping peacefully in the sea, or into a bird of prey lying on the sole support of a storm.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:30] Train compartment | I know that just like boiled eggs, illustrated newspapers, playing cards, and a river in which the boat is desperately trying to move forward but isn't, sunrise is also a companion of a long-distance train journey. I thought of Steven, who was counting the thoughts that had filled his mind just a few minutes before, in order to realize whether Steven had been asleep a moment ago.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:35] Train compartment | What I saw was, through the windowpane, a small patch of dark woods above which Steven saw a few clouds with indented edges, their fuzzy borders tinged with rose color; fixed in shape, lifeless, never to change again, like the rose-colored feathers on a bird's wing.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:40] Train Carriage | I thought so, but Steven felt the opposite: this color was neither lifeless nor arbitrary, but essential and full of vigorous life.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:45] Train compartment | I saw Steven pressing his eyes against the glass, trying to see more clearly. I saw that, behind the colors, light was gathering, piling up, and the colors grew deeper and deeper until the sky turned a deep pink. I thought that because Steven felt it was closely related to the profound existence of nature.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:50] Train Car | I saw that the direction of the railway had changed, and the train turned the bend. I saw the morning scene within the window frame replaced by a village wrapped in night, its rooftops pale moon-white, and the dirty laundry pool looked like an opaque mother-of-pearl in the night.\n[1897-05-02 06:29:55] Train compartment | I saw Steven again looking from the opposite window, but this time it was red. I thought of Steven, who was grieving the loss of that rosy sky.\n[1897-05-02 06:30:00] Train compartment | I saw the railway make its second bend, and this sky once again abandoned the window opposite me. As a result, Steven spent his time running from one window to the other, trying to connect the beautiful, red, fickle fragments of this morning in a continuous stream.\n[1897-05-02 21:40:07] Train compartment / Mountain station | I saw the landscape become more undulating and steep, and the train had stopped at a small station between two mountains, deep in the valley, on the bank of a rapid stream. All I could see was a small house belonging to the gatekeeper, which was sunk into the water, and the river flowed right beneath the window.\n[1897-05-02 21:52:51] Mountain-side station | I saw Steven see her coming out of the little house, carrying a jar of milk, walking along the path illuminated by the rising sun, toward the station. I thought that if a person could be the product of the land, then certainly a village girl was even more so, and this tall girl was probably what Steven had in mind.\n[1897-05-02 21:52:56] Mountain-side Station | I saw her walking along the carriage, selling milk coffee to a few passengers who had already woken up. I saw Steven seeing the morning light turn her face red, her face more vivid than the pink sky.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:06] Mountain-side station | I thought of facing her, and Steven once again felt the desire for life. Whenever Steven and others once more became aware of beauty and happiness, this desire for life would once again arise within them.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:11] Mountain-side station | I thought of this beautiful girl, and immediately Steven tasted a certain kind of happiness (the only one, always unique, which Steven could only taste in this form), a happiness that might be realized by living beside her.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:16] Mountain-side station | I thought of Steven, whose entire existence was beneficial to the milkmaid, the Steven who longed for intense pleasures and stood opposite her. On this morning of the journey, Steven's old habits of living were interrupted; the change in time and place forced all his abilities to emerge.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:21] Mountain-side Station | I thought that if Steven could spend hour after hour of his life with her, accompanying her all the way to the rapids, to the cows, to the train, always by her side, feeling that she understood Steven and had a place for Steven in her heart, then Steven would find life so sweet!\n[1897-05-02 21:53:26] Mountain-side small station | I saw Steven waving to her, telling her to bring him some milk coffee, and Steven was calling her. I thought Steven needed her to notice him, but she didn't see Steven.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:31] Mountain-side Station | I saw that on her tall figure, her face was so pink and shining with gold, as if others were looking at her through the colored glass windows illuminated by lights.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:46] Mountain-side Station | I saw her turn around and walk towards Steven, giving him a sly glance. I saw Steven staring at her face, which seemed to grow wider and wider, like a red sun fixed in place, and Steven could hardly tear his eyes away from her face.\n[1897-05-02 21:53:56] Mountain-side station | I saw it just then, as the conductor closed the door and the train started moving.\n[1897-05-02 21:54:06] Mountain-side station | I saw Steven watching her leave the station and resume the path. I thought that it was already daylight: Steven was moving away from the dawn.\n[1897-05-02 21:54:11] Train Car | I thought of how her happiness with Steven was so perfectly integrated that Steven's desire to see her again first came from a spiritual yearning not to let this excited state entirely fade, not to be permanently separated from the person involved, even if she herself was unaware of it.\n[1897-05-03 00:12:59] Train compartment | I saw the train accelerate forward, and Steven still faintly caught sight of the beautiful girl. I saw her as part of an entirely different life, one that was completely separate from Steven's familiar world, a strip of fabric separating Steven's life from hers.\n[1897-05-03 00:13:09] Train Carriage | I thought about that other life, where things no longer evoked the same feelings. Now stepping out of that life felt like dying.\n[1897-05-03 00:13:14] Train Carriage | I thought of Steven imagining all sorts of plans so that one day Steven could once again take this same train and stop at this same station, for only in this way could Steven barely accept the other life.\n[1897-05-03 01:03:50] Balbec Station | I saw Steven seeing the name Riverside. I saw above a cold restaurant, on the blue alarm, almost in Persian script, white letters.",

    "text": "[1897-05-03 01:16:34] Balbec Land | I saw Steven hurrying through the station and the street leading to it. Steven asked people where the beach was, just to see the church and the sea. I thought that from the expressions on their faces, they seemed to not understand what Steven was asking.\n[1897-05-03 01:16:39] Balbec Land | I know that Steven is currently in the old town of Riverside, Riverside land, which is neither a seaside resort nor a harbor, although the church has a stained-glass window depicting the story of the discovery of this Christ, and the stones used to build the church nave and bell tower were indeed taken from the cliffs battered by the sea.\n[1897-05-03 01:42:02] Outside the Sainte-Chapelle | I thought of Steven's imagined sea, which surged all the way to the stained glass windows, but in reality, the sea was more than five miles away. Steven had always believed that the base of the bell tower received the spray from the sea's countless waves.\n[1897-05-03 01:42:07] Outside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw that, in reality, the clock tower stood in a square, with two tram lines branching off from it. Opposite was a café, its entrance bearing a golden sign that read \"Billiards.\" Behind the clock tower lay a large residential area, whose rooftops had not a single mast among them.\n[1897-05-03 02:07:29] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw Steven, keeping an eye on the café, keeping an eye on the pedestrians he was asking for directions, and also watching the station he needed to return to, as he entered the church. I saw the church merged with everything else, as if by chance, a product of that afternoon.\n[1897-05-03 02:07:39] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw the soft, rounded dome swelling in the sky like a fruit, and the same sunlight that bathed the house's chimneys ripened the delicate, pink and golden skin that melted as soon as it touched my mouth.\n[1897-05-03 02:07:54] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw Steven recognize the statues of the apostles standing in the doorway of the church, lined up on either side of the Virgin, waiting for Steven. I thought that perhaps it was for welcoming Steven, but Steven only wanted to consider the eternal meaning of sculpture.\n[1897-05-03 02:07:59] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw the Virgin's kind and gentle face, her short, flat nose, and hunched back, as if she were walking forward, singing a \"Hallelujah\" from some day long past.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:14] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw that Steven noticed the expressions of these icons were rigid and motionless, just like the expression of a dead person. I saw that their expressions changed only when people were circling around them.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:24] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I thought to myself: This is it, this is the Sainte-Chapelle. Now, it's a real church, a real Virgin, the one and only, right before my eyes: this is far better than before.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:29] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I thought perhaps it wasn't as good as before. Similarly, in Steven's mind, what was far beyond the replica before his eyes was the image of the Virgin towering high in the doorway.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:34] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw Steven, within arm's reach, occupying a place of honor, with a election poster and the head of Steven's walking stick as his rivals. I thought to myself that now, Steven's mind encountered this statue, which had been sculpted a thousand times before, and he was surprised that the statue's surface was merely stone.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:39] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw this place connected to the square, inseparable from the exit of the main street; she could not avoid the eyes of people in the café and the tram office, and her face was illuminated by a hint of the setting sun.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:54] Inside the Sainte-Chapelle | I saw her, like the branch of the credit company's agency, overcome by the strange smell of the pastry shop's kitchen, at the mercy of ordinary people. I thought that, in the end, this long-anticipated immortal work of art had become, for Steven, like a little old stone woman, someone he could measure the height of and count the wrinkles on.\n[1897-05-03 02:08:59] Balbec Station | I saw that time was passing quickly, and it was time to return to the station, where Steven was waiting for David and Françoise to arrive. I thought that Steven's disappointment could only be explained by chance, that it was due to Steven's poor state of mind, to his exhaustion, to his inability to appreciate; Steven tried desperately to comfort himself with these thoughts.\n[1897-05-03 02:09:04] Balbec Land | I thought that, with regard to Riverside, when Steven first entered the city, it was as if he had opened a seam in a name that should have remained sealed.\n[1897-05-03 04:27:37] Balbec Land | I saw here a streetcar, a café, the crowd moving through the square, a branch of the discount bank, all irresistibly pushed by external pressure and atmospheric forces into the inner parts of this place's syllables.\n[1897-05-03 04:53:00] Small Train Carriage | I saw Steven in the local train that was supposed to take the Stevenes to the seaside at Riverside, but only she was there. I knew she had sent Françoise ahead in order to make all the preparations in advance, but she gave Françoise incorrect directions, and as a result, Françoise went the wrong way.\n[1897-05-03 04:53:10] Small train compartment | I saw the carriage filled with the fleeting glow of sunset and the lingering heat of the afternoon. Under the light of the setting sun, Steven saw on his grandmother's entire face how exhausted she was from the heat.\n[1897-05-03 04:53:25] Small train compartment | I saw Steven sit down, and she asked Steven. I heard \"How was Riverside?\"\n[1897-05-03 04:53:30] Small train compartment | I saw her like that, and Steven couldn't even dare to admit to her right away how disappointed Steven was. I thought of how, because of her hope, her smile was so warm and cheerful, and she believed Steven must have felt great joy.\n[1897-05-03 04:53:35] Small train compartment | I thought that, at the very end, when there was still an hour's journey to go, Steven had desperately imagined what the hotel owner in Riverside looked like.\n[1897-05-03 04:53:40] Small train compartment | I knew that on this short stretch of railway, the train stopped now and then at one station after another, but Riverside by the sea never arrived.\n[1897-05-03 04:54:00] Small train compartment | I thought of just the names of these stations (Angers, Margouilliers, Guerreville, Aulnay, Saint-Mars-le-Vieux, Émonville, Maine) and Steven found it utterly incomprehensible.\n[1897-05-03 04:54:05] Small train compartment | I thought of those ugly names made of sand, of the howling winds and empty spaces, and of salt—words that couldn't hold the word \"city\" any more than the word \"flying dove\" could hold the \"flying\" part.\n[1897-05-03 04:54:10] Small train compartment | I saw some small stations perched atop their dunes, looking down on the distant sea, while others lay at the foot of unattractive, deep green little hills, already ready to sleep—the hills, whose shape resembled the long sofa in a hotel room you just walked into.\n[1897-05-03 04:54:25] Small train compartment | I saw some villas down below, and beyond them a tennis court, sometimes a casino. The flag above the casino's entrance fluttered in the cool sea breeze, but the court was empty and filled with an uneasy feeling.\n[1897-05-03 04:54:40] Small train compartment | I saw the tennis players wearing white sunhats, the station master living among his tamarisks and roses, a lady in a flat straw hat who called back her lagging harehound and then returned to her wooden hut, where the lights were already burning.\n[1897-05-03 04:54:55] Small train compartment | I thought of these small stations, with their commonplace and familiar phenomena, cruelly pricking Steven's unfamiliar gaze and his heart that was a stranger to the place.",

    "text": "[1897-05-03 04:55:00] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven and his family enter the grand hall of the Riverside hotel, facing the vast marble-like staircase, while Steven's grandmother was discussing the \"terms\" with the hotel manager. I thought of how she had cared nothing for increasing the hostility and contempt of those strangers—Steven would have to live among them—and how this must have only deepened Steven's suffering!\n[1897-05-03 07:25:52] Balbec Hotel | I saw the manager was a Proustian figure, full of flaws from face to mouth, dressed in a Playboy tuxedo, his eyes flashing with the gaze of a psychologist.\n[1897-05-03 07:26:07] Balbec Hotel | I thought that when the slow train arrived, he usually regarded the wealthy gentleman as a man full of complaints, and the stingy innkeeper as the wealthy gentleman!\n[1897-05-03 07:26:12] Balbec Hotel | I thought about social standing, which was the only thing the manager paid attention to.\n[1897-05-03 07:26:17] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven sitting on a bench, waiting. Steven heard his grandmother speak in an affected way, asking him. I heard, \"Rent... what's the price... Oh! It's too expensive, Steven doesn't have that kind of money!\"\n[1897-05-03 07:26:22] Balbec Hotel | I saw him listening to David without taking off his hat, even whistling, and David didn't get angry.\n[1897-05-03 07:26:32] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven, hearing these words, trying to retreat into the depths of his own mind, striving to wander among ideas that never changed, not allowing anything lively to show on the surface of Steven's body. I thought to myself that I shouldn't feel too bad here.\n[1897-05-03 07:26:37] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven seeing a beautifully dressed woman, the manager bowing to her with great respect, and then being very affectionate with the dog following behind her; a neatly dressed but ridiculous young man, with feathers on his hat, returned to the hotel and asked, \"Has there been a letter for Steven?\" I thought of all these people who regarded climbing those fake marble steps as coming home, and they seemed quite accustomed to it.\n[1897-05-03 07:26:42] Balbec Hotel | I saw that at the same time, some gentlemen who were probably not very skilled in the art of \"reception\" but bore the title of \"Chief Host\" cast upon Steven looks as severe as those of Minos, Aeacus, and Rhadamanthys.\n[1897-05-03 07:26:52] Balbec Hotel | I saw, further on, behind a closed glass door, some people sitting in a reading room.\n[1897-05-03 07:27:07] Balbec Hotel | I thought about how, if Steven's grandmother, disregarding Steven's feelings, had ordered him to go inside, she would have filled Steven with such fear that he would have had to choose, one after another, the various shades of heaven and hell as Dante gave them.\n[1897-05-03 07:27:12] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven confess to David that he was feeling unwell. I had thought that soon, Steven's sense of loneliness would grow even stronger, and Steven felt that perhaps the Stevenes would have to return to Willowbrook very soon.\n[1897-05-03 07:27:17] Balbec Hotel | I saw that she didn't protest, saying she had to go out and buy some things. Whether the Stevenes left or stayed, these things would be useful anyway. I knew (later Steven found out that all these things had been bought for Steven, because everything Steven lacked was present in Françoise);\n[1897-05-03 07:53:20] Street of Balbec | When I saw that David was still away, Steven went for a walk on the street. I saw the street bustling with people, the crowd keeping the avenue as hot as indoors. The barbershop and a pastry shop were still open, and regular customers stood in front of the Duguet-Rouan statue eating ice cream.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:25] Street of Balbec | I thought of the pleasure the statue gave to Steven, which was similar to the pleasure that a patient in the surgeon's waiting room might feel by glimpsing his own image in a magazine.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:30] Street of Balbec | The more afraid Steven was of making David sad, the more he needed her, and Steven had made up his mind to go back and wait for her.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:35] Balbec Hotel | I saw the manager himself come over and press a button: a figure named \"lift,\" which Steven had never encountered before, began to descend toward Steven, moving with the lightness of a domesticated squirrel, both nimble and yet constrained.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:40] Balbec Hotel | I saw him slide down another column, pulling Steven behind him as they rose toward the dome of the commercial palace.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:45] Balbec Hotel | I saw, on each level, the narrow stairway flanked by dim corridors that fanned out like a fan, and a housemaid carrying a long pillow walked through the corridor.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:50] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven in the look she was giving to Steven. I thought of the disgust I felt for Steven, that worthless man.\n[1897-05-03 07:53:55] Balbec Hotel | I saw that each floor's only toilet formed a single row of vertical glass windows, and the light coming through those windows illuminated this unpoetic, half-light, half-dark place in a most mysterious way.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:00] Balbec Hotel | I spoke to the young organist, the artisan of Steven's journey, and the companion who had been captured by Steven, but he kept pulling the stops on his instrument and pushing the pipes. I thought of the endless upward climb, and how it would dispel the deadly anxiety that Steven silently experienced while passing through this mysterious place.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:05] Balbec Hotel | I apologized to him for taking up so much space and causing him so much trouble, and asked whether Steven was hindering his ability to express his artistic talent. I thought that in such places, Steven not only showed curiosity but also confessed to being deeply fond of these renowned masters.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:10] Balbec Hotel | I saw him, but he ignored Steven, perhaps astonished by what Steven had said; or perhaps he was completely absorbed in his own work, thinking about various signals; or may be he was hard of hearing and respected this place; or perhaps he was afraid of danger; or may be he just didn't feel like thinking; or perhaps it was the manager's order.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:15] Hotel room | I thought of a person, no matter how insignificant, and the change in attitude toward Steven before and after he was known to them—there was probably nothing more capable of giving Steven an impression of the outside world.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:20] Hotel Room | I thought of Steven, who was so exhausted his bones felt broken, who had a fever and didn't even have the basic things needed for sleep, otherwise he would have gone to bed already.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:25] Hotel room | I thought that at least Steven would like to lie in bed for a while, but faced with this whole pile of intense feelings, Steven was certainly unable to rest anyway—what was the point?\n[1897-05-03 07:54:30] Hotel Room | I thought about how the unfamiliar things surrounding this body, although forcing it to perceive while maintaining a constant state of alertness and defense, could also keep Steven's sight, hearing, and all his senses in a very restricted and uncomfortable position (even when Steven spread his legs), like the position of Cardinal de La Samuelière in a cage, unable to stand or sit.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:35] Hotel Room | I thought that in the bedroom at Riverside (which was only nominally \"Steven's\" bedroom), Steven felt there was no space at all, as the room was filled with objects that did not know Steven.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:40] Hotel room | I saw Steven cast a wary glance at them. They, in turn, gave Steven a wary look. I thought of them, utterly indifferent to Steven's existence, appearing as if Steven had disturbed their normal way of life.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:45] Hotel room | I saw the clock in the hotel constantly speaking, in a foreign language, words that might have greatly upset Steven, since the large purple curtains listened silently without answering. I thought of that attitude, which is very similar to the way people shrug their shoulders when they see a third party who irritates them.\n[1897-05-03 07:54:50] Hotel room | I saw that the ceiling of the room was very high, and the curtains gave the room almost a sense of history, so much so that one could imagine it had been suitable for the assassination of Gis Samuel, and later for a guide from Cook's Travel Agency leading tourists to visit it. I thought of it, but it was certainly not suitable for Steven's sleep.",

    "text": "[1897-05-03 07:54:55] Hotel Room | I saw several small glass bookcases along the wall, and their presence was a torment to Steven. Especially troubling was the full-length mirror standing across the room, which threw Steven into a state of nervous confusion.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:00] Hotel Room | I realized that if I didn't move it, Steven would feel he could never relax. Steven occasionally looked up at the ceiling. I thought of the platform above the ceiling, the very top of the hotel, which David had specially chosen for Steven.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:05] Hotel room | I smelled the scent of Fairhaven pushing its attack into more hidden places than Steven could see or hear, into places where Steven could sense the characteristics of various smells, into Steven's final stronghold, almost reaching into Steven's very heart. I thought of Steven, who with weary and anxious nose, sniffed incessantly, responding to its attack with this useless, continuous resistance.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:10] Hotel room | I thought of a world where there was no territory, no room, no body—only the constant threat of enemies surrounding Steven from all sides, their heat seeping into his very marrow. Steven was utterly alone, and he truly wanted to die.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:15] Hotel Room | I saw at that moment that David entered. I thought at once, the infinite space opened up to Steven's oppressed and yearning heart.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:20] Hotel Room | I saw her wearing an elegant, finely woven silk house robe. I thought of this ro be as a garment for tending to Steven, as a nurse's uniform, a garment for watching over Steven, her nun's habit.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:25] Hotel room | I thought that Steven knew, and that when Steven was with David, no matter how sorrowful Steven's heart might be, it would be met with a greater compassion. Everything about Steven, his troubles, his desires, would find support with David.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:30] Hotel room | I saw Steven throw himself into David's arms, pressing his lips against her face. I thought that in this way, Steven would be able to enter the broad heart she had opened to Steven.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:35] Hotel Room | After Steven pressed his lips to her cheeks and her forehead like that, Steven remained perfectly still for a long time. I thought of Steven drawing from it such beneficial, nourishing things, with the earnest, fearless greed of a nursing child.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:40] Hotel room | I saw him, Steven, gazing at her broad face again and again with unending fascination. I saw that outline as a beautiful, passionate, yet calm cloud, and I could feel a tender light shining behind it.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:45] Hotel room | I saw Steven, unable to help himself, gently running his hand through her now gray hair, with reverence, care, and tenderness. I thought that perhaps Steven was caressing her kindness.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:50] Hotel room | I saw her, happy in her sorrow that she had spared Steven yet another pain, and I remained still for a while. I thought of Steven's exhausted limbs, that calm and peaceful moment, so sweet.\n[1897-05-03 07:55:55] Hotel room | I saw that a moment later, Steven, seeing her about to help him get to sleep, had started to take off his shoes. Steven made a gesture to stop her and began to undress himself.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:00] Hotel room | I saw Steven's hand already reaching for the first few buttons of the jacket and short boots, and she stopped Steven's hand with a pleading look.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:05] Hotel Room | \"I heard her say, 'Oh, don't be like that,' to Steven, 'it would make David so happy! Especially when you need anything tonight, don't forget to knock on the wall. Steven's bed is right next to yours, and the partition is very thin. After you lie down a bit later, give it a try, see if we can hear each other.\"\n[1897-05-03 07:56:10] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw that, that night, Steven knocked three times.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:15] Balbec Hotel Room | I knew that a week later, when Steven was unwell, for several days Steven would repeat the three knocks every morning because David had to give him his milk early.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:20] Room at Balbec Hotel | I saw that when Steven thought he heard her wake up, he mustered his courage and knocked three times softly, timidly, gently, but in any case clearly. I thought about not letting her wait and being able to fall back asleep immediately after feeding Steven his milk. Steven was worried that if he made a mistake, she would still be asleep and he would disturb her rest. But Steven didn't want her to keep listening intently in case it was Steven calling.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:25] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven hesitate and not dare to knock again. As soon as Steven knocked three times, he immediately heard three more knocks from the other side.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:30] The room at Balbec Hotel | I heard the three knocks, each with a different tone, filled with calm authority, and to make it clearer, they were repeated twice. I thought to myself, \"Don't worry, Steven heard you! He'll come in a moment!\"\n[1897-05-03 07:56:35] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw at once, David arrived, and Steven said to her. I heard \"Steven is really worried that you can't hear Steven's voice, or that you think it's someone next door knocking.\"\n[1897-05-03 07:56:40] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw her smile. \"I heard 'confusing Steven's poor little wolf's tapping with someone else's? How could that be! Even if a thousand people were tapping, David would be able to tell the difference! Do you think there's anyone else in the world so foolish, so excited, so afraid of waking Steven up and yet so afraid that people wouldn't understand what he was trying to say?\"\n[1897-05-03 07:56:45] The room at Balbec Hotel | \"I heard, 'No matter what, once you catch this little mouse, people can immediately recognize it, especially when this little mouse is alone and pitiable, just like Steven's little mouse! Steven has already been hearing it hesitating for a while, it's tossing and turning in bed, trying all sorts of tricks.\"\n[1897-05-03 07:56:50] Room at the Balbec Hotel | I saw her open the blinds halfway. I saw that the sunlight had already taken up residence on the roof of theannex building in front of the hotel, just like the early roofing workers who had started their work early, quietly finishing their tasks so as not to wake the sleeping city, and the city's stillness made him appear even more skillful.\n[1897-05-03 07:56:55] The room at Balbec Hotel | I heard her telling Steven what time it was, how the weather would be, telling Steven there was no need for him to keep walking all the way to the window, saying there was fog over the sea, asking whether the bakery had opened yet, and describing to Steven the sound of the car that had just passed by on the street. I thought of this insignificant act of drawing back the curtain, this negligible, unobserved morning prelude, a small portion of life belonging solely to Steven and one other person.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:00] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw that during the day, when Steven talked about the thick fog at six in the morning, he would cheerfully mention it in front of Françoise or some strangers. I thought the purpose was not to show that Steven had acquired some knowledge, but rather to show the love that Steven alone had received.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:05] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought of this sweet morning moment, beginning with Steven's three knocks and the answering three, like a rhythmic dialogue unfolding like a symphony.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:10] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw tenderness and joy penetrating through the wall, and the wall became a harmonious, immaterial thing, singing like an angel. I thought of the eagerly awaited three knocks, repeated twice.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:15] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought of how, through those three knocks, David conveyed her entire soul and the promise soon to come, with the lightness of an angel's message and the fidelity of musical beauty.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:20] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought about it, but on the night we arrived in Riverside, after David left Steven, Steven became sad again, just as he had been when he left home in Willowbrook.",

    "text": "[1897-05-03 07:57:25] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought of the things that constituted the essence of life as it appeared before Steven's eyes, the things that Steven and his kind, in their spiritual capacity, would assign a future pattern to. But these things were not part of that future pattern, and they always resisted with all their might.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:30] Room at the Balbec Hotel | I thought of Steven's fear of spending the night in an unfamiliar room— a fear that many people also have — perhaps it was simply the most common, vague, functional, and almost unconscious manifestation of the above-mentioned resistance.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:35] Room at Balbec Hotel | The thought that Steven's parents might one day die, that Steven might be forced by life to leave Michael behind, or simply have to settle in a country where he would never again see his friends, often filled Steven with terrible fear, and it was within this deep fear that the resistance took root.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:40] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought of Steven's own death, or of that kind of immortality in his writings which Christopher had promised to people; it was hard for Steven to imagine.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:45] Room at the Balbec Hotel | I thought of Steven, unable to bring his memories, his flaws, his character into that state of living death; these things could not accept the idea of their own non-existence, nor did they want Steven to have a void or an eternity where they had no place.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:50] Location: Paris | I heard, \"You should set out for those wonderful islands in Oceania. Then you will know that you will never return.\" I know that when we were in Willowbrook, one day Steven was feeling particularly unwell, and Matthew said to Steven.\n[1897-05-03 07:57:55] Paris | I thought that at that time, Steven really wanted to answer him: \"Then Steven would never see your daughter again, and Steven would have to live among people and things she had never seen.\"\n[1897-05-03 07:58:00] Location: Paris | I thought, but Steven's reason told Steven: \"If you are no longer troubled by it, what does it matter? When Mr. Matthew told you that you would not return, he meant that you would not want to return; since you don't want to return, that means you will be happy there.\"\n[1897-05-03 07:58:05] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought about how, because Steven's reason knew it, habit--this habit that was now about to take on a serious task, to make Steven fall in love with this unfamiliar residence, with the changed position of the large wardro be mirror, with the altered color of the curtains, with the stopped wall clock--also had the power to turn companions who had not at first been liked into dear friends, to give faces a different shape, to make someone's voice sound more passionate and appealing, and to change the object of one's affections.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:10] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought of nature, of new friendships for certain places and certain people, which is like a net that forgets past friendships.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:15] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought about it, but Steven's reason insisted that Steven could imagine a future life without fear. In that future, Steven would be separated from some people and would forget them.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:20] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought about how this life made a promise of oblivion to Steven's heart, and yet, oblivion would only make despair more frantic, and this seemed to offer some comfort.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:25] Room at the Balbec Hotel | I thought that it wasn't that, once accustomed to separation, Steven's heart would no longer feel the numbing effect of habit, but rather that, up until now, this heart was still in pain.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:30] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought about the fear that one day Steven and his friends would no longer be able to see the people they loved or speak with them, and it was precisely in the face of this prospect that Steven was experiencing the rarest kind of happiness today.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:35] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought that if the Stevenes wanted to, they could add to the pain of this deprivation the even more cruel thing that seemed to be happening to them right now: not feeling this worry as one feels a pain, but rather being indifferent to it. This fear would not fade away, but instead grow stronger.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:40] Room at the Balbec Hotel | I thought that if this were the case, the \"self of Steven\" would change: not only would the charm of Steven's parents, Steven's mistresses, and Steven's various friends no longer exist around Steven, but also Steven's affection for them would be completely uprooted from Steven's heart.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:45] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought that this kind of affection had become an important part of Steven's inner life today. In the future, Stevenes would come to like this life of separation, but today, just thinking about such a life filled them with fear.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:50] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought that if this were the case, it would be the true death of the Stevenes themselves. Death is followed by resurrection, that is true, but this resurrection already exists within a different self of Steven, and the parts of the original self of Steven that were destined to die could not rise to love this different self of Steven.\n[1897-05-03 07:58:55] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought that what now inspired fear, resistance, and rebellion was precisely those parts of the original Steven destined to die--even the weakest ones, such as an inexplicable attachment to the size and atmosphere of a room.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:00] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought that it was necessary to see, this was an implicit, localized, indeed, real way of resisting death, a long, desperate, day by day resistance to that continuous, piecemeal death.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:05] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought of this death creeping into the entire life process of the Stevenes, peeling away piece by piece the Stevenes themselves at every moment. It is precisely on the decay of these things that new cells proliferate.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:10] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought that for someone like Steven, who was by nature hypersensitive, the anxious fear felt by Steven and others under these unfamiliar, towering ceilings was nothing more than a protest from friendship.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:15] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought of that friendship for the familiar, low ceiling which had survived, living on in Steven's heart. Perhaps this friendship would disappear, replaced by another (then, death, and a completely new life would accomplish their double task under the name of \"habit\").\n[1897-05-03 07:59:20] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought about it, but until this friendship died, every night would be painful, and the first night especially. It faced a future that had become real, a future where it no longer had a place, and it rebelled against it.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:25] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw that whenever Steven's gaze could not turn away from the thing that hurt it, he tried to fix it on the unattainable ceiling. Whenever I thought of it, I tormented Steven with weeping cries.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:30] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw a servant come in to wake Steven and bring him hot water.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:35] Balbec Hotel Room | I watched Steven wash and comb his hair, desperately searching through Steven's suitcase for the things Steven needed, but it was in vain. What Steven pulled out from inside were all sorts of random things, none of which were of any use.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:40] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw, from every glass pane of the window and the bookcase, just as one would see the open sea from a ship's porthole, Steven seeing the exposed sea, unobstructed, half in the shadow of his vast territory, bounded by a thin, moving line. I thought that Steven had already thought about the pleasure of breakfast and a walk.\n[1897-05-03 07:59:45] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw my eyes chasing the waves, watching them leap one after another, like athletes jumping on a springboard. I thought, how happy!\n[1897-05-03 07:59:50] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven holding a stiff, starched towel with the hotel's name printed on it, trying to dry himself with it, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get dry.",

    "text": "[1897-05-03 07:59:55] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw Steven occasionally return to the window, taking another look at this dizzying, mountainous circus, and at the waves of sapphire that were polished and translucent, their snow-white peaks. I saw the waves, with a calm ferocity and the look of a lion's frown, letting their slopes collapse and tumble down. The sun once again enhanced the slope with a smile whose face was invisible.\n[1897-05-03 08:00:00] Balbec Hotel Room | After that, every morning Steven stood by the window, just as if he had fallen asleep on a carriage and then rushed to the carriage's window. I thought about whether the mountains that Steven longed for were drawing closer or receding at night.\n[1897-05-03 21:54:03] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw that, here, these hills of the sea, before wildly dancing back to Steven's side, might retreat very far, so that Steven could often only faintly glimpse their first undulations behind a long stretch of sandy plain.\n[1897-05-03 21:54:18] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw the distant, semi-transparent, mist-veiled, bluish glacier, like the deep background of a painting by an early Renaissance Tuscan artist.\n[1897-05-03 21:54:33] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw that sometimes, right next to Steven, the sunlight was laughing on top of these waves, which were a tender green, just like the moist earth and the liquid flow of light that kept the alpine meadows in a fresh green hue (on the mountain, the sunlight spread here and there, like a giant joyfully leaping unevenly down the slope).\n[1897-05-03 21:54:48] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw the beach and the waves carving out this opening in the remainder of the world, so that the sunlight could pass through here and gather here. I thought that from this place, looking in the direction from which the sea came and the direction followed by Steven's eyes, it was the sunlight moving the hills of the sea, the sunlight fixing its position.\n[1897-05-03 21:54:53] The room at Balbec Hotel | I thought that the endless variations of light could also change the position of a place, and could set up new goals before Steven's eyes, arousing in Steven a desire to reach them, a desire that could only be fulfilled through great hardship and long journeys.\n[1897-05-03 21:54:58] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw the morning, the sun coming from behind the hotel, revealing a sunny beach before Steven, extending all the way to the castle at the very edge of the sea.\n[1897-05-03 21:55:13] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw the sun apparently revealing another slope of the castle to Steven. I thought of and encouraged Steven to ride its shining wheel and continue his journey.\n[1897-05-03 21:55:18] Balbec Hotel Room | I thought of this journey as being stationary, yet through the ever-changing scenery that emerged in the fluctuating moments, it was endlessly varied.\n[1897-05-03 21:55:23] Room at Balbec Hotel | From the very first morning, I saw the sun always extending a smiling finger, pointing the blue peaks of the distant sea to Steven. These peaks have no names on any map.\n[1897-05-03 21:55:38] Balbec Hotel Room | I saw the sun wandering freely over the roaring and chaotic surface of the mountain ridges and avalanches, until it grew tired and finally came to Steven's room for shelter. There, it lay lazily on the disordered bed, on the damp washbasin, in the open trunk, taking out its treasures.\n[1897-05-03 21:55:53] The room at Balbec Hotel | I saw that its brilliant glow and the extravagance misplaced in it only deepened the impression of a confused composition.\n[1897-05-04 05:42:37] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | An hour later, in that vast dining room, the Stevenes were having lunch, sprinkling a few drops of golden liquid from the lemon's skin onto two flatfish.\n[1897-05-04 05:42:47] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I watched for a little while, and soon Steven's plate was left with only fish bones. The bones curved gently, like a feather; they made a clear sound, like a zither.\n[1897-05-04 05:43:02] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought it was a pity, at that moment David could not feel the cool, invigorating breeze of the sea; she found it truly cruel.\n[1897-05-04 05:43:07] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw that, although the windows and doors were transparent, they were closed, like a display window, allowing the Stevenes to see the entire beach, yet separating the Stevenes from the beach.\n[1897-05-04 05:43:22] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw the sky completely enter through the windows and doors, so that the deep blue of the sky seemed to be the color of the window itself, and the white clouds seemed to be imperfections on the glass.\n[1897-05-04 05:43:37] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought of Steven, who was certain he was sitting \"on the sea wall,\" or \"in the depths of a lady's drawing room,\" as Baudelaire had said. Steven asked himself whether the \"sunlight that illuminates the sea\" he spoke of was not precisely this sunlight—completely different from the sunset's afterglow, simple and superficial, like a flickering golden streak.\n[1897-05-04 05:43:42] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw it burning the sea like a yellow gem, causing the sea to ferment and turn into a golden, milky substance, like beer; it was covered with foam, like milk. Here and there, large blue shadows occasionally drifted about, as if some god were moving a mirror in the sky, shifting the shadows around for his own amusement.\n[1897-05-04 05:43:57] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw the restaurant in Riverside, bare and filled with green sunlight, like the water in a swimming pool. A few meters away, the high tide of the sea and the blazing sun stood like an impregnable moving fortress of jewels and gold, just as they would before paradise.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:12] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I knew that this restaurant was not only different in appearance from the \"hall\" in Sunrise that faced the opposite houses. In Sunrise, everyone knew the Stevenes, so Steven didn't care about anyone. In the life of sea-bathing, people didn't know their neighbors.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:17] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought that Steven was still quite young and very sensitive, and would never give up the desire to be liked and to possess them. A man from the upper class might feel a more noble indifference toward people dining in a restaurant.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:22] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought that neither he nor the young men and women who passed by the seawall had any sense of carelessness. The thought of not being able to go on an outing with them made Steven very sad.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:27] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought about Steven's grandmother, who despised social formalities and was only concerned with Steven's health. If she were to make a request that they accept Steven as a walking companion, it would be an insult to Steven, and of course, he would feel even worse.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:32] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | No matter whether they returned to some unfamiliar wooden villa or stepped out of it with their tennis rackets toward the court, or rode horses, Steven always watched them with eager curiosity. I thought of the hoofbeats trampling on Steven's heart.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:37] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw Steven in this light, gazing at their every move through the transparent large bay window that let so much light in. I saw that in the dazzling light of the beach, the usual social proportions had changed.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:47] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought so, but according to Steven's grandmother, the bay blocked the wind, which was a drawback. She couldn't stand the idea of Steven losing an hour of the benefits of breathing the sea air.\n[1897-05-04 05:44:52] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw her and secretly opened a window. I saw it all happen at once: not only did the menu fly away, but also the newspapers, veils, and sunhats of everyone having lunch.\n[1897-05-04 05:45:02] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw my David herself, supported by the good winds of heaven, remaining calm and smiling like Saint Brigid, even amidst the outcries.\n[1897-05-04 05:45:12] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I saw these accusations unite the sneering, wind-tousled, angry tourists against the Stevenes. I thought it only added to Steven's sense of loneliness and sorrow.\n[1897-05-04 05:45:17] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I knew quite a few of these tourists, who were composed of prominent figures from the major provinces of France, such as the presiding judge of the Caen court, the chief lawyer of Cherbourg, an important notary from Montreuil, and so on.\n[1897-05-04 05:45:37] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I knew that in those places, they remained scattered all year round, like chess pieces, and every vacation they would gather at this hotel from various points.\n[1897-05-04 05:45:57] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I knew that the clientele of the luxurious hotels in Riverside was usually wealthy and international, but now it had acquired a rather pronounced regional character.\n[1897-05-04 05:46:17] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I knew that they always kept those few rooms at the hotel, forming a small group together with their wives, who dressed like noblewomen. A prominent lawyer and a doctor from Willowbrook also joined this group.\n[1897-05-04 05:46:37] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I heard that on the day they left, these two Willowbrookians said to those people, \"Ah, really, you're lucky not to be sitting on the same train as the Stevenes, so you can get home for dinner!\"\n[1897-05-04 05:46:42] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | \"I heard 'What? You say he's lucky? You live in the capital, Willowbrook, a big city, while Steven lives in that miserable little provincial town with ten thousand people. The latest census was ten thousand and two hundred, that's true. You have two and a half million people, and you're going back to the dazzling social scene of Willowbrook on the asphalt roads. Compared to you, what are Steven's chances?\"\n[1897-05-04 05:46:47] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I thought of them speaking these words with the Willowbrookian rolled \"r,\" not in a sarcastic way, because their provincial sunlight seemed to be able to go to Willowbrook as well.\n[1897-05-04 05:46:52] Balbec Hotel Restaurant | I knew that they had offered the chief judge of Caen a position at the appellate court— but because of their love for their city, or their preference for obscurity, or their desire for prominence, or because they were conservative, or to maintain good relations with their neighbors in the villas, they preferred to stay local. Moreover, several of them did not immediately return to their provincial towns.",

    "text": "[1897-05-04 11:13:39] Balbec Hotel | I saw that in the great universe, the Bay of Riverside was a special little universe, a basket of seasonal fruits, a collection of various dates and successive months arranged in a circle.\n[1897-05-04 11:13:44] Balbec Hotel | I knew the days when Springfield was visible were a sign of storm. Even when the sky over Riverside had already darkened, the sunlight on the roof of Springfield was still visible.\n[1897-05-04 11:13:59] Balbec Hotel | I saw that, not only that, but when the cold had already conquered Riverside, it was certain that on the other side of the coast, there still remained an added two or three months of hot weather.\n[1897-05-04 11:14:14] Balbec Hotel | I saw that among the regular guests at the big hotel, those who had started their holidays later or had longer stays would, as autumn approached and the autumn rains and thick fogs arrived, order their trunks to be loaded onto a boat and taken across the sea to Springfield or Costador to join the summer.\n[1897-05-04 11:14:24] Balbec Hotel | I saw this small group at the Riverside hotel watching each new arrival with wary eyes. Everyone pretended not to be interested in the person, yet they immediately questioned their friends—the head waiter of the hotel's service staff.\n[1897-05-04 11:14:34] Balbec Hotel | I knew that every year it was Hermine who did the season and served them their meals.\n[1897-05-04 11:14:54] Balbec Hotel | I saw the wives of these people and knew that Emma's wife was about to give birth. After dinner, each of them made a baby item, while using the long-handled eyeglasses they held to point at Steven's grandmother and Steven. I knew that because the Stevenes ate cold salad with boiled eggs. It was an ordinary dish, but in the upper class of Alençon, they didn't eat anything like that.\n[1897-05-04 11:15:04] Balbec Hotel | I saw them display a mixture of mockery and contempt toward a Frenchman they called \"Your Majesty.\" I knew this Frenchman actually did claim to be the king of a small island in Oceania, where only a few savages lived. He and his beautiful mistress lived in a guesthouse.\n[1897-05-04 11:15:14] Balbec Hotel | Every time she went for a seawater bath and passed by, the mischievous children would shout. I heard \"Long live the Queen!\" I knew because she threw coins of fifty centimes at them in handfuls.\n[1897-05-04 11:15:19] Balbec Hotel | I saw that the chief judge and the chief prosecutor did not even bother to act as if they had seen her. I thought that if any of their friends looked at her, they would feel obliged to warn him, saying that the woman was merely a factory worker and a prostitute by origin.\n[1897-05-04 11:15:24] Location: Balbec Hotel | \"I heard, 'But someone guaranteed Steven that they were using the royal cabin in Ostend!'\" \"Of course! Twenty francs for the rental! If you like, you can use the same cabin yourself.\"\n[1897-05-04 11:15:29] Balbec Hotel | \"I heard, 'And Steven knew for sure that he had once requested an audience with the king, but the king had someone tell him that the king didn't want to meet this monarch from the puppet theater.' 'Oh, really? That's truly interesting! Some people really...'\"\n[1897-05-04 11:15:34] Location: Balbec Hotel | I felt so distressed when I saw the notary, the chief judge, and the chief lawyer, showing their anger in an elevated tone as the two men, whom they called absurdly dressed marionettes, passed by. I thought it was probably all true, but also because they felt annoyed that they were merely part of the upper bourgeoisie, and they were angry that they didn't even know this king and queen who gave coins so generously.\n[1897-05-04 11:15:39] Balbec Hotel | I saw him, who was more generous than the genuine kings, forced to smile at these two men, yet from a distance he winked knowingly at his old customer as he noted down their order. I thought of their friend, the hotel concierge, who understood it all very well.\n[1897-05-04 11:15:44] Balbec Hotel | I knew a young man they called \"the Handsome Fellow,\" an ornately dressed, pretentious youth, the son of a big industrialist, suffering from tuberculosis and spending money recklessly.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:15] Balbec Hotel | I saw him change into a new suit every day, with a orchid in the buttonhole, and drink champagne at lunch.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:20] Balbec Hotel | I saw him, his face pale and expressionless, a cold smile on his lips, placing large bets at the crystal glass gaming tables in the casino.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:25] Location: Balbec Hotel | I thought that people mistakenly believed that these men were not as \"handsome\" as the young man, and they could not explain that they were actually more \"handsome\" than him.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:30] Balbec Hotel | I saw the notary say to the chief judge, \"He simply couldn't afford to lose such a large sum,\" while the chief judge's wife, according to reliable sources, said that this \"end-of-the-century\" young man had his parents in a real uproar. I thought it might also be a bit due to this irritation.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:35] Balbec Hotel | I saw that on the other hand, the chief lawyer and his friends were mercilessly mocking a wealthy old woman with a noble title, because she carried her entire daily life with her wherever she went.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:40] Balbec Hotel | Every time the notary's wife and the chief judge's wife saw her in the restaurant, they would scrutinize her with long-handled spectacles in a brazen way, as if she were a dish on the table. I thought of the dish, whose name was strange and its appearance suspicious. After systematic observation, I concluded it was not worth considering, adopting an attitude of complete rejection and making a face of disgust, ordering the dish to be taken away.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:45] Balbec Hotel | I thought to myself that undoubtedly, their whole act was meant to show that if they lacked certain things, like some of the privileges of this old woman connected to her, it wasn't that they couldn't have them, but rather that they didn't want to.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:50] Balbec Hotel | I thought that in the end, they themselves would come to believe it wholeheartedly, and thus they would lose all desire and curiosity about a way of life they didn't understand, and have no hope of pleasing people they had just met.\n[1897-05-04 14:56:55] Location: Balbec Hotel | I thought that all this was replaced in these women by affected indifference and feigned happiness. There is a drawback to this, which is that they pretend to be unhappy beneath the guise of satisfaction, and they constantly deceive themselves, and these two things were enough to bring them misfortune.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:00] Balbec Hotel | I thought, perhaps everyone in the hotel acted in the same way, only with different forms. In this way, even if not out of pride, at least out of certain educational principles or habits of thought, they sacrificed the infinitely delightful experience of participating in a completely unfamiliar life.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:05] Balbec Hotel | I thought that obviously, the microcosm in which the old woman lived, isolated from the outside world, had not been poisoned by the bitter and sarcastic remarks of thenotary's wife and the chief judge's wife and their clique.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:10] Balbec Hotel | I thought the opposite: this small universe exuded an elegant but somewhat old-fashioned fragrance, a scent that was equally artificial. After all, if an old woman could attract and maintain (for which she herself had to keep renewing) the mysterious favor of new acquaintances, she would surely derive infinite pleasure from it.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:15] Balbec Hotel | I thought that now she only associated with people from her own little universe, always considering this small universe to be the essence of the greater one, and was largely unaware of, or simply ignored, any contempt for others. Such a life was pleasant, but it lacked the kind of infinite pleasure mentioned earlier.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:20] Balbec Hotel | I thought that if she arrived quietly at the Riverside Hotel, dressed in her black woolen dress and wearing her outdated hat, she would surely provoke a sneer from some dissolute young man or an important person.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:25] Balbec Hotel | I thought that the young aristocrat might be dancing with a swaying motion, all the while squeezing out the words \"poor old hag!\" between his teeth.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:30] Balbec Hotel | I saw the important person, like a chief judge, with a round face of healthy redness and the clever, intelligent eyes she liked, framed by a circle of white sideburns. The long-handled glasses, whose lenses were always close to his eyes, signaled the arrival of this strange and peculiar figure.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:35] Balbec Hotel | I thought about how people know that this minute is fleeting, yet it is also terrifying—like plunging headlong into water.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:40] Balbec Hotel | I saw that the old woman had sent a servant ahead to the hotel to inform them about her personality and habits.",

I thought perhaps it was because of an unconscious fear of this moment.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:50] Balbec Hotel | I saw that in the room, the curtains I had installed replaced the original ones that had hung by the window, along with the screen and the photographs. They set up a kind of lattice between her and the outside world she should have been adapting to, arranging her own habits so well that it seemed not she was traveling, but her home itself.\n[1897-05-04 14:57:55] Balbec Hotel | I saw that she had arranged her own servant between herself and the hotel staff and suppliers.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:00] Balbec Hotel | I saw that after that, it would be her servant who would make contact with the new people here, while maintaining the usual atmosphere around her mistress.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:05] Balbec Hotel | I saw that she also voiced her prejudices between herself and the people taking sea baths, without worrying about offending some individuals, people who her girlfriends wouldn't even receive.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:10] Balbec Hotel | I saw that through communication with my girlfriend, through memory, through inner awareness of my own status, proper conduct, and good manners, she continued to live in her own world.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:15] Location: Balbec Hotel | Every day, I saw her descend in an open carriage for a walk, with her maid following closely behind carrying her clothes, and a servant ahead of her like a sentry at an embassy gate.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:20] Balbec Hotel | I know that at the embassyin front of, where the flag of my own country is displayed, the sentry stands on foreign soil, ensuring the embassy's special extraterritorial rights.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:25] Balbec Hotel | The day Steven arrived, the old woman didn't leave her room in the afternoon, and Steven didn't see her shadow in the dining room.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:30] Balbec Hotel | I saw that because the Stevenes were new arrivals, the hotel manager, during lunchtime, placed them under his protection, leading them to the dining room, just as an officer would lead new recruits to a noncom tailor to have their uniforms issued.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:35] Balbec Hotel | I saw that, but a little while later, Steven encountered Monsieur de St. Léger and his daughter, Mademoiselle de St. Léger, in the dining room. I knew they belonged to an obscure and very ancient Breton family.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:40] Balbec Hotel | I saw the manager, who thought they wouldn't be back until evening, and he gave their table to Steven and his group.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:45] Balbec Hotel | I knew that the father and daughter had come to Riverside specifically to meet the castle owner, a person they knew, who lived nearby. Other than accepting outside invitations and returning them, they spent only the bare minimum of time in the hotel restaurant.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:50] Balbec Hotel | I thought of their arrogance, which left them with not the slightest trace of human kindness or interest in the strangers sitting around them.\n[1897-05-04 14:58:55] Balbec Hotel | I saw that, among these people, Monsieur de St. Léger always maintained an expression of icy indifference, sharp as lightning, remote and unapproachable, brutal, irritable, and malicious.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:00] Balbec Hotel | I thought about being in the dining car of a train, among strangers who would never meet again, and how my relationship with these people was nothing more than defending my cold chicken and this corner of the compartment from their intrusion. That was all such expressions signified.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:05] Balbec Hotel | I saw the Stevenes just starting their lunch when someone came to tell them, as instructed by Monsieur de St. Léger, to get up.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:10] Balbec Hotel | I saw the gentleman had just arrived and showed no sign of apology to the Stevenes. He loudly called the attention of the hotel staff manager, demanding that such mistakes not happen again. He was unhappy because a \"stranger\" had taken his table.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:15] Balbec Hotel | I knew a certain actress (famous for her lavish clothes, quick wit, and a complete set of German porcelain, far more than the few roles she played at the Odéon Theatre), and her lover (a very wealthy young man, for whom she had cultivated her tastes), as well as two men who were very prominent in aristocratic circles. The four of them formed their own little group, never going out without each other.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:20] Balbec Hotel | I saw that lunch in Riverside was very late; everyone had already finished eating when they arrived, and they spent the whole day playing cards in their parlor.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:25] Balbec Hotel | I thought that the emotions prompting them to act this way were naturally free of any malice, merely reflecting their taste for certain humorous ways of speaking and their refined palate for certain delicacies.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:30] Balbec Hotel | I thought that this kind of taste and enjoyment made them find pleasure in not having to live together, not having to eat together. If they had to live with someone who didn't share this enjoyment, they would not be able to stand it.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:35] Balbec Hotel | I thought that even when facing a table with food already laid out or a gambling table, each of them still needed to know whether the knowledge in the mind of the guest or partner sitting across from them, and their shared standard for distinguishing right from wrong, would be set aside in any matter.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:40] Location: Balbec Hotel | I thought of how many Willowbrookian homes were decorated with cheap imitations of so-called \"medieval\" or \"Renaissance\" pieces, and how certain knowledge enables one to distinguish between the genuine and the fake.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:45] Balbec Hotel | I thought that at such moments, this kind of special life that these friends longed to be immersed in could only be expressed through rare and comical exclamations made while silently eating or playing cards, or through the attractive new dress worn by a young actress for lunch or poker.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:50] Balbec Hotel | I thought that this life, which envelops them with the habits they understand thoroughly, would be enough to protect them from the secrets of the surrounding life.\n[1897-05-04 14:59:55] Balbec Hotel | I saw the long afternoon, the sea before them. I thought of it as nothing more than a soft-colored oil painting hanging on the wall of a wealthy bachelor's small parlor.\n[1897-05-04 15:00:00] Balbec Hotel | I saw a man playing cards, and during the breaks between his turns, he looked up at the sea just once, to see if there was any sign of fine weather or what time it was, and to remind others that it was time for afternoon tea.\n[1897-05-05 00:41:42] Location: Balbec Hotel | I saw that they didn't have dinner at the hotel in the evening.\n[1897-05-05 00:41:47] Location: Balbec Hotel | I saw that in the hotel, the electricity made the restaurant shine brightly, and the restaurant seemed to have become a vast and beautiful fishbowl.\n[1897-05-05 00:41:52] Location: Balbec Hotel | I saw the families of Riverside's workers, fishermen, and townspeople hiding in the shadows. I see you can't see them, but they crowd against the glass walls of the fishbowl, wanting to catch a distant glimpse of these people's luxurious life in the shimmering gold.\n[1897-05-05 00:41:57] Balbec Hotel | I thought that for people who are poor, their lives are indeed as incomprehensible as those of strange fish and mollusks.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:02] Balbec Hotel | I wondered whether the glass walls could forever protect the exquisite feast of animals, and whether the faceless people who silently gazed longingly at night would not come to steal this rare creature and eat it—it was a major social issue.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:07] Balbec Hotel | I thought that among the crowd of people standing there staring in the dark, who couldn't see clearly, perhaps there was some writer, some ichthyologist of humanity, who would watch the old devil females open their jaws to seize a piece of food and then close them again, and then classify these old devils according to their breed, nature, and acquired characteristics for their own amusement!\n[1897-05-05 00:42:12] Balbec Hotel | I saw an old Serbian woman whose mouth extended like the mouth of a large sea fish. I thought of her, who had lived all her life in the fresh waters of Saint-Germain.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:17] Location: Balbec Hotel | I saw that it was precisely this acquired characteristic that made her eat cold dishes. I thought of myself as someone from the La Roche-Foucault family.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:22] The restaurant of the big hotel | I saw Steven looking at the large dining room of the big hotel, which was usually full. I thought that for Steven, eating here was always a frightening experience.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:27] The Grand Hotel Restaurant | I knew that this situation was especially true when the hotel's owner—or the general manager selected by the partnership company, which Steven wasn't exactly sure about—came to stay for a few days.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:32] The restaurant of the big hotel | I knew this man was not the owner of this luxurious hotel, but rather the proprietor of seven or eight hotels scattered throughout France, and he moved between them, staying for a week at each from time to time.\n[1897-05-05 00:42:37] The restaurant of the big hotel | At that moment, just as dinner began, every evening at the restaurant entrance, Steven would appear, a little old man with white hair, a red nose, expressionless, neatly dressed, unusual.",

As he passed by, he nodded to Steven, clearly to show that Steven was his customer, but in a very cold manner.\n[1897-05-05 01:53:38] The restaurant of the big hotel | I thought of Steven's inability to recognize the reason for this coldness—whether it was the restraint of someone who could not forget his own identity, or a contempt for an unimportant customer.\n[1897-05-05 01:53:43] The Restaurant of the Large Hotel | I saw that, in turn, facing those very important guests, Steven also showed the same coldness when the director bowed, but he bent lower, more respectfully, lowering his eyes as if standing before his father's corpse at a funeral or before the Holy Body.\n[1897-05-05 01:53:53] The Restaurant of the Large Hotel | I saw that, besides this cold and rare salute, he didn't move a muscle. I thought that he seemed to demonstrate that his prominent, sparkling eyes could see everything and solve any problem, ensuring both the finest details and overall harmony at the \"dinner at the big hotel.\"\n[1897-05-05 01:53:58] The restaurant of the big hotel | I thought that he obviously felt himself superior to the director, superior to the orchestra conductor, a true supreme commander.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:03] The Grand Hotel Restaurant | I thought that by raising my gaze to its highest degree, everything would be ready, and any mistake made would not lead to total defeat.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:08] The Restaurant of the Large Hotel | I saw that in order to take on his responsibility, he didn't even make any gestures, nor did he blink an eye. I saw Steven, his eyes, so concentrated, had almost turned to stone.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:18] The Grand Hotel Restaurant | I thought that his eyes saw everything, and guided everything; Steven felt that even Steven's movement of the spoon was not hidden from his eyes.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:23] The restaurant of the big hotel | I saw that as soon as he finished his soup, he slipped away. I thought of it, but the inspection he had just given left Steven with no appetite for the entire dinner.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:28] The Restaurant of the Large Hotel | I knew his appetite was excellent, because he dined in the restaurant with everyone else at the same time, just like an ordinary person.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:48] The Restaurant of the Large Hotel | I saw the other manager, the usual one, standing beside him and talking to him. I saw that everyone could see that the only thing special about his table was that he ate at it.\n[1897-05-05 01:54:58] The Restaurant of the Large Hotel | I saw that because this manager was subordinate to the general manager, he was trying very hard to flatter him. I thought of him and was terrified of the general manager.\n[1897-05-05 01:55:03] The restaurant of the big hotel | I saw the general manager disappear into the crowd at that moment, making every effort not to be noticed. I thought of Steven's fear at lunchtime, which had lessened somewhat, like a general sitting in a restaurant where there are also soldiers, and he tries to appear indifferent to them.\n[1897-05-05 01:55:08] The restaurant of the big hotel | I saw that, despite everything, Steven was surrounded by uniformed servants. I thought of the concierge announcing to Steven, \"He's leaving tomorrow morning for Dinard. From there, he'll go to Biarritz, then to Cannes,\" and at that moment, Steven finally felt a bit more at ease.\n[1897-05-05 01:55:13] Hotel | I knew that Steven had no acquaintances in the hotel, while Françoise had made many friends. It occurred to me that Steven's life here was not only pitiful but also very uncomfortable.\n[1897-05-05 01:55:18] Hotel | I thought that, apparently, the people she associated with should have made things easier for Steven, but in reality it was the opposite.\n[1897-05-05 05:54:12] Hotel | I knew that although the working-class people found it difficult to make Françoise treat them as regulars, this could only be achieved under certain conditions of extreme politeness.\n[1897-05-05 05:54:32] Hotel | I knew that once they reached such a position, their presence would be the only thing that remained in Françoise's heart. I thought her old experience had taught her that she could be completely unreserved with her master's friends.\n[1897-05-05 05:54:37] Hotel | I saw that if she had something important to do, she could send away a lady who had come to visit Steven's grandmother. I know, but with regard to her own acquaintances, that is, those ordinary people who are rarely accepted into her rare and precious friendship, her behavior was guided by the most meticulous, thorough, and absolute diplomatic etiquette.\n[1897-05-05 05:54:47] Hotel | I knew that Françoise had gotten to know the head waiter in charge of beverages, and also a little maid who made long dresses for a Belgian lady.\n[1897-05-05 05:55:07] Hotel | After she met them, Françoise no longer rushed upstairs right after lunch to prepare various things for Steven's grandmother, but instead did so an hour later.\n[1897-05-05 05:55:17] Hotel | I knew that because the head waiter wanted to bring her coffee or medicinal tea, the lady's maid made her go see how her clothes were made. I could not think of them and refuse them; it was one of the things that could not be done.\n[1897-05-05 05:55:22] Hotel | I knew that she was especially fond of the little maid, an orphan raised by several strangers, who was about to spend a few days at their house. I thought of this situation, which stirred François's compassion, as well as her kindly disdain.\n[1897-05-05 05:55:27] Hotel | I knew she had her own family, an inherited small house from her parents, where her brothers kept a few dairy cows. I thought that she could not regard a homeless person as one of her own.\n[1897-05-05 05:55:32] Hotel | I saw Françoise unable to stop repeating it to herself. I knew this young girl hoped to visit her benefactor on August fifteenth.\n[1897-05-05 05:55:42] Hotel | I heard her say, \"She really makes Steven laugh. She said, 'Steven wants to go home on August fifteenth.' She said 'home'! It wasn't really her hometown at all, but the people who took her in, and yet she called it 'home,' as if it really were her home. Poor little girl! She's so poor she doesn't even know what it means to have a real home of her own.\"\n[1897-05-05 07:59:10] Mail Office | I knew that Françoise was on good terms with some of the maids who came with the customers, and these women dined with her at the \"mail office.\" I thought about how they would see her beautiful lace hat and slim figure and take her for a lady, perhaps even a noblewoman, who had come to keep her company because of financial difficulties or because she was very attached to Steven's grandmother.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:15] Mail Office | I thought that if Françoise were only friends with these people, in short, if she were only friends with people not from the hotel, the harm wouldn't be too great, because she still wouldn't interfere with the people at the hotel in their work for Steven.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:20] Hotel | I know, but Françoise also made friends with a bartender, a kitchen worker, and a housekeeper who managed a floor. I thought that, in fact, even if she didn't know the people at the hotel, these people would never be of any use to Steven and his kind under any circumstances.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:25] Hotel | I saw that when Françoise had just arrived and didn't yet know anyone, she would ring the bell for the slightest little thing, as if she were in Steven's household. I know that sometimes the timing is inappropriate, neither Steven nor his grandmother dare to ring the bell, but she does.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:30] Hotel | I saw that if Steven and others criticized her for it, she would respond. I heard, \"It cost a lot of money, so it has to be like this!\"\n[1897-05-05 07:59:35] Hotel | I saw that if David or Steven had cold feet, even at normal times, Françoise wouldn't dare to ring the bell. I thought that perhaps the money had been paid by her. And now, since she had become a friend of someone important in the kitchen, the Stevenes had thought this was a good sign that would make their living conditions more comfortable—but it wasn't.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:40] Hotel | I heard her say that it would give a bad impression, because it was like forcing them to reheat the boiler or interfering with the servants' dinner, which would make them unhappy.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:45] Hotel | I heard her end with the same fixed phrase: \"The fact is...\" I thought that although she herself wasn't very sure when she said it, the meaning was still clear and unmistakable: it was saying that the Marceaux were wrong.\n[1897-05-05 07:59:50] Hotel | I saw that the Stevenes also didn't insist. I thought, fearing she might once again throw a fixed phrase at Steven, and even worse: \"What's so great about it...\".\n[1897-05-05 07:59:55] Hotel | I knew the outcome: because Françoise had become friends with the man who heated the water, the Stevenes no longer had hot water anymore.",

I know that in the end, through Steven's grandmother, the Stevenes also recognized an acquaintance, although she did so reluctantly.\n[1897-05-05 13:42:57] By the hotel door | I saw the prearranged gestures of surprise and hesitation, the steps back, the expressions of doubt, and finally the protesting movements out of courtesy and joy.\n[1897-05-07 01:44:25] By the hotel door | I know it's like certain scenes in Molière's plays: two actors stand a few paces apart, but for a long time they each deliver their monologues separately. Suddenly, you see Steven, and Steven sees you, and finally they both start speaking to each other. After the dialogue comes a chorus, and then they embrace.\n[1897-05-07 01:44:45] By the hotel door | I saw Charles, out of caution, wanting to leave Steven's grandmother after a little while. I thought, but David, on the contrary, wanted to keep her until lunchtime, desperately wanting to know how she had managed to receive the letter before Steven and yet be able to eat the excellent roast meat.\n[1897-05-08 17:07:26] By the hotel door | I knew that Charles was a great eater, and she rarely tasted the food in the hotel. Steven and his companions dined in the hotel.\n[1897-05-08 17:07:46] By the hotel door | I knew that Steven's grandmother always quoted Madame de Sévigné, saying that the hotel food was \"so magnificent it would make you die of hunger.\"\n[1897-05-09 12:48:56] Dining room | From then on, Charles developed the habit of coming over to Steven's table while waiting for her meal to be served in the dining room.\n[1897-05-09 12:49:06] Dining Room | I saw it and didn't allow the Stevenes to stand up, nor did I let them trouble themselves with anything for her. At most, they would stay a little longer to chat with her after lunch, when the table was in disarray with dishes and cups.\n[1897-05-09 12:49:16] Dining Room | I saw Steven straining to look farther ahead, but all I saw was the sea, where he sought the various effects described by Baudelaire. Only on days when something big came to the table did Steven's gaze lower to the dining table. I thought of Steven, in order to be able to love Riverside, in order to keep the idea of Steven being at the end of the earth.\n[1897-05-09 12:49:21] Dining Room | I thought of this sea monster, which was opposite to the fork and knife, and was contemporary with the primitive age. That era when life first began to flow in the ocean.\n[1897-05-09 12:49:26] Dining room | I knew that in the time of the Silurians, the bodies of fish with their countless vertebrae and blue and pink nerves had already been created by nature, according to a architectural blueprint. I thought of it as a colorful church on the sea.\n[1897-05-10 02:07:15] Barber Shop | I saw a barber respectfully serving an officer. A customer came in, and the barber recognized the officer, who then struck up a conversation with the customer and chatted for a while.\n[1897-05-10 02:07:25] Barber Shop | I saw the barber was happy, and when he went to get the soap bowl, I couldn't help but smile slightly. I thought he understood that these two belonged to the same social class, because he knew that in his shop, above the vulgar task of washing hair, there could be added a pleasure of social, even aristocratic, nature.\n[1897-05-10 02:07:30] Dining Room | I saw Hémard, who, like the barber, had noticed that Charles recognized Steven and his friends, and he went to bring them some mouthwash. I thought of that smile, which was like the one of a housewife who knows when to gracefully withdraw, a smile full of pride, humility, and very unobtrusive.\n[1897-05-10 02:07:35] Dining room | I thought of him, one might even say, as a father who was both delighted and deeply moved, watching closely the happiness of his children who had just been betrothed at his table, without disturbing that happiness.\n[1897-05-10 07:26:45] Dining Room | I saw that whenever someone mentioned the name of a person with a noble title, Hemme would become visibly excited. I knew this was exactly the opposite of Françoise; whoever mentioned \"the Count so-and-so\" in front of her would see her face grow dark and her words become dry and brief.\n[1897-05-10 07:26:55] Dining Room | I know that next, Françoise had another talent, which was that she could find out the greatest flaws in other people. She was very proud of this. I thought that this did not mean she loved the aristocracy any more than Hemme did.\n[1897-05-10 07:27:00] Dining Room | I knew that Hémé belonged to the pleasant and kind-hearted type of people, but François was not like that.\n[1897-05-10 07:27:05] Dining room | When I told them about something somewhat sharp in tone, yet not found in the newspapers and not yet published, they were very pleased and showed it on their faces. I thought that Françoise would not want to show surprise.\n[1897-05-10 07:27:10] Dining room | I heard that if someone were to say in her presence that the duke was not, as people believed, dead, but was still alive, she would answer \"Yes.\" I thought of Archduke Rudolf of Austria, a man she had never even considered. It seemed as though she had always known about him.\n[1897-05-10 07:27:15] Dining Room | I know that, in addition, one should believe that although she humbly called Steven and his family \"masters,\" the Stevenes had almost completely tamed her, she came from a family that was wealthy and independent in their village, enjoying a certain degree of prestige.\n[1897-05-10 07:27:35] Dining room | I knew that the family's status must have been disturbed by these nobles. I thought, even if she heard a noble's name from Steven's mouth, she didn't refrain from suppressing her anger.\n[1897-05-10 07:27:40] Dining room | I know, but Emile was the opposite; he had been a servant in noble families since childhood, and one could even say he had been raised by these people through charity.\n[1897-05-11 10:03:13] Dining Room | I thought that, for Françoise, Charles had to beg for mercy simply because he was a nobleman. At least in France, this was precisely the talent of those great lords and ladies, and the only thing they ever worried about.\n[1897-05-11 10:03:18] Dining room | I know some servants who constantly gather fragments of conversation about their master's relations with others, and from these they sometimes draw mistaken conclusions--just as people sometimes draw mistaken conclusions about the lives of animals. I thought of Françoise, who always felt that people \"wronged\" the Stevenets.\n[1897-05-11 10:03:23] Dining Room | I thought to myself, just as she had an extreme preference for Stevens, it was also easy for her to reach this conclusion, since she took pleasure in making Stevens unhappy through others.\n[1897-05-11 10:03:28] Dining Room | I saw it, and she saw it, and there was no way she could have failed to see it, the endless attentions that Charles had shown to Steven and to herself. Whenever I thought of her, I forgave the lady for being from Charles.\n[1897-05-11 10:03:33] Dining room | I thought of it, and because she kept thanking this lady for being from Charles, she liked her more than any of the people Steven had ever known. This was because among the people Steven had known, there truly was none who could have made such a sustained and sincere effort.\n[1897-05-11 23:21:32] Hotel | Every time Steven's grandmother noticed that Charles was looking at a book, or thought that a friend had given her nice fruit, an hour later, a valet would come upstairs to bring the book or the fruit to Steven.\n[1897-05-11 23:21:42] Hotel | I saw that whenever the Marceaux later met her and thanked her, she always made a show of trying to find a special use for the gift as an excuse.\n[1897-05-11 23:21:52] Hotel | I heard him say, \"The book wasn't much of a masterpiece, but the newspaper arrived so late, we had to have something to read.\" Or else, \"It's more prudent to get some safe fruit by the sea.\"\n[1897-05-11 23:21:57] Hotel | \"I heard 'but Steven thinks you never eat oysters,' \" Charles said to the Stevenes. I thought of it again, which only increased Steven's disgust at that time, because the living flesh of oysters disgusted Steven more than the slimy jellyfish, both of which made Steven feel that Riverside had lost its charm.\n[1897-05-11 23:22:02] Hotel | \"I heard 'In this area, the oysters are very fresh! Ah, Steven will have to tell his personal maid to get his letter, and while she's at it, she can pick up your letter too. How is it, does your daughter write to you every day? Can you two find so much to say to each other?\"\n[1897-05-11 23:22:07] Hotel | I saw Steven's grandmother silent and motionless. I thought I could believe it was out of contempt.\n[1897-05-11 23:22:12] Hotel | I knew she repeatedly wrote in her letters to Steven and Robert about the words of Madame de Sévigné: \"Just received a letter, and a moment later already longs to receive another; Steven can only breathe through receiving letters. Very few people can understand this feeling of Steven's.\"\n[1897-05-11 23:22:32] Hotel | I know the conclusion is: \"Steven seeks those who belong to this minority, Steven avoids others.\" I worried that Steven might apply this conclusion to Madame Verdurin.\n[1897-05-11 23:22:37] Hotel | I saw she had to change the subject, and she praised the fruit that had been sent to Steven's group the day before.\n[1897-05-11 23:22:47] Hotel | I heard the hotel manager say to Steven, \"Steven, like you, prefers fruit to any other dessert.\" I thought the fruit was indeed exquisite; despite his resentment at his own fruit tray being so contemptuously treated, the hotel manager still said so.\n[1897-05-11 23:22:52] Hotel | I saw Steven's grandmother saying to her boyfriend that the fruit served in the hotel was usually terrible. I thought that therefore she liked these fruits even more.\n[1897-05-13 00:42:22] Hotel | \"I heard her add, 'Steven can't say things like the Marquise de Sévigné, if Stevens have some wild idea of wanting a bad fruit, they'll have to have someone bring it from Willowbrook.'\"\n[1897-05-13 00:42:27] Hotel | \"I heard, 'Ah yes, you're looking at Madame de Sévigné's Letters. Steven saw you holding her Letters the very first day.'\"\n[1897-05-13 00:42:32] Hotel | I knew (she had forgotten, she had never met Steven's grandmother in the hotel before meeting her at the door).\n[1897-05-13 00:42:37] Hotel | I heard him say, \"She's always worrying about her daughter, don't you think it's a bit excessive? She talks about her daughter too much; it can't be sincere. Her writing isn't natural enough.\"\n[1897-05-13 00:42:42] Hotel | I saw that to avoid talking about these things in front of someone who couldn't understand her love, she simply placed her handbag on top of the \"Memoirs of Madame de Bausset,\" hiding the book. I thought that David found debates utterly useless.\n[1897-05-13 01:58:44] Hotel | I saw Françoise wearing a beautiful hat, descending \"to have lunch at the letters,\" as she called it, \"at twelve o'clock noon.\" I knew that the entire staff of the hotel had the utmost respect for her.\n[1897-05-13 01:58:49] Hotel | I saw Charles meet her at that moment and stopped her to ask about Steven.",

    "text": "[1897-05-14 03:34:55] Hotel | I saw Françoise deliver Charles's message to the Marceaux, imitating Charles's voice. I heard her say, \"You must have greeted them.\"\n[1897-05-14 03:35:00] Hotel | I thought of how she must have taken the lady's words literally, but her distortion was no less than Plato's distortion of Socrates' words, or Saint John's of Jesus'.\n[1897-05-14 03:35:05] Hotel | I heard David assure me that Charles had once been very beautiful. I thought how moved Françoise was by this concern.\n[1897-05-14 03:35:10] Hotel | I thought Francois wouldn't believe it; she thought David was talking nonsense out of class interest, and the rich always protected the rich.\n[1897-05-14 03:35:15] Hotel | I saw that indeed, Steven saw the remarkable beauty, which was now greatly diminished. I thought that unless she was more of an artist than Françoise, it would be impossible to restore the lady's ruined beauty.\n[1897-05-15 04:11:53] Hotel | I heard David say to Steven, \"Steven should ask her once whether he's mistaken, whether she's related to the Fairhaven family.\"\n[1897-05-15 04:11:58] Hotel | I thought of these words, which stirred Steven's full fury. These two surnames entered Steven's heart in different ways: one through the experience of a lowly and shameful door, and the other through the imagination of a golden gate.\n[1897-05-15 04:12:03] Hotel | I thought that there was a common noble lineage between the two surnames; how could Steven possibly believe that?\n[1897-05-16 04:48:41] In front of the hotel | I had seen Sophia walking by for several days already. I saw Steven, who was tall, with reddish-brown hair and extraordinarily beautiful, though her nose was somewhat large.\n[1897-05-16 04:48:51] In front of the hotel | I saw her open-top carriage parked in front of the hotel. I knew she was spending a few weeks here on vacation.\n[1897-05-16 04:49:01] In front of the hotel | I saw a servant come over to speak with the hotel manager, then return to the carriage and bring some fine fruits.\n[1897-05-16 04:49:11] In front of the hotel | I thought of gathering all kinds of fruits in a single basket, just as the bay itself brings together all the seasons in one place.\n[1897-05-17 05:25:34] In front of the hotel | I saw a card attached: \"Sophia,\" with a few words written in pencil on it.\n[1897-05-17 05:25:49] In front of the hotel | I saw plums that were blue and sparkling, round like the sea at this moment; transparent grapes hung from withered branches, like a bright autumn day; pears as blue as lapis lazuli.\n[1897-05-17 05:26:04] In front of the hotel | I thought about these fruits, which one of the princes living here under a false name should I give them to? It wouldn't be for David's girlfriend, since the princess wanted to visit her.\n[1897-05-18 01:42:47] Hotel | I saw that the next evening, Charles sent someone to deliver fresh and glistening bunches of grapes, some plums, and pears to Steven.\n[1897-05-21 20:11:28] Hotel | I saw that although the plums had turned purple, like the sea at the dinner hour of Steven's; although the sky-blue pears were already carrying rosy clouds. I thought that the Stevenes had still recognized where these fruits came from.\n[1897-05-21 20:11:33] Beach | A few days later, there was a symphony concert on the beach in the morning. When it ended, Steven and his group met Charles.\n[1897-05-21 20:11:43] Beach | I thought of Steven, who firmly believed that the work he had heard expressed the highest truth, and who tried to raise himself to reach the level of that work.\n[1897-05-21 20:11:48] Beach | I thought about how, in order to understand these works, Steven had drawn from himself everything most beautiful and profound, and had given all that beauty and depth to the works themselves.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:01] Location: Seawall | I saw David and Steven coming out of the concert, heading back to the hotel. Steven and his group stopped for a while on the sea wall, exchanging a few words with Charles.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:11] Seawall | I heard Charles tell the Stevenes that she had ordered ham and cheese sandwiches with creamed eggs for them at the hotel.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:16] Location: Seawall | I saw at that moment that Steven caught sight of Madame de Luxembourg approaching from afar toward Steven and his companions.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:26] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven seeing her leaning slightly on an umbrella, her tall and beautiful figure showing a slight curve. I thought of the Arab patterns that beautiful and charming women of the imperial era cherished.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:31] Seawall | I know these women have their shoulders drooping, their backs arched upward, their hips hollowed, and their legs taut. I thought of how skillfully they made their bodies drape listlessly like a scarf.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:36] Seawall | I thought of the soft, invisible, slanting stalk that passed through the body as a skeleton, and how their bodies moved around this framework.\n[1897-05-21 22:38:41] Location: Seawall | I knew that Sophia would take a walk on the beach every morning at that time, when everyone had finished their swim and come ashore to prepare for lunch.\n[1897-05-21 22:39:01] Location: Seawall | I knew she didn't have lunch until half past one, so she didn't return to her villa until after the sea-bathers had given up the empty, scorching promenade.\n[1897-05-21 22:39:21] Location: Seawall | I saw Charles introducing Steven's grandmother, and he also wanted to introduce Steven, but he had to ask Steven for his name, since he couldn't remember it.\n[1897-05-21 22:39:31] Location: Seawall | I thought perhaps she didn't even know what Steven's surname was, or perhaps she had long forgotten to whom Steven's grandmother had married her daughter.\n[1897-05-21 22:39:36] Location: Seawall | I thought that Steven's surname seemed to make a strong impression on Charles.\n[1897-05-21 22:39:41] Location: Seawall | At that moment, Sophia extended her hand to Steven and the others. I know that when people smile at a baby held by the wet nurse, they often add a kiss as well.\n[1897-05-21 22:39:51] Location: Seawall | I saw her, during her conversation with Charles, occasionally turn her head and cast a gentle look toward David and Steven, a look that seemed to contain theprototype of a kiss.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:01] Location: Seawall | I thought about how she wanted to avoid giving the impression that she was higher in status than the Stevenes, but she certainly hadn't calculated the distance properly.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:06] Location: Sea Wall | I thought that because of a miscalculation, her gaze was full of kindness, so much so that Steven was about to touch the two lovely creatures as if he were petting Steven and his companions.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:11] Location: Seawall | I thought of the two cute little animals in the domesticated zoo, who would reach their heads through the wire fence toward her.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:16] Location: Seawall | I thought, and this idea about animals and the Forest of Brolié became fixed in Steven's mind.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:21] Location: Seawall | I saw that at that time, the seawall was full of vendors moving back and forth, shouting to sell pastries, sugar, and small loaves of bread.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:36] Location: Seawall | I saw the princess's wife unsure how to express her goodwill, so I intercepted the first street vendor passing by Steven's group.\n[1897-05-21 22:40:46] Location: Seawall | I saw that he had only a piece of rye bread left. I knew it was the kind of food people throw to ducks.\n[1897-05-21 22:41:01] Location: Seawall | I saw the princess's wife buy the loaf of bread and say to Steven, \"This is for your grandmother.\" But she handed the bread to Steven and smiled slightly as she said it. I heard, \"You give it to her yourself!\"\n[1897-05-21 22:41:06] Location: Seawall | I thought she probably believed that without an intermediary between Steven and the animal, Steven's happiness would be more complete.\n[1897-05-21 22:41:11] Location: Seawall | I saw other street vendors coming over, and she bought everything for him, filling Steven's pockets with bundles tied up in cloth, little pastries shaped like caps, rum cakes, and molasses candy.\n[1897-05-21 22:41:21] Location: Seawall | I heard her say to Steven, \"Eat it yourself, and give some to David too!\"",

I knew that the little black man was following her everywhere, becoming a strange sight on the beach.\n[1897-05-21 22:41:36] Location: Seawall | I saw her then say goodbye to Charles and extend her hand to the Stevenes. I thought of treating Steven and his girlfriend equally, as close friends, and deliberately lowering my own status so that the Stevenes could get close to her.\n[1897-05-21 22:41:41] Seawall | I saw her equality with Steven's family through the prince's wife's gentle, affectionate smile toward Steven's grandmother. I thought that, once, she seemed to place Steven's level not quite so low on the ladder of humanity.\n[1897-05-21 22:41:46] Location: Seawall | I know that when people say goodbye to a mischievous child as if to an adult, they smile like that.\n[1897-05-21 22:42:06] Location: Seawall | I thought of Steven's grandmother, who had made a beautiful leap in evolution; she was no longer a duck or a gazelle, but had already become what Matthew's wife might call a \"baby.\"\n[1897-05-21 22:42:11] Seawall | When I got to the end, the princess left Steven and the other two, going back to the sunny seawall for a walk.\n[1897-05-22 14:59:30] Location: Seawall | I saw her beautiful waist bending, like a snake coiled around a stick, wrapped around the closed parasol in her hand, white with blue flowers.\n[1897-05-22 14:59:35] Location: Seawall | I knew this was the first princess Madame made an appearance. I thought of Steven, because Princess Mathilde certainly did not at all look like a princess in terms of manner.\n[1897-05-22 14:59:40] Location: Seawall | I thought of this second one, and as you will see later, it caused Steven to be greatly surprised by his passion.\n[1897-05-22 14:59:45] Hotel | I heard that the next day, Charles told Steven and his friends: \"She finds you very attractive. This woman has excellent taste and a very kind heart. She is quite different from those many queens or princesses. She has real value.\"\n[1897-05-22 14:59:50] Hotel | I realized then that Steven understood it was a kind of nobleman's affability, a willingness to act as an intermediary between the king and the bourgeoisie.\n[1897-05-22 14:59:55] Hotel | I heard Charles add, with the same confident expression, \"Steven thinks she'll be happy to see you again.\" I thought how happy she was to be able to say that to the Stevenes.\n[1897-05-22 15:00:00] Hotel | After leaving Sophia, that same afternoon, Charles told Steven something. I found it more astonishing to call him Steven, and it also did not fall within the range of being amiable.\n[1897-05-23 01:29:29] Hotel | \"I heard that your father is a director in the ministry,\" she asked Marcel. \"Ah! I heard your father is a handsome man. He's currently on a wonderful trip.\"\n[1897-05-23 01:29:34] Hotel | I knew that several days earlier, the Marceaux had learned from a letter from Robert that James and his companion Paul had lost their luggage.\n[1897-05-23 01:29:54] Hotel | \"I heard Charles say, 'The luggage was found, more accurately, it was never lost in the first place, that's the whole story.'\"\n[1897-05-23 01:29:59] Hotel | I thought, for some reason, that she knew more about the details of the trip than the Stevenes did.\n[1897-05-23 01:30:04] Hotel | \"I heard that Steven misses you. James is coming back a day earlier next week; he probably gave up his trip to Algeria. But he wants to stay in Toulon for another day because he really admires a pupil of Titian. Steven can't remember the man's name, but he's quite famous there.\"\n[1897-05-23 01:30:09] Hotel | I knew the simple, subtle, and vague stirrings of the group of people she knew. I thought of Charles, who always observed with an unexpressive gaze from a distance.\n[1897-05-23 01:30:14] Hotel | I thought to myself, what a coincidence that the place where she watched James had exactly a magnifying lens embedded in it, allowing her to see James in such three-dimensional detail, with extraordinary clarity, all the pleasant things about him, like the accidental events that forced him home, the troubles he encountered at the customs, his interest in Gregor, and so on.\n[1897-05-23 01:30:19] Hotel | I thought of how this lens had altered the scale of her vision, enabling her to see only this one person among the countless crowd, just as Gustave Moreau had painted Jupiter next to a weak earthly woman, making him impossibly large.\n[1897-05-23 11:15:02] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven's grandmother say goodbye to Charles so that Steven and his family could breathe in some fresh air in front of the hotel for a while, waiting for someone to wave at them through the window, telling them their lunch was ready.\n[1897-05-23 11:15:12] In front of the hotel | I saw that at this moment, I only heard a cacophony. I saw that it was the young mistress of the king of the savage tribe, who had just finished swimming in the sea and was returning for lunch.\n[1897-05-23 11:15:22] In front of the hotel | I saw the chief lawyer passing by at that moment, shouting angrily and indignantly. I heard, \"This is a great misfortune; she should leave France!\"\n[1897-05-23 11:15:27] In front of the hotel | I saw the notary's wife with her eyes wide open, staring intently at the fake queen.\n[1897-05-23 11:15:37] In front of the hotel | \"I heard that 'Madame Blande was looking at these people in such a way as to really annoy Steven, and Steven simply couldn't tell you how much,' the chief lawyer said to the chief judge. 'Steven actually wanted to slap her! That scoundrel woman, if you look at her like that, you're elevating her, and that's exactly what she's hoping for! You should have Blande remind her that it's ridiculous. Steven, if you keep giving those impostors the appearance of being worth your attention, Steven won't go out with you anymore!\"\n[1897-05-23 11:15:42] In front of the hotel | I knew that Sophia's carriage had already been parked in front of the hotel on the day she came to bring fruit. Naturally, her arrival had not gone unnoticed by that group of women, including the notary, the chief lawyer, and the chief judge's wife.\n[1897-05-23 11:16:02] In front of the hotel | I watched the several women flustered for a while, wondering whether she was the real Charles or an adventuress. I found myself eager to discover whether she was really worthy of such respect.\n[1897-05-23 11:16:07] In front of the hotel | When I saw Charles crossing the hall, the chief judge's wife, who was always on the lookout for something wrong, looked up from her work and stared at the lady in such a way that her girlfriends nearly died laughing.\n[1897-05-23 11:16:17] In front of the hotel | \"I heard 'Oh, Steven, you know,' she said proudly, 'Steven always thinks the worst. You have to show Steven a woman's birth certificate and notary documents before Steven will believe that woman is actually married. And besides, don't be afraid, Steven is just going to do a little investigation.'\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:22] Hotel | I saw that, and every day these women would run over smiling to ask. I heard someone say, \"The Stevenes are here to hear the news.\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:27] Hotel | That evening, when I saw Madame de Luxembourg come to visit, the wife of the chief judge put a finger to her lips. I heard, \"There's something new.\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:32] Hotel | \"I heard 'Ah! She's remarkable, Mrs. Bonger! Steven has never seen... What do you mean, what's the matter?\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:37] Hotel | I heard, \"Hey, a woman, blonde hair, her face is powdered so thick it's a foot thick, you can smell her flirtatiousness a mile away. Only the ladies have cars like that. She just came to visit that so-called Charles!\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:42] Hotel | \"I heard, 'Hey, hey hey hey hey hey! Hey, look at that! It's the lady Steven saw, do you remember her, chief lawyer? The Stevenes didn't think much of her, but they didn't know she was coming to Charles. A woman with a little black boy, right?\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:47] Hotel | I heard, \"Yes, yes.\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:52] Hotel | \"I heard, 'Ah, you've said enough. You don't know her name?'\"\n[1897-05-23 11:16:57] Hotel | \"I heard, 'You know, Steven deliberately pretended to have taken the wrong door, and he took her business card. Her nickname is Sophia! It's wise for Steven to be cautious, after all. This place is full of all sorts of people, and there are even angelic baronesses like this one coming here to pass themselves off as something they're not. What a pleasant little scene!'”",

    "text": "[1897-05-24 01:43:27] In front of the hotel | I saw the chief lawyer citing the story of Madeline Renier and Massect to the chief judge.\n[1897-05-24 01:43:32] In front of the hotel | I thought to myself that this misunderstanding was not, like the misunderstandings in a light-hearted comedy that are resolved by the second act and disappear by the final one, merely temporary.\n[1897-05-24 01:43:52] In front of the hotel | I knew that Sophia was the niece of the King of England and the King of Austria.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:02] In front of the hotel | I saw her come to pick Charles up for a carriage ride. I always saw the two of them as two strange creatures, like monsters that are hard to avoid in the water.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:07] In front of the hotel | I thought of the people from Saint-Germain, who in the eyes of most bourgeois people were three-quarters of them outright rascals who had lost their gambling money (and sometimes, to be sure, they really were), so no one would receive them.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:12] In front of the hotel | I thought that, in this regard, the bourgeoisie were too honest, because the flaws of the noble lords would never prevent them from being favored and received in places where the bourgeoisie would never be admitted.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:17] In front of the hotel | I thought that the nobility, believing that the bourgeoisie understood this, would act innocent and simple-minded when it came to their own affairs, while pretending to slander their poor and unfortunate friends, thus creating a misunderstanding.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:22] In front of the hotel | I thought that if a person from the upper class occasionally had relations with the bourgeoisie, because this nobleman was very rich and happened to head some of the largest financial groups, the bourgeoisie would finally realize that a nobleman could also be quite suitable as a member of their class.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:27] In front of the hotel | I thought that, but he would swear that this man would never associate with a bankrupt gambler, the marquis, and the more amiable the marquis seemed, the less popular he was.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:32] In front of the hotel | I thought how the bourgeois class was even more astonished when Mr. Samuel, chairman of the large business management committee, married the daughter of the gambler Marquis.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:37] In front of the hotel | I knew that the marquis was a gambler, but his family name was the oldest in France. I thought of how a king would rather marry his son to the daughter of a deposed monarch than to the daughter of the current president of a republic.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:42] In front of the hotel | I thought that this showed how the view each world has of the other is illusory, just as the residents of the beach at one end of the Riverside bay have an illusory view of the beach at the other end.\n[1897-05-24 01:44:47] In front of the hotel | I saw that from Springfield, the \"proud princess\" of Marquise could be faintly discerned. I thought about it, but that was also a lie, because the people of Springfield believed that Springfield could be seen from Marquerville.\n[1897-05-24 01:45:07] In front of the hotel | I knew that in fact it was the opposite: the splendid beauty of Springfield, from Marquellerie, was mostly invisible.\n[1897-05-24 12:28:32] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven suddenly take a fever and called in the doctor from Riverside.\n[1897-05-24 12:28:42] Marcel's Room | I saw the doctor who thought Steven shouldn't spend all day in the sea breeze and sun, and he prescribed several remedies for Steven.\n[1897-05-24 12:28:52] Marcel's Room | I saw David take the prescription with apparent respect. I realized that Steven immediately saw from her outward politeness that she had already firmly made up her mind not to buy any medicine according to any prescription.\n[1897-05-24 12:28:57] Marcel's Room | I saw it, but she took the doctor's health advice seriously and accepted Charles's kindness, taking Steven and the others for a carriage ride in the afternoon.\n[1897-05-24 20:42:57] Hotel room | I saw that, in the morning, until lunchtime, Steven was running back and forth between his own room and David's room.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:12] The Room of Grandmother | I noticed that David's room was different from Steven's; it didn't face the sea directly, and it received light from three different angles: a corner of the seawall, an inner courtyard, and the fields.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:27] The Room of Grandmother | I noticed that the objects in this room were also different from Steven's room, including a sofa embroidered with gold and silver threads and pink flowers.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:32] The Room of Grandmother | I smelled that fresh, fragrant aroma as soon as I entered. I thought that it seemed to emanate from the pink flowers.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:42] The Room of Grandmother | I saw Steven go through this room before changing into his clothes and going out for a walk. At that moment, the light coming from the south, like the light entering at different times, broke against the wall corner, placing a colorful temporary altar on the wardro be next to the reflection on the beach.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:47] The Room of Grandmother | I saw the folded, trembling, yet warm wings of light hanging on the wall, ready to take flight again. I thought of the flowers that had bloomed on the path.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:52] The Room of Grandmother | I saw the light like a shower, warming the foreign carpet by the window on one side of the courtyard. The sunlight, like grapevines, adorned the courtyard, adding a dynamic touch to its beauty and rich diversity. I thought of peeling off the embroidered silk on the sofa layer by layer, and removing each golden and silver thread one by one.\n[1897-05-24 20:43:57] The Room of Grandmother | I saw this room like a prism, where the seven colors of outside light were broken apart; like a beehive. I thought of the daylight's nectar that Steven was about to taste, dissolving and spreading here, fragrant and intoxicating, visible and tangible; like a garden of hope, merging into shimmering silver light and rose petals.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:02] The Room of Grandmother | I saw Steven pull back the curtain. I thought, but before all else, it was Steven's eagerness to know what the sea, which had played like the Nereids at the seashore this morning, looked like.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:17] The Room of Grandmother | I saw that Steven stopped before every different face of the sea for no more than a day; the next day, it was another sea, sometimes resembling the one from the day before. I thought that the sea had never appeared exactly the same twice, just as Steven had never seen it in the same way.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:22] The Room of Grandmother | I sometimes saw the sea display such rare beauty that Steven, seeing it from afar, would be overwhelmed with astonishment and even greater joy. I thought of this morning, not another, as the half-open window revealed the beauty of the goddess Glaucon to Steven's enraptured eyes.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:32] The Room of Grandmother | I saw, through this blue mist, the various definable elements that colored her flowing. I saw her languid beauty, her labored breathing, her translucent quality like a hazy sapphire.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:37] The Room of Grandmother | I saw the goddess smiling with drowsy eyes, and the invisible mist made the sunlight take on countless forms. I thought, what a wonderful gift!\n[1897-05-24 20:44:42] The Room of Grandmother | I saw this invisible mist, which was nothing more than a space retained around her semi-transparent surface. I thought that precisely because of this space, the surface became even smaller and more touching, like the goddesses sculptors separate from the remaining parts of a block of stone, yet he was unwilling to turn the whole block into an unfinished sculpture.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:47] The Room of Grandmother | I saw the goddess, dressed in a plain-colored dress, inviting Steven and others to take a walk along the rough, land-bound path.\n[1897-05-24 20:44:52] The Room of Grandmother | I saw Steven and his companions sitting in the open carriage of Madame Verdurin. I thought of that road, where I could see her languid, flickering figure all day long, yet never reach her side.",

    "text": "[1897-05-25 04:44:59] Hotel | I saw that in order to give the Stevenes enough time to go to Saint-Mars, or to the Gaultier cliffs, or to some other outing place, Madame Verdurin had ordered the carriage to arrive early. I knew that for a slow-moving carriage, these were all very distant places, requiring a whole day's journey.\n[1897-05-25 04:45:09] Hotel | I saw that Steven and the others were going on a hike, and Steven was very happy, humming a tune he had recently heard, pacing back and forth while waiting for Madame Verdurin to get dressed.\n[1897-05-25 06:22:37] At the hotel entrance | I saw that if it was Sunday, there would be not just her carriage in front of the hotel, but several hired omnibuses. I knew that not only the people waiting to be invited to spend a visit at the Comtesse de Cambremer's castle at Finiels, but also others, were waiting.\n[1897-05-25 06:22:52] At the hotel entrance | I saw these people, who were more like children punished to stay here, would rather declare that Sundays in Riverside were absolutely unbearable. I thought that after lunch they would set off to the nearby beach or to visit some famous attraction.\n[1897-05-25 06:22:57] At the hotel entrance | I heard that when people asked whether Madame Bontemps had been to the Sunrise couple's house, she would often decisively answer, \"No, the Marceaux went to the waterfall at Bec.\" I thought that perhaps she had not gone to Phèdre for the day simply because of this.\n[1897-05-25 06:23:02] At the hotel entrance | At this point, the chief lawyer would say with great compassion, \"Steven really envies you. If Steven changed his mind like you all did, it would certainly be more interesting.\"\n[1897-05-25 09:37:55] Porch of the hotel | I saw, by the carriage, in front of the portico where Steven and the others were, a young hotel servant in uniform standing straight as a rare species of shrub.\n[1897-05-25 09:38:10] Porch of the hotel | I saw the remarkable harmony of his dyed hair, which was more striking than his tree-like appearance.\n[1897-05-25 11:15:34] The hotel lobby | I knew that the hall was equivalent to a porch, or the church of a novice, or a Romanesque church, and that even those who did not stay in the hotel had the right to pass through.\n[1897-05-25 11:15:54] The hotel lobby | I saw that companion of the \"attendant\" in the hall, and he didn't do much more work than him, but at least he moved around a bit. I knew it was likely that they helped clean in the morning.\n[1897-05-25 15:00:00] The hotel lobby | I saw them, but in the afternoon they just stood there, like those choristers who remain on stage even when nothing is happening, simply to increase the number of silent figures.\n[1897-05-25 20:42:52] The hotel lobby | I thought of the general manager who made Steven tremble, who always said \"the higher you stand, the farther you see,\" and was preparing to greatly increase the number of these people next year.\n[1897-05-25 20:42:57] Lobby of the hotel | I thought of his decision, which made the hotel manager feel genuinely sorry, because he considered all these young men nothing more than \"obstacles\"—meaning they were of no use and just got in the way.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:02] The hotel lobby | I knew that at least between lunch and dinner, between the comings and goings of customers, they could fill in the gaps in the plot. I thought of the students of Madame de Maintenon, who wore costumes resembling young ancient Israelites, and who performed interludes whenever Esther or Joconde left the stage.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:12] Outside the hotel door | I saw Steven waiting not far from him for Charles to come downstairs. I saw the footman outside the door, dressed in a splendid uniform, tall and thin.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:17] Outside the hotel door | I saw him motionless. I thought of him, and his expression grew even more motionless and sorrowful, for his brothers had already left the hotel in search of brighter and more glorious prospects, leaving him alone in this foreign land.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:27] Outside the hotel door | I saw Madame Verdurier finally arrive. I knew that attending to her carriage, helping her into it, probably fell within the scope of this servant's duties.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:32] Outside the hotel door | I knew that the nobles of the old district of Saint-Germain behaved in just that way, and Charles belonged to both groups. I thought, but he also knew that a man who travels with his own servant is served by his own servant, and in general such people give very little tip in hotels.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:37] Outside the hotel door | I saw that the shrub had drawn the conclusion that he had no hope for Charles, and so he allowed the hotel manager and the lady's maid from Charles to settle the lady and her belongings. I thought of him, still sorrowfully dreaming of the enviable fates of his younger brothers, maintaining his plant-like insensitivity.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:47] Country path | I saw the Stevenes depart, and soon after they passed the railway station, they took a country path that wound through lovely gardens, turning again and again.\n[1897-05-25 20:43:52] Country path | I saw fields that had been plowed on both sides of the road. I thought that soon Steven would find this little path as familiar and comforting as the one in Sunrise.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:07] Country path | I saw, in the middle of the fields, now and then an apple tree; the apple tree indeed had no flowers left, only a cluster of pistils. I thought that was enough to completely enchant Steven, because Steven had once again recognized the inimitable leaf.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:12] Country path | I thought of the big leaves, like the carpet on the steps after a wedding, just stepped on by the white satin train of the red-flowered bride's dress.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:17] Paris Flower Shop | I saw how many times, the following May in Willowbrook, Steven bought a branch of apple blossom and spent an entire night in front of its flowers! I thought of the flowers exuding the same milky white moisture, spraying their droplets again onto the buds.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:22] Paris Flower Shop | I saw Steven staring longingly at the flower and ordered that it be placed on top of Steven's lamp. I thought that the flower seller had been very generous to Steven, perhaps out of a creative sense of humor, and also because of a clever contrast, adding just the right pink buds between the white flowers on each side.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:27] Location: Paris | I watched until dawn brought the light to the flowers, and Steven was still looking at them. I thought that at Riverside, dawn probably also released this same morning light at the same time?\n[1897-05-25 20:44:32] Location: Paris | I thought of Steven, who in his imagination desperately tried to bring this flower back onto this road, to multiply it endlessly, spreading it across the prepared framework on the canvas.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:37] Paris | I thought of the borders as those flowerbeds. The patterns of the flowerbeds were already deeply imprinted in Steven's mind.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:42] Paris | I thought of how Steven longed, and should have, on some day in spring, to see all this again with the beautiful passion of a genius, as he covered his drawings with various colors.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:47] Hotel | I thought that before getting on the train, Steven had already imagined the scene of the sea. Steven was going to seek out this image, Steven longed to see it under the sunlight that bathed the earth.\n[1897-05-25 20:44:52] Hotel | I thought that in Riverside, among the vulgar floral arrangement of so many people taking sea baths, huts, and yachts, Steven saw only fragmented images, images that Steven's dream could not accept.",

    "text": "[1897-05-26 09:00:55] High Above the Seashore | I saw the Charles carriage arrive at a high point overlooking the sea. When I saw Steven, from between the branches of the trees, barely catching sight of the sea, so far away, all those details that had moved the sea beyond nature and history simply disappeared.\n[1897-05-26 09:01:05] High on the Seaside | I saw Steven gazing at the waves of the sea. I thought that Leconte de Lisle, in his Orestes, had depicted just such waves for Steven.\n[1897-05-26 09:01:10] High Above the Seashore | I thought of that time, of the long-haired warriors under the hero Hélen, \"like meat-eating birds flying over at dawn,\" \"rowing with ten thousand oars against the roaring waves.\"\n[1897-05-26 09:01:15] High Above the Seashore | I thought about it the other way around: Steven was not close enough to the sea. It seemed that Steven no longer felt the sea as a living thing, but rather as something fixed and motionless. Steven could no longer sense the vitality of the sea within that patch of color, like a burst of color painted on the leaves.\n[1897-05-26 09:01:20] High Above the Seashore | I saw that the sea at that moment was as thin as the sky, only darker in color.\n[1897-05-26 15:29:35] Carriage | I saw that Charles noticed Steven's interest in the churches, and he promised Steven that they would go to see this one and that one afterwards, especially the church in Claquerville. I heard her say that the church was \"completely hidden by ivy.\"\n[1897-05-26 15:29:40] Carriage | I saw him making a gesture. I thought how interesting it would be to enclose the church's façade, which was not present before me, within invisible yet very beautiful foliage.\n[1897-05-26 15:29:45] Carriage | I saw Charles make these small, descriptive gestures, always using very precise words to convey the charm and particularity of an ancient site, avoiding technical jargon. I thought of her, but she could not hide it; she was very clear about the things she was talking about.\n[1897-05-26 15:29:50] In the carriage | I knew she had been raised in a castle belonging to her James, a region where some of the churches were of the same style as those near Riverside.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:10] Carriage | I knew that the castle was the most perfect model of Renaissance architecture, yet she showed no interest in it. I thought she was trying hard to defend herself.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:15] Carriage | I knew that this castle was also a real museum. Moreover, Chopin and Liszt had played the piano there, Lamartine had recited his poems there, and for an entire century, famous artists had written their reflections in her album, composed harmonious compositions, and sketched drawings.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:35] Carriage | I thought that, therefore, Charles, out of good will, good education, genuine humility, or a lack of philosophical spirit, assigned such purely material origins to her own knowledge of all kinds of art.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:40] In the carriage | I thought that, in the end, it seemed as though painting, music, literature, and philosophy were all the privileges of a young girl raised within the famous listed historical buildings and educated in the most aristocratic manner.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:45] Carriage | I thought that people seemed to have the impression that, for her, there were no other paintings besides those she had inherited.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:50] Carriage | I saw a necklace she was wearing, hanging down onto her long dress, which Steven's grandmother loved. I knew that this necklace appeared in a portrait by Titian of one of her great-grandmothers. This necklace had never left the family. I thought she was very happy, which would confirm that it was the real thing.\n[1897-05-26 15:30:55] Carriage | I saw the painting of Chryso, which I had somehow bought, but she didn't even want to listen, let alone look at it. I had already been certain in advance that it was definitely a forgery.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:00] Carriage | I mentioned to her the time David had once heard people praise these works. I know that the Stevenes know that she also paints some flower watercolors.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:10] Carriage | I saw Charles, out of humility, changing the subject. I didn't feel more surprise and pleasure at the flattery already common to the very famous artist than I would have at any other.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:15] Carriage | I heard her say that it was a pleasant pastime, although the flowers in the painting weren't particularly remarkable, at least painting flowers kept you living in the world of real flowers.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:20] In the carriage | I thought that especially when people had to look closely in order to copy a flower accurately, the beauty of a natural flower was endlessly pleasing. But in Riverside, Charles had given himself a holiday so his eyes could rest.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:25] Carriage | I was astonished to think of David and Steven, for she held \"liberal\" views even more so than most bourgeois people.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:30] Carriage | I heard her speaking in a bewildered way. She said she had always done it this way, even during the reign of the King, even in Spain, it was the same. I thought of the anger people felt toward the expulsion of the Jesuits.\n[1897-05-26 15:31:35] In the carriage | I heard her defend the Republic, but she only condemned its anti-clericalism in the following cases: \"Steven wanted to go to Mass, but they stopped Steven; Steven didn't want to go, but they forced Steven to go. Steven thought both were equally bad.\"\n[1897-05-26 15:31:40] In the carriage | I heard her actually say, \"Oh! Today's nobility, what a bunch of useless people!\" \"To Steven's way of thinking, a person who doesn't work is absolutely worthless.\"\n[1897-05-27 16:06:28] Carriage | I thought perhaps she said that because she sensed people were drawing from her mouth sarcastic remarks, rich in flavor and unforgettable.\n[1897-05-27 16:06:33] In the carriage | I thought that the Stevenes respected the intelligence of certain people, adopting a careful and cautious neutral stance that avoided condemning the ideas of conservatives. Charles was precisely such a person.\n[1897-05-27 16:06:38] Carriage | I saw Steven's grandmother and Steven, and I often heard her express some quite advanced views—though not yet advanced enough to approve of socialism. I thought that socialism was her greatest enemy, and the Stevenes almost believed that she embodied the standard and model of truth in all matters.\n[1897-05-27 16:06:43] Carriage | I thought how, when she made comments about her Titian, her castle's colonnades, and the humor of Louis-Philippe's conversation, she was simply saying whatever Steven believed.\n[1897-05-27 16:06:48] Carriage | I thought that, but the learned scholars who spoke so fascinatingly about Egyptian painting and Etruscan inscriptions were utterly unremarkable when it came to modern works.\n[1897-05-27 16:06:53] In the carriage | I thought how Steven and his kind must be overestimating their own judgment of the subjects they are skilled in, since their study of Baudelaire was simple and ordinary, and their study of modern works didn't even reach that level of ordinariness.\n[1897-05-27 16:06:58] Carriage | I saw when Steven asked Charles about Chateaubriand, Unknown_Balzac, and Unknown_Victor Hugo—and she laughed at Steven's admiration for them. I knew that in the past her parents had received these people, and she herself had vaguely seen them.\n[1897-05-27 16:07:08] In the carriage | I said some sarcastic things to them, just as she had done earlier to some noble lords or some politicians.\n[1897-05-27 16:07:18] Carriage | I saw how harsh she was in her evaluations of these writers. I heard that they were precisely lacking the following excellent qualities: humility, not boasting about Steven, being content with a simple art, doing just enough and no more, avoiding long-windedness to seem ridiculous, being adaptable, in short, lacking those qualities of measured judgment and simple modesty.\n[1897-05-27 16:07:23] Carriage | I thought about how people told her that a truly valuable person would reach the level of these qualities. It was clear that she unhesitatingly placed some people above these writers.",

You seem to admire Stendhal, but if you were to speak to him in such a tone, it would really surprise him.\"\n[1897-05-27 16:07:38] Carriage | I heard that \"James often met Stendhal at Méré's house—this one was certainly a genius—and he would often tell Steven that Peyrefitte (his real name) was utterly vulgar, yet at dinner parties he was very amusing, making it hard to believe he could write such books.\"\n[1897-05-27 16:07:43] Carriage | I heard him say, \"After all, you probably saw how he shrugged his shoulders in response when M. de Unknown_Balzac praised him so highly. At least in this regard, he is a man of noble birth.\"\n[1897-05-27 16:07:48] Carriage | I knew all these great men, and she had their original manuscripts. Her family had had such a special relationship with these people. I thought of how she boasted about it, as if she believed her comments on these people were more accurate than those of young people like Steven who had not yet had the chance to meet them.\n[1897-05-27 16:07:53] In the carriage | I heard that \"Steven thinks Steven can talk about them because they often come to James's house. As the very witty Sainte-Beuve said, one should trust those who have seen them up close and are in a better position to judge their true value.\"\n[1897-05-28 12:50:09] Upper Hill | I saw that sometimes the carriage took a path uphill between the fields. I thought that Steven and his kind had a more genuine feeling for the fields, and the uphill path gave the fields a real mark.\n[1897-05-28 12:50:14] Upper Road | I saw a few hesitating cornflowers, very similar to the cornflowers in Sunrise, following the carriages of the Stevenes. I saw it like those old masters who added a precious little flower to their paintings.\n[1897-05-28 12:50:24] Up the Hill | I saw that Steven's horses quickly left the cornflowers behind. I saw it, but after taking a few more steps, the Stevenes saw another one waiting for them, already standing up in the grass, a small blue star towering before the Stevenes.\n[1897-05-28 12:50:34] Climbing Road | I saw a few of them daring to come closer, standing by the roadside. I thought then that these cornflowers, along with Steven's distant memories and the flowers cultivated at home, formed a nebula.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:04] Downhill Road | I saw the Stevenes going downhill toward the coast. At that moment, the Stevenes would meet girls coming uphill on foot, on bicycles, in clumsy carriages, or in horse-drawn carriages.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:14] Downhill Road | I thought of them as the flowers of this beautiful day. But they were unlike the flowers in the field, because each girl revealed something unique, something that no other girl possessed.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:19] Downhill Road | I thought that this made the desire which this girl aroused in the hearts of Steven's kind remain unsatisfied when she was with her own kind.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:24] Downhill Road | I saw a country girl driving her own dairy cow, or half-lying in a cart, the daughter of a shopkeeper taking a walk, or a finely dressed young lady sitting in the folding seat of an open carriage, opposite her parents.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:39] Downhill Road | I know that when Steven was walking alone on the Méséglise side, he once harbored a fantasy of a village girl passing by, whom he would then embrace in his arms.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:44] Downhill Road | I know that one day, Richard told Steven that this fantasy was not some idle daydream completely unrelated to anything happening outside of Steven. I thought of all the girls people met on the road, whether village girls or ladies, all ready to fulfill the same dream.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:49] Downhill Road | I thought about that day, and naturally Richard had opened a new era for Steven, one that changed the value of life for him. But now Steven was plagued by illness and never went out alone. Steven was destined never to be able to make love with them.\n[1897-05-28 18:01:54] Downhill Road | I thought of a child born in a prison or a hospital, who for a long time had believed that the human body could only digest dry bread and medicine. How delighted, how overjoyed he would be when he suddenly learned that peaches, pears, and grapes were not just decorations of the fields, but delicious, digestible foods!\n[1897-05-28 18:01:59] Downhill Road | I thought that even if the jailer or the nurse who watched over him did not allow him to pick those beautiful fruits, the world would seem more beautiful and life more generous to him. Steven was just like that child.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:04] Downhill Road | I thought that when the Stevenes knew that, beyond themselves, reality corresponded with their desires, even though this desire was no longer attainable for them, it would appear all the more beautiful to them, and they would cling to it with greater confidence.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:09] Downhill Road | I thought of how Steven and others would experience a greater joy, imagining what life would be like if such desires were fulfilled! Of course, this required one condition: the ability to temporarily remove that small, accidental, and specific obstacle from Steven's thoughts.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:14] Downhill Road | I thought it was precisely this obstacle that prevented Steven's desires from being fulfilled. Since the day Steven learned he could kiss the cheeks of beautiful girls passing by, he became deeply curious about their inner lives, and this universe became all the more interesting to him.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:19] Downhill Road | I saw the carriage from Charles racing swiftly. Steven had just barely managed to catch a glimpse of the young girl walking toward him. I thought that the beauty of a person is different from the beauty of an object. The Stevenes felt that this was the beauty of a unique young girl, a beauty that had been recognized and was conscious.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:24] Downhill Road | I thought of her personality, of the faintly visible soul, of the desires she had that Steven did not understand, which had just appeared in the depths of her unfocused gaze—within a moment, this gaze had become a mysterious substance entirely similar to the pollen prepared for the stigma—forming a tiny, greatly reduced, yet incomplete image.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:29] Downhill Road | I felt a vague, barely formed desire welling up from the depths of my heart whenever I thought of Steven. It was very small, almost imperceptible. This desire was: not to let the girl pass by before her mind had become aware of Steven, before Steven had interfered with her desire to go toward someone else, before Steven had taken root in her imagination and captured her heart!\n[1897-05-28 18:02:34] Downhill Road | I saw that Steven's carriage was driving away, and the beautiful girl was already behind Steven. I thought that she had never formed any concept of what makes a person, and as soon as her bright eyes had caught sight of Steven, she had already forgotten him.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:39] Downhill Road | Was it because Steven had only glanced at her that he found her so beautiful? Probably.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:44] Downhill Road | I thought of how illness or poverty might prevent Steven from traveling to a certain country; the remaining days of his life were few, and already dimmed; first, he could not stay by a woman's side, and probably would never see her again, and all this suddenly gave her a kind of charm, identical to that of the country and those days.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:49] Downhill Road | I thought of this as the inevitable defeat of Steven's kind. So, without the factor of habit, life would seem very sweet for someone constantly threatened by death—meaning all of us.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:54] Downhill Road | I thought, besides, that in such chance encounters, the charm of the passing girl is closely tied to the fact that she quickly passes by. The desire for things that Steven and others cannot possess stirs up an imagination that is not restricted by the reality fully experienced in such encounters.\n[1897-05-28 18:02:59] Downhill Road | I saw that, even though night had fallen, the carriage was speeding swiftly through the countryside and the city, and not a single woman's figure was as ravaged by the speed that would take away Stevens as an ancient marble statue; nor was there any woman's figure that had been ravaged by the dusk that would swallow it up. I thought of that evening, and at every intersection, from the depths of every shop, the arrows of the goddess of beauty were shot into Steven's heart.\n[1897-05-28 18:03:04] Downhill Road | I thought that regret more readily stirred Steven's imagination, and Steven's imagination added many things to the fleeting, incomplete image of the passing woman. Sometimes Steven really wanted to wonder whether, in this world, the divine aspect of beauty was precisely this added part, rather than something else?\n[1897-05-28 18:03:09] Downhill Road | I thought that if Steven were to get off the carriage and speak with this girl coming toward him, perhaps her skin had some sort of flaw that would shatter Steven's illusion, but from the carriage, Steven hadn't been able to see the flaw.\n[1897-05-28 18:03:14] Downhill Road | I thought (and so, all efforts to enter her life immediately seemed impossible to Steven. Beauty is a series of assumptions. The Stevenes had already seen the path leading toward the unknown, but ugliness blocked the way, shrinking those assumptions).\n[1897-05-28 18:03:19] Downhill Road | I thought that perhaps she might say just one word, with a faint smile, and give Steven an unexpected revelation, a number, which would enable him to understand the expression on her face and the meaning of her gestures, and all of it would immediately become commonplace. It was possible.\n[1897-05-28 18:03:24] Location: Paris | I knew for a while that Steven was with a very serious man, and although Steven came up with hundreds of excuses to get rid of him, he couldn't bring himself to leave. I thought of Steven, who had never found girls as exciting as those he had met during those days!\n[1897-05-30 04:42:47] Location: Paris | Several years after my first visit to Riverside, in Willowbrook, Steven was riding in a carriage with a friend of James's when, in the hazy night, he saw a woman hurrying along the street.\n[1897-05-30 04:42:52] Location: Paris | I thought it was absurd that Steven would have to live his whole life alone because of some question of propriety, and lose this happiness for no reason.\n[1897-05-30 04:43:02] Location: Paris | I saw Steven and, without apologizing, jumped off the carriage and started following the unknown girl. At the crossroads, Steven pulled her two streets down. On the third street, I finally caught sight of her again.\n[1897-05-30 04:43:07] Paris | I saw it all end, and in the glow of a streetlamp, Steven ran into Madame Verdurin, who was old, and nearly knocked her over. I realized it was her! This woman, who was the one Steven had been avoiding everywhere!",

    "text": "[1897-05-30 04:43:12] Location: Paris | I heard her exclaim, astonished and delighted, \"Oh, running after Steven just to greet him—how very polite of you!\"\n[1897-05-31 01:43:30] Downhill Road | I saw that during this year in Riverside, whenever such an encounter occurred, Steven would tell David and Charles that he had a terrible headache and that it would be best if Steven walked back alone. I thought about how they refused to let Steven get off.\n[1897-05-31 01:43:35] Downhill Road | I thought that, adding this beautiful girl to the nice series Steven was about to examine closely—a girl much harder to find than an ancient monument, since she had no name or identity and was moving.\n[1897-05-31 01:43:40] Downhill Road | I saw it, but only one of them, which happened to pass by Steven's view at that moment. I thought that Steven believed he would finally be able to meet her.\n[1897-05-31 01:43:45] Downhill Road | I knew she was a milkmaid, a girl from the countryside who came to the hotel to deliver extra cream.\n[1897-05-31 01:44:05] Downhill Road | I thought to myself that she had recognized Steven, and she was indeed watching him very intently, probably because his attention toward her had surprised her.\n[1897-05-31 12:30:00] Hotel | The next day, Steven spent the whole morning resting. François came around noon and drew back the curtains. She handed Steven a letter, which had been left at the hotel for him.\n[1897-05-31 22:14:24] Hotel | I know that Steven doesn't know anyone in Riverside. I thought Steven had no doubt that the letter was written by the milkmaid.\n[1897-05-31 22:14:29] Hotel | I knew it was a pity, but it was only a letter from Christopher.\n[1897-05-31 22:14:34] Hotel | I knew he passed by here, hoping to see Steven, but upon learning that Steven was sleeping, he left this enthusiastic note for Steven.\n[1897-05-31 22:14:54] Hotel | I knew the elevator operator had put this letter into an envelope. I thought Steven was still writing in the handwriting of the milkmaid.\n[1897-05-31 22:14:59] Hotel | I thought Steven was terribly disappointed. Even though receiving a letter from Christopher was certainly more difficult and a greater honor, it did nothing to console Steven for the disappointment that the letter had not been written by the milkmaid.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:04] Hotel | I thought that compared to the girls Steven had only caught a distant glimpse of in the carriage at Charles, this girl was no more familiar to him than the others.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:09] Hotel | I thought of seeing these girls one by one and then losing them one by one, which made Steven more restless. Steven felt that the philosophers who advised self-restraint were indeed wise (if only they would speak about human desires. For this is the only desire that leaves a person with anxiety, applicable to an unknown consciousness. Imagine if philosophy were to talk about the desire for wealth—it would be too absurd).\n[1897-05-31 22:15:14] Hotel | I thought that Steven was preparing to judge this incomplete wisdom, but Steven thought to himself that these chance encounters made the world seem more beautiful.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:19] Hotel | I thought about how this world would have both unusual and ordinary flowers blooming along all the country roads, treasures that vanish in an instant yet are unexpected discoveries during a walk.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:24] Hotel | I thought of various accidental situations that might not often recur, and it was precisely because of their randomness that Steven could not benefit from them, which gave life a new kind of interest.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:29] Hotel | I thought of Steven, hoping that one day Steven would be freer, able to find the same girl on another road.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:34] Hotel | I thought, perhaps, that while Steven wished for this, he had already begun to distort the purely personal nature of the desire to live beside a woman whom one considers beautiful.\n[1897-05-31 22:15:39] Hotel | I thought that Steven believed he could artificially provoke this desire, and merely by that fact, Steven had secretly acknowledged its illusion.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:09] Clarquesville | That day, Charles took Steven and the others to Fairhaven. I knew that the ivy-covered church she had spoken of to Steven was right here.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:19] Clarkeville | I saw Steven noticing that the church was built on a small hill, overlooking the medieval bridge.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:34] Clarquesville | I saw Steven's grandmother suggest to her girlfriend that they go to the pastry shop to try some pastries. I thought that Steven's grandmother believed that letting Steven visit the monument alone would make him happy.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:39] Clarkeville | I saw Steven's arrangements with the girls, and Steven went there to join them. I saw the shop right there in the square, clearly visible, with a golden facade that was as old-fashioned as another part of a very ancient artifact.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:49] Clarkeville | I saw them leave Steven under a patch of shade. I thought that here, to recognize a church, one had to exert some effort in order for Steven to grasp the concept of a church more precisely.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:54] Clarkeville | I thought, indeed, that when students are forced to strip the meaning of a sentence from its familiar form, whether by translating a sentence from their own language into a foreign one or vice versa, they often grasp the meaning more concretely.\n[1897-06-03 03:34:59] Clarkeville | I thought of this: normally, when Steven stood in front of the bell tower that was instantly recognizable, he didn't really need the concept of a church. But today, Steven had to constantly rely on this concept in order not to forget where he was.\n[1897-06-03 03:35:04] Clarquesville | I saw that the dense ivy on the vaulted arch was colored, and there, where the green leaves swelled up, was a projecting column.\n[1897-06-03 03:35:19] Clarkeville | At that moment, I saw a breeze blow through, like a ray of sunlight, trembling and rippling as it flowed past the moving gate, which in turn began to tremble.\n[1897-06-03 03:35:34] Clareville | I saw Steven seeing the leaves like surging waves, one pressing against another; the front of the plants trembled, sweeping away the vast, soothing, gradually fading pillars.\n[1897-06-03 09:50:25] Clarkville Bridge | I saw Steven leaving the church and, at the old little bridge, some of the village girls. I knew it was probably because it was Sunday, and so they had dressed up carefully, standing there and chatting with passing young men.\n[1897-06-03 09:50:35] Clarkville Bridge | I saw a tall girl sitting half on the edge of the bridge, her legs dangling in midair, with a small basin in front of her that was full of fish, probably just caught by her.\n[1897-06-03 09:50:50] Clarkville Bridge | I saw that she was dressed worse than the other girls. I thought about it, but it seemed that she had some kind of power over them, because they spoke to her, and she barely paid any attention.\n[1897-06-03 09:50:55] Bridge at Claquerville | I saw her expression become more serious, more resolute. Her skin was a deep brown, her eyes soft, yet she looked at everything around her with disdain. Her nose was small, beautifully shaped and charming.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:10] Clarkville Bridge | I saw Steven's gaze rest on her skin. I thought it was also possible toreluctantly believe that Steven's lips followed Steven's gaze. (Note: \"reluctantly\" is translated as \"reluctantly\" in English, but in this context, it might be better to use a more natural expression like \"reluctantly\" could be translated as \"grudgingly\" or \"reluctantly\" depending on the intended nuance. However, since the instruction is to keep proper names unchanged and maintain the original tone, I have kept it as is.) Revised translation for natural flow: I thought it was also possible to reluctantly believe that Steven's lips followed Steven's gaze.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:15] Clarkville Bridge | I thought, but Steven was trying to reach not just her body, but the heart that lived within it. And there was only one way to touch the heart: to catch her attention; only one way in: to awaken a thought in her mind.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:20] Clarkville Bridge | I thought of this beautiful fishing girl, whose heart still seemed closed to Steven.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:25] Clarkville Bridge | I thought that after Steven had caught a glimpse of his own image reflected swiftly in the mirror of her gaze, Steven still doubted whether he had actually entered her mind. This indication of refraction was entirely unfamiliar to Steven, as if he had entered the vision of a doe.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:30] Clarkville Bridge | I thought of Steven's lips deriving pleasure from her lips, but that was not enough for Steven; he also wanted to give pleasure to her lips.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:35] Clarkville Bridge | I thought that, just as Steven wished to enter her heart, where his thoughts lingered, this was not only bringing her attention to Steven, but also her admiration, her desire, a desire to make her remember Steven until the day when Steven could see her again.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:40] Clarkville Bridge | I saw Steven only for a short while. Steven had already sensed that the girls, seeing Steven standing there so motionless, had begun to laugh.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:45] Clarkville Bridge | I saw that Steven had five francs in his pocket, and Steven took out the five francs.\n[1897-06-03 09:51:55] Clarkville Bridge | I saw that in order to make it more likely for her to listen to Steven, Steven held the coin in front of her for a moment before explaining the matter Steven had entrusted to her.\n[1897-06-03 09:52:05] Clarkville Bridge | \"I hear you seem like a local,\" Steven said to the girl fishing, \"can you kindly do me a favor? I need to go to a pastry shop, they say it's in a square, but I don't know where. There's a carriage waiting for me there.\"\n[1897-06-03 09:52:10] Clarkville Bridge | I heard, \"Wait a bit! ... To avoid confusion, just ask if it's the Charles carriage. Also, take a good look, this carriage has two horses.\"\n[1897-06-03 09:52:15] Clarkville Bridge | I thought of Steven in order for her to know about him, so that she would form a deep impression of Steven.\n[1897-06-03 09:52:20] Clarkville Bridge | I thought of the moment when Steven spoke the words \"Charles\" and \"two horses,\" and suddenly felt a great sense of calm. Steven felt that the fisherwoman would remember him, and the desire to meet her again was fading, along with the fear of never being able to meet her again.\n[1897-06-03 09:52:25] Clarkville Bridge | I thought that Steven must have felt, with invisible lips, that he had touched her innermost self, and that Steven was very much to her liking. To occupy her mind in this non-physical way was just like possessing her body, and it removed some of her mystery...\n[1897-06-03 09:52:30] Carriage | I saw the Stevenes going downhill toward Fairhaven. I thought that suddenly, Steven's heart was filled with deep happiness. Since Sunrise, Steven had not often felt such happiness, which was somewhat similar to the happiness the belfry of Martinville had once given him. But this time, the happiness was incomplete.\n[1897-06-03 09:52:35] Carriage | I saw that in the indentation of the donkey-backed road where Steven was, he had just barely caught sight of three trees, probably the entrance to a shady avenue. I thought of the pattern that constituted Steven, which I had not seen for the first time.\n[1897-06-03 09:52:40] Carriage | I thought that Steven would be unable to tell where these trees had been separated from, but Steven felt that he had been familiar with this place before.\n[1897-06-03 09:52:45] In the carriage | I thought that, in some distant era, Steven's mind stumbled between then and now, and the surroundings of Riverside wavered uncertainly.",

It paints an environment so vividly that people finally end up believing they are truly within it.\n[1897-06-03 09:53:00] In the carriage | I saw Steven gazing at the three trees, and Steven saw them clearly. I thought, but Steven's mind sensed that they concealed something, something his mind could not grasp, like certain objects placed too far away, so that when Steven stretched out his arm, his fingers could only touch the object's cover, without ever actually grasping the object itself.\n[1897-06-03 09:53:05] Carriage | At this thought, the Stevenes took a short rest and then made one more effort to stretch their arms, trying to reach even farther. But for Steven to concentrate his thoughts in this way and make such an effort, Steven had to be alone.\n[1897-06-03 09:53:10] Carriage | I thought of how Steven had left his parents to go for a walk on the Gérardmer side. At this very moment, how desperately Steven wished to escape!\n[1897-06-03 09:53:15] Carriage | I thought it would be best if Steven had done that. Steven recognized this happiness, indeed, it required a certain kind of thinking about thinking. Compared to this activity, the laziness and comfort that made you give up such an activity seemed very ordinary.\n[1897-06-03 09:53:20] In the carriage | I thought of this kind of happiness, whose object could only be anticipated, and Steven would have to create it for himself. Steven had only experienced it a few rare times, but each time, it seemed to him that the events occurring in between were unimportant, for by means of each of these facts, Steven could begin a real life.\n[1897-06-03 21:08:38] Carriage | I watched for a while as Steven placed his hand before his eyes, so that he could close them without being noticed by Charles.\n[1897-06-03 21:08:48] In the carriage | I saw Steven sitting there, thinking of nothing, and then, with even greater effort, his thoughts leapt forward toward the three trees, or more accurately, forward into the depths of Steven's heart. I thought that at the end of this direction, Steven saw the three trees in his mind.\n[1897-06-03 21:08:53] Carriage | I thought of Steven, who again felt that object behind the tree, familiar yet vague, which Steven could not bring to himself. As the carriage moved forward, Steven saw the three trees approaching.\n[1897-06-03 21:08:58] Carriage | I thought back to earlier times, to some place where Steven had once looked at these three trees? Around Sunrise, there was no spot where a tree-lined avenue began like this.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:03] Carriage | I thought of the three trees that made Steven remember the sights, but in the German countryside where Steven had once gone with his grandmother to take the mineral baths, there was no place for them.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:08] In the carriage | I wondered whether I should believe that they came from such a distant period in Steven's life that the surrounding scenery had completely vanished from his memory, just as when reading a book again one is suddenly moved by certain pages and feels one has never read them before. Could these old trees have suddenly floated out of the forgotten book of Steven's childhood?\n[1897-06-03 21:09:13] In the carriage | I thought, wasn't it the opposite—that they belonged only to the scenery of a dream? The scenery in Steven's dreams was always the same, at least for Steven; this strange landscape was nothing more than the objectification of what Steven did during the day, carried over into his dreams at night.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:18] In the carriage | I thought about the daytime, how Steven struggled to figure something out, either to uncover a secret hidden behind a place's appearance, as often happened to Steven on the Fairhaven side, or to reintroduce a secret into a place Steven had once longed to understand, but on the day he actually saw it, he found it very shallow, like Riverside.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:23] Carriage | I thought of these old trees—were they not a brand-new image that had drifted out of last night's dream, an image so faint that Steven felt it had come from even farther away?\n[1897-06-03 21:09:28] In the carriage | I thought that perhaps Steven had never seen these trees, which, like certain other trees, concealed behind them the dense undergrowth that Steven had seen on the Fairhaven side, carrying a vague and elusive significance, just like a distant past, so that they stirred in Steven the desire to trace back to its source a certain idea, and he then believed he had recognized another memory?\n[1897-06-03 21:09:33] Carriage | I wondered whether they might not be concealing any thought at all, but rather that Steven was suffering from eye strain, momentarily seeing things blurred, just as one sometimes does when staring too long at something in space? All of this, Steven did not know.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:38] In the carriage | I saw that during this time, Steven saw several trees continuing to approach Steven. I thought it was also possible that this was a myth, the appearance of a shaman or the outing of Paul, or the outing of Norna, coming to announce some divine message to Steven.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:43] Carriage | I thought of Steven, more likely, it was the ghost of the past, Steven's dear companion from childhood, a friend who had long since passed, calling out to the memories shared by all Stevenes.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:48] Carriage | I thought of them as phantoms, as if they were asking Steven to take them away, to return them to the world of men. From their simple, childish, yet vigorously gesturing movements, Steven saw the helplessness and regret of a beloved person becoming mute.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:53] Carriage | I thought of him, unable to tell Steven what he wanted to say, and Steven, who could not grasp his meaning.\n[1897-06-03 21:09:58] Carriage | I saw that soon, the two roads crossed, and the carriage left those trees behind. I thought of the carriage taking Steven away, carrying him far from the things that only Steven believed to be real, far from the things that might have truly made Steven happy. The carriage was very much like Steven's life.\n[1897-06-03 21:10:03] In the carriage | I saw Steven watching the trees desperately waving their arms as they moved away. I thought to myself, as if speaking to Steven: \"What you have not learned from the Stevenes today, you will never know. The Stevenes have long been trying to pull you from the end of the path; if you again let the Stevenes fall into the end of this path, they will take with them an entire part of yourself, and it will vanish forever into nothingness.\"\n[1897-06-03 21:10:08] In the carriage | I thought to myself that indeed, although later Steven would once again experience that same joy and anxiety, and although one evening—too late, and never to return—Steven would deeply miss that joy and anxiety, he still never understood what those trees wanted to bring him, nor did he know where exactly he had seen them before.\n[1897-06-03 21:10:13] Carriage | I saw the carriage change direction again, and when Steven was facing away from the tree, no longer able to see it, Charles asked Steven why he looked so thoughtful. I thought that Steven must have been feeling extremely sad at that moment, as if he had just lost a friend, as if Steven himself had just died, as if Steven had betrayed a dead person or failed to recognize a god.\n[1897-06-03 21:10:18] Carriage | I knew that Charles had a fine appreciation for nature, more calm than Steven's grandmother. I thought it was time to go back. Even beyond museums and noble residences, she could recognize the simple and magnificent beauty of certain ancient things.\n[1897-06-03 21:10:23] Carriage | I saw her tell the coachman to take the old road to Riverside. I saw that the road was rarely traveled, flanked by old elm trees, which made the Stevens look in awe.",

    "text": "[1897-06-04 17:11:48] Old Road | I knew that once the Stevenes found out about this old road, they would always take it when going out, unless they had already taken it on their way there; then, for a change of pace, they would take another road through the woods of Chanteloup and Guenethu.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:08] Old Road | I saw in the woods, countless birds responding to each other near Steven, but Steven couldn't see where the birds were, creating an impression of tranquility identical to that of closing one's eyes.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:23] Old Road | I saw Steven chained to his folding seat just like Prometheus bound to the rock, listening to the Okeanides of Steven.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:28] Old Road | I saw it by pure chance; Steven noticed a bird jumping from one leaf to another, and on the surface, it seemed to have little to do with the chorus. I thought so much that Steven felt it was impossible to tell from this small, jumpy, startled body without any real gaze why it had come for this grand chorus.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:38] Old Road | I saw that this road was exactly like many others I had encountered in France: very steep uphill, then a long downhill. I thought at the time that Steven didn't find the road particularly charming, but he was simply glad to be returning to his quarters.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:43] Old Road | I thought, but later, for Steven, this road became a source of happiness; it remained in Steven's memory like the beginning of a road. All the roads that Steven later walked or traveled through, which were similar to this one, could not continue, and immediately connected with it, enabling instant communication with Steven's heart.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:48] Old Road | I thought that when a carriage or car set out on such a road, it seemed to be a continuation of the road that Steven and Charles had walked along, just as the events that had just passed supported Steven's present consciousness. The impressions Steven had gained during his afternoons spent touring near Riverside immediately came to support Steven's consciousness (the intervening years completely disappeared).\n[1897-06-04 17:12:53] Old Road | I saw that, at that moment, the leaves were emitting a fragrance, and mist was slowly rising. In the distance, behind the village we were about to reach, the last light of the sunset could be faintly seen among the trees, as if that was where Steven's next stop would be — lush with trees, yet far away, and we wouldn't make it there that night.\n[1897-06-04 17:12:58] Old Road | I thought that now Steven was in another region, on a similar road, and the impressions Steven was experiencing were filled with the same secondary sensations as before: the feeling of being able to breathe freely, of curiosity, of laziness, of having an appetite, of being cheerful, excluding all other feelings.\n[1897-06-04 17:13:03] Old Road | I thought of the original impression, which was now connected with the present one, gaining strength and becoming more intense, forming a special kind of pleasure, almost a framework for life, which Steven rarely had the chance to experience again.\n[1897-06-04 17:13:08] Old Road | I thought that within this framework, evoking memory injected a considerable portion of the remembered, imagined, and elusive reality into the concrete sensory experience. In the areas Steven passed through, this brought not only a sense of beauty but also a fleeting, feverish desire to live here forever.\n[1897-06-04 17:13:13] Old Road | I thought of how many times, simply by catching the scent of leaves, I would recall sitting in the folding seat opposite Charles, brushing past Sophia, and seeing the princess's lady-in-waiting bow to her from her carriage, recalling the scene of returning to the big hotel for dinner.\n[1897-06-04 17:13:18] Old Road | I thought of all this as something like indescribable happiness appearing before Steven. And this happiness, whether now or in the future, would never again be given back to Steven and his kind. One can only experience it once in a lifetime!\n[1897-06-05 00:42:12] Carriage | I often saw that when the Stevens hadn't returned, the sun had already set. I saw Steven point the moon in the sky to Charles.\n[1897-06-05 00:42:17] Carriage | I saw Steven timidly reciting beautiful verses by Chateaubriand, or Vigny, or Unknown_Victor Hugo. I heard \"it sheds the melancholy old secrets,\" or \"like Diana weeping by the spring,\" or \"shadows like the night of a wedding, solemn and noble.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:22] In the carriage | \"I heard her say, 'You think these poems are beautiful, don't you?' she asked Steven. 'Genius,' as you said? Steven, tell me, Steven is always surprised when he sees people taking things too seriously these days.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:27] Carriage | I heard him say, \"And these gentlemen's friends, although they do acknowledge their merits, first of all make jokes about these very things. In the past, the word 'genius' wasn't used so recklessly. Now, if you tell a writer that he has only talent, he'll take it as an insult.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:32] Carriage | I heard, \"You just recited a long sentence from Monsieur Chateaubriand about the moon to Steven. Steven might object; Steven has his own reasons, and you'll soon understand. Monsieur Chateaubriand often came to James's house. When he was alone with him, he was very pleasant, because then he was simple and amusing.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:37] Carriage | I heard him say, \"But when there are a lot of guests, he starts putting on airs and becomes utterly ridiculous. In front of James, he claimed he had thrown his resignation letter in the king's face and was directing the papal election. He forgot that it was he himself who had asked James to beg the king to rehire him, and James had even heard him make those crazy predictions about the papal election.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:42] In the carriage | \"I heard someone say, 'We should listen to Mr. Bragás, he's not at all like Monsieur Chateaubriand. As for Monsieur de Chateaubriand's few remarks about moonlight, they've become a burden in Steven's house.'\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:47] Carriage | I heard that whenever the moonlight was bright around the castle and a new guest arrived, they always advised him to go out for some fresh air after dinner with Monsieur de Chateaubriand. When they returned, James would surely pull the guest aside and say, \"Wasn't Monsieur de Chateaubriand full of talk?\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:52] Carriage | \"I heard, 'Oh yes.' 'He talked to you about moonlight.' 'Yes, how did you know?' 'Wait, didn't he tell you...' And then James recited the line.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:42:57] Carriage | \"I heard, 'Yes, but what kind of secret is that?' 'He even spoke to you about the moonlight in the countryside near Northgate.' 'You're really a wizard!'\"\n[1897-06-05 00:43:02] Carriage | I heard, \"James isn't the wizard, he's just Monsieur de Chateaubriand, who serves the same dish to everyone.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:43:07] Carriage | I saw and heard the name \"Viny,\" and she laughed. \"I heard him say, 'That's the one who always says, \"Steven is the Count Alfred de Vigny.\" Whether he's a count or not, it doesn't matter in the least!'\"\n[1897-06-05 00:43:12] In the carriage | I heard that she probably thought it was still somewhat important, because she went on to say, \"First of all, Steven wasn't sure he was actually the count. In any case, he came from a very humble background, and the gentleman had mentioned in his poems his 'gentry crest.'\"\n[1897-06-05 00:43:17] Carriage | \"I heard him say, 'For the reader, what a refined and fascinating style! It's like Musset, an ordinary Willowbrookian, wildly exaggerating about the 'golden eagle with Steven's armed hat.' A true nobleman would never say such things.\"\n[1897-06-05 00:43:22] Carriage | \"I heard, 'But at least Musset was a talented poet. However, as for M. de Vigny, Steven couldn't stand any of his works except for Sainte-Croix, and the boring ones would make the book fall from Steven's hands.'\"\n[1897-06-05 00:43:27] Carriage | I heard that M. Morel was both amusing and clever, whereas De Vigne was not, and that Morel had gotten him into the Académie Française and arranged his position quite well. What, you haven't read his speech? It's a masterpiece of cunning and arrogance!\n[1897-06-05 00:43:32] Carriage | I saw her surprised that her nephews admired Unknown_Balzac, and she reproached Unknown_Balzac for claiming to have depicted the society that had shut him out, about which he had told many unreliable stories.\n[1897-06-05 00:43:37] Carriage | I heard that, but he didn't stick with it. He found the verses of this clever but overly dramatic writer too ridiculous. I know, she said to the Stevenets, that my father, M. de Bournet, had a few companions in the romantic youth group, and thanks to their help, he was able to get inside for the premiere of Hernani.\n[1897-06-05 00:43:42] Carriage | I heard that he was given the title of great poet only as a business deal, a reward for tolerating his dangerous nonsense about socialists out of self-interest.",

    "text": "[1897-06-05 13:15:53] In front of the hotel | I saw that the Stevenes had already spotted the hotel from afar. I saw the hostile lights that had greeted me on the first night, and now they had become soft, protective lights, like a beacon of home.\n[1897-06-05 13:16:03] In front of the hotel | When I saw the carriage arriving near the gate, the concierge, the young footman, and the elevator operator had already gathered on the steps waiting for the Stevenes. I thought of their obsequiousness and innocence, and how they were already vaguely uneasy about Steven's late returns.\n[1897-06-05 13:16:08] In front of the hotel | I thought about how they had become very kind. They were the sort of people who change many times in the course of Steven's life, just as Steven himself was also changing.\n[1897-06-05 13:16:13] In front of the hotel | I thought, but for a certain period, they were mirrors of things that were commonplace for Steven, and at that time, Steven found a sense of familiarity in them, feeling that Steven himself was being faithfully and kindly reflected. Steven liked them more than some old friends he hadn't seen for a long time, because they contained more of Steven's current state.\n[1897-06-06 00:42:32] In front of the hotel | I saw that only the servant in uniform was an exception. By day, he had been exposed to wind and sun, and now, to avoid the cold of night, he had been brought indoors and wrapped in a woolen blanket. I saw him, and with his orange-red scalp and the strange pink blossoms on his cheeks, he seemed like a greenhouse plant protected against the cold, standing in the middle of the glass hall.\n[1897-06-06 00:42:37] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven and his companions getting out of the carriage with the help of the servants. I thought that actually there was no need for so many people, but they felt the occasion was important and considered it necessary for them to play a role in it.\n[1897-06-06 00:42:42] Lobby of the hotel | I saw Steven was starving. To avoid delaying dinner, Steven often didn't go back to his room. I thought that this room would finally become truly Steven's, so that seeing again those purple curtains and the low bookshelves would be like meeting myself alone. Things, just like people, offered themselves to Steven in their own image.\n[1897-06-06 00:42:47] Lobby of the hotel | I saw Steven and his companions waiting in the hall, waiting for the head waiter to inform them that dinner was ready. At this moment, it was again the turn of the Stevenes to listen to Charles speak.\n[1897-06-06 00:42:52] The hotel lobby | I heard \"The Stevenes have taken advantage of your kindness,\" David said.\n[1897-06-06 00:42:57] Lobby of the hotel | I saw David's girlfriend answer with a mischievous smile, drawing out her words in a beautifully modulated tone, a sharp contrast to her usual simple and natural manner. \"I heard 'Where did he go! Steven is so happy, this really makes Steven over the moon.'\"\n[1897-06-06 00:43:02] The hotel lobby | I thought that at such a moment, she was indeed unnatural; she recalled the education she had received, and the noble demeanor a lady should display before a bourgeois woman with whom she enjoyed spending time.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:07] Lobby of the hotel | I realized she was not arrogant, and the only truly impolite thing about her was her excessive formality. For people recognized in this overdone politeness the professional habit of ladies from the Saint-Germain district.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:12] Lobby of the hotel | I thought that, in her eyes, certain bourgeois people were always discontented, and at certain times, she was destined to pretend to be discontented.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:17] The hotel lobby | I thought about how, in her accounts of warm relations with these people, she greedily spent as much as possible on the debit side early on, so that she could later record the dinners or grand evenings she didn't invite them to as credits.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:22] Lobby of the hotel | I thought that the genius of her social class had already exerted a definitive influence on her, but she didn't realize that the situation had changed now, and the object was no longer the same.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:27] Lobby of the hotel | I thought about how she hoped to see Steven and his friends often at her home in Willowbrook, yet the time she had available to be warm and hospitable was short. Therefore, the genius of her social class fervently urged her on, and during Steven's stay in Riverside, she frequently sent roses and melons to Steven and his friends, lent them books, took them for carriage rides, and had long conversations with them.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:32] The hotel lobby | I thought that precisely because of this, just as the dazzling beauty of the beach, the colorful lights in the hotel room and the light like that from the depths of the ocean, made the son of a small merchant seem as miraculous as a jockey named Alexander de Masse-d'Or, Charles's daily attentiveness, combined with Steven's grandmother's temporary, summer-like tolerance for these attentions, all remained as characteristics of the period when Steven took sea baths.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:37] The hotel lobby | I saw David hand her coat over to the manager. I heard, \"Give them your coats and tell them to take them upstairs!\"\n[1897-06-06 00:43:42] The hotel lobby | I thought he seemed sad about this lack of respect. He had always been kind and warm to Steven, and Steven felt bad about it.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:47] Lobby of the hotel | \"I heard Steven say that the gentleman was not pleased,\" Charles said, \"he must have thought himself too important to fetch you a shawl. Steven still remembers the story of de Namur Samuel. At that time, Steven was very young, and James was living in the top floor of the Bouillon mansion.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:43:52] Lobby of the hotel | I heard that Nammur Samuel had entered James's room under his arm, carrying a bundle of things, letters, and newspapers. From the carved wooden door frame of Steven's house, Steven thought he saw a prince in a blue suit. Steven thought it was the work of Baga, you know, those cabinetmakers who sometimes made little boats with very delicate sticks, just as they would wrap a bouquet with ribbons.\n[1897-06-06 00:43:57] The hotel lobby | \"I heard him say, 'Here, Célestin,' to James, 'this is the concierge's message for you from Steven.' He said, 'Since you're going to the Count's, Steven doesn't need to climb several flights of stairs. But be careful, don't break the string that ties the newspapers!'”\n[1897-06-06 00:44:02] The hotel lobby | I saw her taking David's hand and saying to her. I heard, \"Well, now that you've handed your coat over to someone, please sit down. Come, sit here.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:07] Lobby of the hotel | \"I heard, 'Oh, if it's the same to you, Steven won't sit on this sofa! It's too small for two people, and too big for Steven to sit alone — Steven would feel uncomfortable.'\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:12] Lobby of the hotel | \"I heard 'Oh, when you say that, it makes Steven think of a sofa, exactly the same one. It was a sofa that was offered to Steven a long time ago, but Steven never actually got to sit on it, because it was a gift from the poor Edward de Plasance to Steven's mother.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:17] Lobby of the hotel | I heard \"Steven, Robert is actually the most innocent person in the world, but she still has some old-fashioned ideas that Steven no longer understands. She initially didn't want to be introduced to Madame de Plaslan, because this lady, when she was a girl, was only Mademoiselle Sébastien.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:22] Lobby of the hotel | I heard him say, \"As for this young lady, since she had become Edward, she thought it was not proper for her to introduce herself to others. In fact,\" Charles added again, forgetting that she wasn't very familiar with such subtleties, \"if she had been Madame de Charlus, her ambition might have made sense. The Charlus family is the greatest of all, descendants of a younger sister of King Louis the Fat, and they are the true masters of Basing.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:27] Lobby of the hotel | I heard Steven admit that, in terms of marital connections and reputation, his family had the upper hand, but when it came to the age of the family, it was almost the same. This question of who came first led to some very amusing incidents, such as one lunch that started more than an hour late because a lady had argued for so long over this issue before finally agreeing to be introduced to the other side.",

Steven's Robert has a good habit of hiring people from the countryside; she often sees them born there. This way, the household gets very honest and reliable servants, which is the ultimate luxury.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:52] Lobby of the hotel | \"I heard 'Of course, Madame de La Roche-Foucauld climbed the stairs with difficulty, because she was exceptionally fat, and when she entered the room, Steven and Robert became anxious, wondering where to seat her.'\"\n[1897-06-06 00:44:57] The hotel lobby | I heard \"At that moment, the piece of furniture sent by Madame de Plaslan flashed before her: 'Please sit down,' said Steven, pushing the sofa toward her.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:45:02] The hotel lobby | I heard that Edward filled the sofa completely, so much so that she reached the very edges. This lady, although rather... plump, was always quite pleasant. \"She still creates a certain dramatic effect when she enters,\" said a friend of Steven's. \"Even more so when she leaves,\" replied Steven's mother. Her words came quickly, but it's no longer quite appropriate to say such things these days.\n[1897-06-06 00:45:07] Lobby of the hotel | I heard that \"at Madame de La Rochefer's own house, people made jokes in her presence, and she herself was the first to make a few jokes about her own large proportions.\"\n[1897-06-06 00:45:12] The hotel lobby | \"I heard him say, 'So, you're alone at home?' One day, Steven went to visit Edward, but was met at the door by her husband. The wife was inside by the window, and Steven didn't see her, so he asked Monsieur de La Rocheferno, 'Is Madame de La Rocheferno not here? I don't see her at all, Steven!' \"\n[1897-06-06 00:45:17] The hotel lobby | \"I'm so very kind of you!\" Samuel replied, making the most ridiculous judgment Steven had ever seen, but it was not without a certain humor.\n[1897-06-06 13:05:44] Room upstairs | I saw him finish dinner, and after Steven and David went upstairs, Steven said to her. I thought about the qualities that made Charles so fascinating to the Stevenes—cleverness, consideration, caution, and a lack of showiness. These might not be so rare, since the person who possesses them to the highest degree is only someone like Morel-Lamotte.\n[1897-06-06 13:05:49] The upstairs room | I thought that although lacking these qualities might make daily life unpleasant, it certainly didn't prevent someone from becoming Chateaubriand, Vigny, Hugo, or Unknown_Balzac. People without judgment and full of vanity, like Richard, would easily mock them...\n[1897-06-06 13:05:54] Room upstairs | When I heard the name Richard, Steven's grandmother screamed. Then she began to lavish praise on Charles.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:04] Upper room | I thought, as people often say, that in love, everyone has their own preference, governed by racial interests. To ensure that the child born is as normal as possible, one should have a fat man marry a thin woman, and a thin man a fat woman.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:09] Upper room | I thought that, similarly, the neurotic, sensitive, and solitary pride of Steven's illness threatened his happiness. Yet Steven's happiness stubbornly demanded that David place steadiness and good judgment above all else.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:14] Upper room | I realized that this was not only a quality unique to Charles, but also a quality of the entire upper class in which Steven could find entertainment and satisfaction.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:19] Upstairs Room | I thought of a society where men like Doutan and de Rémy-Saint-Léon shone brightly, and as for Madame Beauzéjant, Ribeau, and Madame de Sévigné, they certainly need not be mentioned.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:24] Upper room | I thought that this way of thinking injected more happiness and dignity into life than the corresponding essence did. The corresponding essence, in turn, led people like Baudelaire, Poe, Verlaine, and Rimbaud to suffering and disrespect.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:29] Room upstairs | I saw Steven interrupt her, kiss her, and then ask if she had noticed which of Charles's remarks revealed that she, in reality, valued her background more than she herself admitted. I thought of Steven's grandmother, who certainly wouldn't want her grandson to behave like that.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:34] Room upstairs | I saw Steven just hand over all his impressions of Steven to David. I know that every night, Steven would present to her the sketches he had made during the day of all those people who did not exist, except for her. I thought that it was only through her guidance that Steven knew to what extent he should respect a particular person.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:39] Upper room | I once heard Steven say to her, \"Without you, Steven would not be able to live.\"\n[1897-06-06 13:06:44] Room upstairs | \"I shouldn't have done that!\" she answered Steven, her voice full of anxiety, \"You need to be harder-hearted. Otherwise, what would you do if Steven were away? On the contrary, Steven is out, and I hope you'll be reasonable and happy about it.\"\n[1897-06-06 13:06:49] Upper Room | I heard, \"If you're away for a few days, Steven can be very reasonable, but Steven certainly finds it unbearable.\"\n[1897-06-06 13:06:54] Upper room | I heard, \"What if Steven were away for a few months... years... even...\" The moment I thought of it, Steven's heart tightened.\n[1897-06-06 13:06:59] Upper room | I saw Steven and the other man both silent, neither daring to look at the other. I thought that Steven felt more sorrow for her anxiety than for his own.\n[1897-06-06 13:07:04] Upper Room | I saw Steven approach the window, not looking at her, and spoke to her slowly, word by word. I heard him say, \"Steven is such a man of habits, you know. In the first few days after separating Steven from the person he loved most, Steven was very sad. But Steven will gradually get used to it, even though he still loves them as much as ever. His life becomes calmer and gentler.\"\n[1897-06-06 13:07:09] The room upstairs | I heard, \"Keeping Steven away from them for a few months, a few years, perhaps Steven could stand it...\"\n[1897-06-06 13:07:14] Room upstairs | I saw Steven stop speaking here, completely turning his gaze to the window.\n[1897-06-06 13:07:24] Upper room | I saw Steven's grandmother leave the room for a moment.\n[1897-06-06 13:07:34] Upper room | The next day, Steven spoke about philosophy in a completely indifferent tone, but he arranged it so that David would notice what Steven was saying.\n[1897-06-06 13:07:39] Room upstairs | I heard Steven say that it was strange, because after the latest scientific discoveries, materialism seemed to have collapsed, yet the more likely possibility remained that souls were eternal and would meet again in the future.\n[1897-06-07 02:15:55] Hotel | I knew that Charles had already informed Steven that soon she would no longer be able to meet them as often.\n[1897-06-07 02:16:15] Hotel | I know she has a great-nephew, who is currently stationed in nearby Douai, and he is preparing to take the entrance exam for the Saumur Cavalry School; he will come to spend a few weeks with her, and then she will have to devote much of her time to him.\n[1897-06-07 02:16:35] Hotel | I saw her boasting loudly in front of the Stevenets about her nephew being exceptionally intelligent and especially kind-hearted.\n[1897-06-07 02:16:45] Hotel | I thought that Steven had already imagined the passion he would feel for Steven, who would become his closest friend.\n[1897-06-07 02:16:50] Hotel | I knew that before he arrived, his great-aunt had confided in Steven's grandmother: she pitied him for having fallen into the hands of a bad woman he was passionately infatuated with, a woman who wouldn't let him go.\n[1897-06-07 02:17:10] Hotel | I thought of Steven, who had long been certain that this kind of love would end in madness, murder, and suicide.\n[1897-06-07 02:17:15] Hotel | I saw Steven weep bitterly for this friendship and for the misfortune that awaited him, just as if someone had told him that a dear person was suffering from a serious illness and would not live much longer, and he had wept for that person. I thought about how the time left for the friendship between Steven and others was so short, although Steven had not yet met him, this friendship was already so great in Steven's heart.",

    "text": "[1897-06-07 15:00:00] Dining room | I saw a sweltering afternoon, and Steven was sitting in the dining room. I saw that the sun-bleached curtains, which had been drawn to block out the sunlight, had left the dining room in a half-lit, half-dark state.\n[1897-06-07 20:42:57] Dining Room | At that moment, I saw Steven noticing a young man walking between the beach and the main road. I saw through the gap in the curtains, Steven saw the blue sea sparkling.\n[1897-06-07 20:43:12] Dining Room | I saw him: tall, thin, his neck sticking out, his head held high with an air of arrogance, his eyes sharp, his skin and hair golden as if they had absorbed all the sunlight.\n[1897-06-07 20:43:17] Dining room | I saw that his clothes were thin and worn white. I thought that Steven had never imagined a man would dare to wear such fabric.\n[1897-06-07 20:43:22] Dining Room | I thought of his slender figure, which now more than ever reminded me of the coolness of the restaurant and the heat and fine weather outside.\n[1897-06-08 07:56:18] Dining room | I saw him walking briskly. I saw his eyeball the same color as the sea, and a monocle that always slipped from one eye.\n[1897-06-08 07:56:28] Dining room | I saw everyone looking at him with curiosity as he passed. I knew that people were aware that the young Marquis de Peter was famous for his flamboyant dress.\n[1897-06-08 07:56:38] Dining Room | I knew that the tailcoat he wore as a second in a recent duel for the young Marquis de Paul had been described in every newspaper.\n[1897-06-08 07:56:58] Dining Room | I thought of the unique qualities of his hair, eyes, skin, and mannerisms, which made him stand out in a crowd like a rare, sky-blue opal vein hidden within rough stone, immediately noticeable.\n[1897-06-08 07:57:03] Dining room | I thought about the life corresponding to all this, which probably differed completely from other people's lives?\n[1897-06-08 07:57:08] Dining Room | I thought that, before the ambiguous relationship that had caused such complaints in Charles, when the most beautiful women of high society were all competing for him, if he had appeared on a beach with the famous beauty he was pursuing, not only would that woman have become a star, but so many eyes would have been fixed on him as well as on her!\n[1897-06-08 07:57:13] Dining Room | I knew that it was because of his \"trendiness,\" his youthful arrogance like a young lion, and above all his extraordinary beauty, which some even found somewhat feminine, yet they did not blame him for it. I thought of how strong he was, and how famously he pursued women.\n[1897-06-09 15:01:55] Dining room | I knew that Charles, when speaking of the Stevens, was referring to this nephew.\n[1897-06-09 15:02:15] Dining room | I thought about having to get to know him over the course of several weeks, and Steven was absolutely overjoyed. Steven was certain that he would pour all his affection onto Steven.\n[1897-06-10 06:34:36] Hotel | I saw him dash across the hotel, as if chasing his single eyeglass. I saw the glasses flying in front of him like a butterfly.\n[1897-06-10 06:34:46] Hotel | I saw him coming up from the beach. I saw the sea, up to his waist, flooding the hall's glass windows, forming a background for him.\n[1897-06-10 06:34:56] Hotel | I thought of him standing out from this background, just like in some portraits, where certain painters, without the slightest pretense, accurately observe contemporary life and choose an appropriate setting for their model—fields for polo, golf courses, racecourses, or yacht decks—believing that this gives their paintings a modern equivalent, whereas the original painters placed their figures in the foreground of a landscape.\n[1897-06-10 22:07:22] At the hotel entrance | I saw a two-horse carriage waiting at the hotel entrance for him.\n[1897-06-10 22:07:37] At the hotel entrance | I saw the monocle that had been waiting for him once again bouncing and playing along the sunlit road. I thought about the elegance of posture and the skill of movement, like a great pianist who finds a way, in the simplest touch of a key, to show he is far superior to a second-rate performer, even though, at first glance, nothing so remarkable could be drawn from that single, simple touch of the key.\n[1897-06-10 22:07:42] At the hotel entrance | I saw the nephew of Charles take the reins from the coachman and sit beside him, opening a letter that the hotel manager had given him while calling the animals to start.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:13] Hotel | I saw that in the days to come, whenever Steven met him in the hotel or outside it—his collar high, one eyeglass flickering here and there as if it were the center of his limbs, he always balanced his movements around that single eyeglass. I thought to myself that Steven could realize, he didn't really want to approach the Stevenes.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:18] Hotel | I saw Steven seeing him, and he didn't greet the Stevenes, even though he couldn't possibly have been unaware that the Stevenes were his aunt's friends! I thought about how disappointed Steven must be!\n[1897-06-11 08:29:23] Hotel | I thought about how Steven remembered Charles and the time between him and Paul, how Paul had been so kind to Steven, and I wondered if they were just ridiculous nobles, and perhaps there was a secret clause in the laws governing the noble class that allowed women and certain diplomats to avoid showing arrogance when interacting with commoners.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:28] Hotel | I thought the opposite: a young marquis had to show arrogance with an iron face.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:33] Hotel | I thought that Steven's wisdom could have told Steven the exact opposite of what was happening. But Steven was going through a ridiculous age—not completely ignorant, but rather an extremely productive one, an age characterized by not consulting wisdom at all, and by considering each human attribute as an inseparable part of their personality.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:38] Hotel | I thought that all around me were devils and gods, and I was never at peace. At that time, hardly anything I did was something I would later want to forget. On the contrary, it was regrettable that the natural, heartfelt sincerity which had prompted Steven's actions at that time was never to return.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:43] Hotel | I thought that in the future I would be more practical, completely in line with the rest of society, but youth was the only time when I actually learned anything.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:48] Hotel | I saw a tall, slender body that could not bend, with the head always held high and eyes expressionless. I thought of the arrogance of M. de Peter, which Steven had guessed at, and how this arrogance, with its unyielding heart, was confirmed by the way he carried himself every time he passed by Steven and his companions.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:53] Hotel | I realized that merely being expressionless wasn't enough—I had to be hostile, with no trace of the usual, vague respect people have for others' rights, even when those people don't know your great-aunt.\n[1897-06-11 08:29:58] Hotel | I thought it was precisely this subtle respect for others' rights that made Steven behave differently in front of an old woman than he did in front of a gas streetlamp.\n[1897-06-11 08:30:03] Hotel | I thought about how a few days ago Steven had imagined writing several very charming letters to himself, in order to show his affection; a person with a vivid imagination claims to represent the people, and is stirring them up with unforgettable speeches. Once this person loudly expresses his dreams, and the enthusiastic cries of imagination subside, he remains, as before, a great fool, still mediocre and obscure, far away from the enthusiasm of the parliament and the people.\n[1897-06-11 08:30:08] Hotel | I thought of the young man's icy demeanor, which was as far removed from that imagined letter as it was from the enthusiasm of the parliament and the people.\n[1897-06-11 08:30:13] Hotel | I thought of that arrogant and malicious person, whose very revealing appearance had made a terrible impression on Steven's mind.\n[1897-06-11 08:30:18] Hotel | I saw that he was trying hard to eliminate this bad impression, so Charles again spoke about her nephew—the son of one of Charles's nieces, a boy slightly older than Steven, who had an infinitely kind heart.\n[1897-06-11 08:30:23] Hotel | I thought it was incredible that there could be people who, regardless of the truth, would lend their kind hearts to such hard-hearted individuals, even if those people were polite to the famous people in their own circle! Steven was really impressed by that!",

    "text": "[1897-06-15 10:56:45] Narrow Road | I saw one day that Steven met them both on a narrow path, and she had no other choice but to introduce Steven to him.\n[1897-06-15 10:56:55] Narrow Road | I thought that this time, Charles, though indirectly, had added a definite element to the fundamental characteristics of her great-nephew's nature. Steven was already certain about those basic traits.\n[1897-06-15 10:57:00] Narrow Road | I saw him as if he hadn't heard someone mention a person's name in front of him, not a single muscle in his face twitching.\n[1897-06-15 10:57:10] Narrow Road | I saw no trace of the faintest human warmth in his eyes. I thought that from the ignorance and emptiness of his gaze, there only emerged an excessive exaggeration. Without that, his eyes would be completely lifeless, like a mirror with no soul.\n[1897-06-15 10:57:15] Narrow Road | I saw, and then those cruel eyes fixed on Steven. I thought I should greet Steven first, but before that, I wanted to find out more about Steven.\n[1897-06-15 10:57:20] Narrow Road | I thought of that sudden start, which was more like a muscular reflex than an intentional action.\n[1897-06-15 10:57:25] Narrow Road | I saw him keeping as much distance as possible between himself and Steven, stretching out his whole arm to reach far over and shake Steven's hand.\n[1897-06-16 06:05:26] Hotel | I saw that the next day he sent someone to deliver his business card to Steven. I thought that Steven believed there would at least be a duel.\n[1897-06-16 06:05:31] Hotel | I saw that he spoke only about literature with Steven, and after a long conversation, he declared that he very much wished to see Steven for several hours every day.\n[1897-06-16 06:05:36] Hotel | I thought, but during this visit, he showed no particular interest in spiritual matters. His favor toward Steven was quite different from his response the day before.\n[1897-06-16 06:05:41] Hotel | I saw that later, whenever someone introduced a person to Steven, he would always look like that. I thought to myself that Steven had understood, this was simply a social habit peculiar to a part of his family.\n[1897-06-16 06:05:46] Hotel | I knew that Robert placed great importance on his being very well-mannered, and she demanded that his body conform to this habit.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:06] Hotel | I greeted him without thinking about it, just as little as I thought about his beautiful clothes or his beautiful hair. I thought that this was something that didn't really mean anything in terms of thought, it was purely learned.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:11] Hotel | I saw that Steven, as usual with another of his habits, was the first to take notice of the matter: he would immediately ask to be introduced to the relatives of whoever he had just met.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:16] Hotel | I saw that this habit had become instinctive for him, so the next day, when the Stevenes met, he rushed toward Steven as soon as he saw him, without even asking how he was, and immediately demanded that Steven inform his grandmother of his name.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:21] Hotel | I thought of that frantic speed, as if the demand came from some inner instinct, just like the act of blocking a blow coming straight at you, or closing your eyes immediately when hot water sprays toward you. Without taking such protective measures, staying still for another second would mean life-threatening danger.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:26] Hotel | I thought that once this first exorcism ritual was completed, like an angry sorceress peeling off her first layer of clothing and adorning herself with seductive charm, this proud beauty that Steven had seen would become the most amiable and kind-hearted person Steven had ever met, the most attentive and considerate young man.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:31] Hotel | I thought, \"Well, Steven was wrong about him. Steven has been deceived by an illusion. But Steven has only gained a momentary advantage, since he's about to fall into the hands of another. After all, he's a man obsessed with the aristocracy, and he'll try hard to hide his true self.\"\n[1897-06-16 06:06:36] Hotel | I thought to myself that, indeed, Peter's entire good education and all his likable qualities would soon reveal to Steven another person, quite different from what Steven suspected.\n[1897-06-16 06:06:41] Hotel | I knew that this young man, who appeared to be an arrogant nobleman and athlete, valued only spiritual matters and was interested in them, especially in the fashionable expressions of literature and art. I thought that, in his great-aunt's eyes, must have seemed so ridiculous.\n[1897-06-17 14:54:42] Hotel | I knew that, in addition, his mind was full of what her great-aunt called \"socialist speeches,\" filled with deep contempt for his own class, and he often spent hours studying Unknown_Nietzsche and Proudhon.\n[1897-06-17 14:55:02] Hotel | I knew he would quickly admire those \"intellectuals\" who buried themselves in a book, concerned only with abstract thought.\n[1897-06-17 14:55:22] Hotel | I thought of this tendency as being expressed in such an abstract way that it placed him far away from the usual concerns of Steven, and even while he was expressing it, although Steven found it very moving, he also felt somewhat tired of it.\n[1897-06-17 14:55:27] Hotel | I thought that Steven could say, during those days when Steven had just read the anecdotal memoirs of the famous Count de Maussan, and when Steven had indeed learned that Count de Maussan was his James, Steven was especially eager to know more accurate and detailed information about Count de Maussan's past life.\n[1897-06-17 14:55:32] Hotel | I thought about Peter, who not only refused to be merely his father's son, but also failed to introduce Steven into the outdated novel of his father's life, instead cultivating his own love for Unknown_Nietzsche and Proudhon, which made Steven absolutely furious.\n[1897-06-17 14:55:37] Hotel | I knew that in Count de Paul, the refined and imaginative spirit of an already distant era had merged into one.\n[1897-06-17 14:55:57] Hotel | I know he was a clever man, one who had gone beyond the bounds of his playboy life. He hadn't had much time to get to know his son, but he wanted his son to be more successful than himself. I thought his James might not approve of Steven's regret.\n[1897-06-17 14:56:02] Hotel | I thought that Steven might believe he would, unlike other members of his family, appreciate his son, and be pleased that his son had abandoned the pitiful pastimes that had once occupied his father, in order to engage in serious thinking.\n[1897-06-17 14:56:07] Hotel | I thought he would quietly, with the humility of a great spiritual master, secretly read his son's favorite book to gauge just how much Peter was superior to him.\n[1897-06-17 14:56:12] Hotel | I knew that although Monsieur de Maussant had a broad mind, he could appreciate a son so different from himself. I thought of saying something else, another sad thing.\n[1897-06-17 14:56:17] Hotel | I know, but Peter believed that character was linked to certain artistic forms and ways of life. He had a memory of his father, filled with affection yet tinged with contempt; his father had spent his whole life obsessed with hunting, horse racing, yawned during Unknown_Wagner's music, and was passionately fond of Offenbach.\n[1897-06-17 14:56:22] Hotel | I thought Peter wasn't smart enough; he didn't understand that intellectual value had nothing to do with conforming to a certain aesthetic model. He looked down on the \"wisdom\" of de Méséglise, just as Bouvard's son might look down on Bouvard or Rabisch's son on Rabisch, because if these sons were devoted to the most symbolist literature and the most complex music, they would inevitably look down on their own James.",

    "text": "[1897-06-18 18:15:51] Hotel | \"I heard Peter often say, 'Steven knows very little about his father. It's said he was a very distinguished man. His misfortune was that he lived in a sad era. Born in the Saint-Germain district, living in the 'Helen of Beauty' era, that caused a lifetime of disaster.'\"\n[1897-06-18 18:15:56] Hotel | I heard someone say, \"If he were a petty bourgeois fond of the 'Ring,' he might have done something entirely different. People even told Steven that he loved literature. It's impossible to know for sure, because the literature he understood consisted entirely of outdated works.\"\n[1897-06-18 18:16:01] Hotel | I thought that for Steven, Peter seemed rather serious, yet he didn't understand that Steven was no more serious than he was.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:06] Hotel | I thought about how he judged everything only by the number of layers of wisdom it contained. Some things that gave Steven beautiful imaginations, he couldn't grasp and instead considered them shallow.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:11] Hotel | I thought that he considered Steven far inferior to himself, yet he was surprised that Steven could take interest in such matters.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:16] Hotel | At first, Peter had already won over Steven's David. I thought not only of how he showed his constant goodwill toward the two Stevenes with such skill, but also of how he added a naturalness to that goodwill, which he did in all matters.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:21] Hotel | I thought of nature—probably because, through the art of how he treated people, he made one feel nature—this was the quality that Steven's grandmother valued most, whether in the garden, in cooking, or in piano playing.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:26] Hotel | I know that in the garden, for example, in the garden of Sunrise, she disliked especially neat flowerbeds; in cooking, she hated so-called \"fancy dishes,\" foods that were almost unrecognizable in their composition; in piano playing, she disliked excessive refinement and over-polishing. She even had a special fondness for Rubinstein's playing when his notes were unclear or when he was slightly out of tune.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:31] Hotel | I thought of this naturalness, which she even sensed in Peter's attire—luxurious yet effortless, without the slightest trace of \"affectedness\" or \"formality and rigidity,\" not stiff, nor starched.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:36] Hotel | I thought she appreciated the young man's carefree and effortless manner, his life of luxury without any trace of greed or ostentation.\n[1897-06-18 18:16:41] Hotel | I saw Peter still unable to prevent his face from revealing some kind of passion. I thought that she even found this natural, moving quality in it.\n[1897-06-19 19:18:59] Hotel | I know that generally, as childhood passes, certain physiological characteristics of that age also disappear.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:19] Hotel | I saw, for example, how he eagerly anticipated something yet had no hope of receiving, not even a single compliment, and yet would suddenly burst into that sharp, fiery, infectious, and overt happiness, which he could neither control nor conceal.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:24] Hotel | I saw the lively, grotesque expression irresistibly flaring up on his face, the delicate skin of his cheeks flushed with red, and his eyes reflecting both shyness and joy. I thought of the infinite emotion that Steven's grandmother felt at this straightforward and innocent display of beauty.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:29] Hotel | I thought of that expression, which was not false in Peter, at least during the time when Steven was very close friends with him.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:34] Hotel | I thought of Steven knowing another person--there were many such people--for whom the fleeting flush of physiological sincerity did not exclude moral insincerity.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:39] Hotel | I thought of this flush, which often only proved the intensity of pleasure felt by people capable of the most despicable and treacherous actions, people who could not even control themselves in the face of happiness, and had to confess their joy to others.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:44] Hotel | I thought about why Steven's grandmother particularly loved Peter, and it was naturally because he so openly admitted his affection for Steven.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:49] Hotel | I thought about the words he used to express his liking, and Steven's grandmother said that even she couldn't find words more accurate and truly heartfelt, words that simultaneously belonged to \"Sévigné and Bocage.\"\n[1897-06-19 19:19:54] Hotel | I saw him making light-hearted fun of Steven's weaknesses without the least restraint--the careful way he picked at Steven's faults was amusing to Steven's grandmother--but it was also full of tenderness, just like Steven's grandmother's.\n[1897-06-19 19:19:59] Hotel | I saw the opposite; heenthusiastically, unreservedly, and without coldness praised Steven's virtues with genuine enthusiasm. I thought that, as young men of his age usually do, he felt he had to show off by means of restraint and aloofness.\n[1897-06-21 01:42:47] Hotel | I saw Steven feeling slightly unwell, and he would then call for someone; when the weather turned cold, Steven hadn't yet noticed, but he had already covered Steven's legs with a blanket; if he sensed that Steven was sad or unhappy, he would silently arrange to stay with Steven longer into the evening.\n[1897-06-21 01:42:52] Hotel | I saw him being so careful and considerate, and from Steven's health perspective, perhaps a stricter approach might actually be better for Steven. I thought that Steven's grandmother found it almost excessive, but as an expression of her affection for Steven, she was deeply moved.\n[1897-06-21 01:42:57] Hotel | I saw that Steven and the other Steven quickly came to an agreement: Steven and the other Steven had become lifelong friends who would never part.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:02] Hotel | When I saw him say \"the friendship of the Stevenes,\" it was as if he were speaking about some important and sweet thing that existed outside of the Stevenes themselves. I thought and soon he would refer to \"the friendship of the Stevenes\" as the greatest joy in his life--not counting his love for his mistress.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:07] Hotel | I thought of how these words would cause Steven some sadness. Steven was at a loss, unsure how to respond, because being with him, talking to him—surely, with anyone else as well—Steven felt no happiness that he might otherwise feel when alone.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:12] Hotel | I sometimes felt, when alone, a sensation rising from the depths of my being, a sweet pleasure that belonged to Steven.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:17] Hotel | I thought, but whenever Steven was with someone, whenever he talked to a friend, Steven's thoughts made a complete 180-degree turn, shifting toward the person he was talking to, rather than focusing on Steven himself.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:22] Hotel | I thought that when thinking took such a backward direction, it could not at all bring Steven any pleasure.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:27] Hotel | As soon as Steven left Peter, I used sentences to untangle every chaotic minute he had spent with me. I thought to myself that Steven was thinking, and that Steven had a friend, a true friend, which was rare, and that Steven felt surrounded by wealth that was hard to obtain.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:32] Hotel | I thought that at this moment, Steven was precisely experiencing something opposite to the happiness that was naturally his, something that took from within Steven's heart and brought that half-lit, half-shadowed thought into the open light.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:37] Hotel | I thought that if Steven spent two or three hours chatting with Peter, and if Peter said something that Steven greatly admired, Steven would then feel a certain regret, disappointment, and weariness, and would prefer being alone and ready to start working.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:42] Hotel | I thought, but Steven also thought to himself that a person's intelligence was not solely for his own benefit; even the greatest figures expected to be appreciated. Steven could not consider those few hours as wasted, because during that time he had built up a towering image in his friend's mind.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:47] Hotel | I thought that Steven could easily convince himself that he should be happy about it, precisely because Steven had never experienced this happiness, and thus Steven longed even more fervently to never be deprived of this happiness.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:52] Hotel | I thought about how, for the wealth outside of Steven's possession, people are always more worried about its disappearance than they are about any other kind of wealth, because Steven's heart does not possess it.\n[1897-06-21 01:43:57] Hotel | I thought of Steven, who felt he was able to better exemplify the virtue of friendship than many others (because Steven always placed his friends' interests above so-called personal interests, which he himself didn't care about, while others were very concerned about them).\n[1897-06-21 01:44:02] Hotel | I thought about the difference between Steven's mind and the minds of others--each Steven's mind is different from the others--but instead of growing, this difference would vanish, and Steven could not feel happy because of it.\n[1897-06-21 01:44:07] Hotel | I thought the opposite; sometimes, Steven's mind discerned in Peter a more ordinary man than the one himself—“nobility”—and just as an inner spirit commands the movements of his limbs, it was this \"nobility\" that governed all his actions.\n[1897-06-21 01:44:12] Hotel | I thought at that moment, although Steven was by his side, in reality Steven was alone, and Steven before him seemed like Steven facing a landscape, having understood the harmony of that scenery.\n[1897-06-21 01:44:17] Hotel | I thought to myself that he was nothing more than an object, and Steven's thoughts tried to deepen their understanding of this object.\n[1897-06-21 01:44:22] Hotel | I thought of how Steven always found in him that preconceived, elderly man, the one who was precisely the kind of nobleman Peter hoped he was not, and at this, Steven felt an intense happiness, but one belonging to the realm of intellect rather than friendship.\n[1897-06-21 01:44:27] Hotel | I saw that he was mentally and physically agile, endowing him with an infinite charm and loveliness.",

    "text": "[1897-06-22 12:17:47] Hotel | I saw him casually invite David to ride in his carriage and help her in; he was afraid Steven would catch a chill, so he skillfully jumped down from his seat and draped his own coat over Steven's shoulders.\n[1897-06-22 12:17:57] Hotel | I knew that what Steven felt from these actions was not just the skill passed down through generations of great hunters—the young man's ancestors had been hunters for generations, yet he was determined to pursue intellectual endeavors.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:02] Hotel | I thought of their disdain for wealth—the same disdain was present in Peter—but at the same time, he was very interested in wealth, only so that he could better entertain his friends. It was precisely this disdain that made him so carelessly offer his luxuries at his friends' feet.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:07] Hotel | I thought that from these actions, Steven felt even more the noblemen's sense of superiority or their illusion of being \"above others.\"\n[1897-06-22 12:18:12] Hotel | I was glad that they had not passed on to Peter that desire to appear \"just like everyone else,\" nor that fear of seeming overly attentive, which they had inherited.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:17] Hotel | I thought that Peter was entirely unaware of this fear, which, with its stiffness and awkwardness, turned even the friendliness of the most sincere common people into something grotesque.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:22] Hotel | Sometimes I reproached Steven for deriving pleasure from regarding his friends as works of art, that is, by watching the movements of each of his friend's parts as if they were guided by a single, harmonious idea, with each part attached to that central idea, though the person himself was unaware of what that idea was.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:27] Hotel | I thought that, therefore, this overall idea added nothing to his own qualities, to his personal wisdom and moral worth, which he valued so highly.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:32] Hotel | I thought, but in a way, this overall idea was the condition for his character to exist.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:37] Hotel | I thought that precisely because he was a nobleman, his inner thoughts and his yearning for socialism had a certain genuine and selfless quality about him.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:42] Hotel | I saw that this activity and his longing drove him to seek out some ambitious, poorly dressed young university students. I knew that the activities and aspirations of those people were not pure or selfless.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:52] Hotel | I thought of him as the inheritor of an ignorant and selfish social class, honestly hoping that the students would forgive him his noble origins.\n[1897-06-22 12:18:57] Hotel | I saw that the opposite was true: it was precisely these aristocratic roots that exerted an attraction on the university students, which is why they sought him out, while at the same time pretending to be indifferent, even arrogant, toward him.\n[1897-06-22 12:19:02] Hotel | I saw that he had gotten to the point of actively pursuing some people. I thought of Steven's parents, who were loyal to the sociology of Sunrise; they would have been astonished to see him not turn away from these people.\n[1897-06-23 15:51:49] Beach | I saw one day that Steven and Peter were sitting on the beach, back to a canvas tent. I saw the Stevenes hearing the curses coming from the tent, complaining that the Riverside Jews were too numerous and had made Riverside stink.\n[1897-06-23 15:51:59] Beach | \"I heard the voice say, 'There's no way to take a few steps without bumping into one!' 'Steven isn't driven by any principle or deep-seated hatred for the Jewish people, but here, it's simply excessive! All you hear is, 'Hey, Abraham, chai fu Chakop.' It really feels like I'm on Rue d'Aboukir!\"\n[1897-06-23 15:52:04] Beach | I saw the man who had been so furious against Israel finally emerge from the tent. The Stevenes looked up to see this anti-Semite. He was none other than Steven's companion, Richard.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:14] Beach | I saw Peter immediately ask Steven to remind Richard that they had met during the big exam. I know that Richard received an honor in that big exam, and later they met again at a people's university.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:24] Beach | I thought of one of Peter's like-minded friends who had made a mistake in social situations, done something ridiculous, and Peter didn't care at all. But he felt that if others found out, the person who had made the mistake would be embarrassed.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:29] Beach | I saw that at such times, the fear of hurting someone else's pride would make him look awkward. These moments were often when Peter would turn red in the face, as if he were the one who had made the mistake. I thought that Steven could find traces of the Jesuit education in his awkwardness, and Steven would only occasionally make a sarcastic remark about it.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:34] Beach | The situation was like that on the day I saw Richard agree to come to the hotel to see him.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:44] Beach | I heard Richard agree, but then added, \"Steven can't stand waiting in those big caravanserai-style hotels pretending to be fashionable; the Gypsy women make Steven sick. Tell them 'laift' and have them shut up immediately!\"\n[1897-06-23 15:52:49] Beach | I knew he wasn't alone in Riverside, but was with his sisters, which was a pity! His sisters had many relatives and friends here. I thought that, personally, Steven wasn't very insistent on having Richard come to the hotel.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:54] Beach | I knew that Riverside, like certain countries such as Russia and Rumania, was taught in geography classes to Stevens, where the Jewish population did not enjoy the same privileges as in Willowbrook, nor had they reached the same level of assimilation as in Willowbrook. I thought this Jewish group was quite distinctive, though not particularly pleasant.\n[1897-06-23 15:52:59] Beach | When I saw Richard's cousins and his uncles and aunts, or the men and women of the same faith as him, going to the amusement park, the women went to the \"dance hall,\" while the men took a different path toward the card gambling.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:09] Beach | I saw that they always went together, without mixing with any other elements. I thought of them as a group of people who were entirely like themselves, completely different from the people who watched them pass by every year without ever saying hello.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:14] Beach | I thought of the circles of Sunrise, the faction of the chief judge, the big and small bourgeoisie, even some ordinary grain merchants in Willowbrook, their daughters, beautiful, proud, mocking everything, thoroughly French, like the statues of Reims, none of them would be willing to mix with this group of unrefined girls.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:19] Beach | I saw them obsessed with the latest trend of \"sea bathing,\" even pretending they had just returned from catching big shrimp or were about to dance the tango.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:24] Beach | I saw that when it came to men, although their tailcoats were dazzling and their shoes brilliantly polished, their manner was affected and pretentious. I thought of those so-called \"clever\" details that painters come up with: they want to illustrate the Gospels or One Thousand and One Nights, taking into account the countries where those events took place, yet they end up giving the appearance of the most rotund \"important person\" from Riverside to Saint Peter or to Alibaba.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:29] Beach | I saw Richard, who introduced his sister to Steven, rudely ordering these girls to be quiet.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:39] Beach | I knew they worshipped their older brother completely, regarding him as their idol; whenever he said a witty remark, they would all burst into laughter.\n[1897-06-23 15:53:59] Beach | I thought that, probably, this class also contained many attractive qualities, excellent traits, and noble morals, just like any other class. To experience these, one had to go deep into the heart of this class.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:04] Beach | I thought, but this class was not likable; they sensed the atmosphere of anti-Semitism, saw its manifestations, and formed a dense, closed group to fight against it; no one could break through to enter this circle.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:09] Beach | I heard Richard ask Steven why he had come to Riverside, if he was \"hoping to meet some beautiful girls.\" I thought about the word \"laift,\" and this matter was less surprising to Steven than another event that had happened a few days earlier. On the contrary, he seemed to feel that his coming here was entirely natural.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:14] Beach | I heard Steven tell him that this trip was something Steven had long desired, yet it was still one level less than his desire to go to Oakdale.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:19] Beach | At this, he replied, \"Yes, of course, to pretend to be reading Sir John Ruskin's The Record while having ice cream with beautiful ladies. That Ruskin was a gloomy, repulsive fellow, one of the most annoying gentlemen in the world.\"\n[1897-06-23 15:54:24] Beach | I thought that Richard obviously believed that in England, not only are all men \"sirs,\" but the letter \"i\" is always pronounced as \"ai.\"\n[1897-06-23 15:54:29] Beach | I thought Peter didn't consider the pronunciation mistake serious, because he mainly saw in it that Steven, this new friend, lacked social awareness.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:34] Beach | I thought of Steven, this new friend, who had neither these notions nor any respect for them.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:39] Beach | I thought that Peter would be afraid that one day Richard found out people said \"Oakdale\" instead of \"Venezia,\" and that Ruskin was not a knight, and would then think Peter must have found him ignorant and ridiculous, which would make him feel guilty, as if he weren't generous enough, when in fact he was extremely generous.\n[1897-06-23 15:54:44] Beach | I thought that one day Richard would feel his cheeks flush with embarrassment when he discovered his mistake, but Peter had already felt it rising to his own face. He was certain that Richard took this mistake more seriously than he himself did.\n[1897-06-24 17:55:35] Beach | I realized this was exactly what had happened a few days later, when Richard heard Steven say \"lift.\" He immediately interrupted Steven and said, \"Ah, you should say 'lift.'\" I heard him speak at the same time in a stiff and proud tone: \"Actually, it's completely unimportant.\"\n[1897-06-24 17:55:40] Beach | I thought of this sort of response, which all people with strong sense of self-respect say, whether in the most important or the most trivial circumstances.\n[1897-06-24 17:55:45] Beach | I thought that this showed how, for the person who claimed it was unimportant, even in the most trivial circumstances, the thing that had been said was very important.\n[1897-06-24 17:55:50] Beach | \"I heard, 'Ah, well, it's completely unimportant, Steven can make other arrangements!'\" I thought of any proud person who, having just lost the last hope he had clung to, was refused help and would first utter this heartbreaking, tragic sentence.\n[1897-06-24 17:55:55] Beach | I thought of how the \"alternative arrangements\" I so carelessly pushed toward him sometimes turned out to be suicide.\n[1897-06-24 17:56:00] Hotel | I saw that later, Richard said some very enthusiastic things to Steven. I thought he certainly wanted to be very kind and affectionate toward Steven.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:15] Hotel | I heard him say, \"But he asked Steven: 'You're very close to Peter de Fairhaven, are you trying to elevate yourself into the nobility? — The noble class is pretty much the same as everyone else, you're too naive. You're probably caught up in the latest fashion craze. Tell Steven, are you a fashionably dressed young man? Yes, aren't you?'\"\n[1897-06-24 22:45:20] Hotel | I thought about what he had said, and it wasn't because some sudden desire to be polite toward Steven had changed, but rather because his shortcomings were precisely what people incorrectly call \"not well-educated\" in French.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:25] Hotel | I thought about how he was unaware of this flaw himself, and would never imagine that others might be upset or repelled by it.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:30] Hotel | I thought about how, in human beings, the proportion of virtues that everyone possesses is not greater than the numerous defects that each individual has. Obviously, the most common thing in the world is not conscience, but kindness.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:35] Hotel | I thought of how, in the most remote and secluded corners, people would be surprised to see the flower of goodness open by itself, like a peony blooming in a quiet valley.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:40] Hotel | I thought of this flower, which was no different from the peonies elsewhere in the world, but it had never seen any other peonies; it had only known the winds that sometimes made its lonely little red cap tremble.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:45] Hotel | I thought that even if this kindness became paralyzed by self-interest and could not be expressed, it still existed.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:50] Hotel | I thought of how this kindness would shine brightly whenever there were no selfish motives to hinder it, for instance when reading a novel or a newspaper. It would go toward the weak, the just, the oppressed, even a murderer, who as a lover of serial novels still had a soft heart. In such a person's heart, this kindness would also shine brightly.\n[1897-06-24 22:45:55] Hotel | I thought of how the variety of defects is just as astonishing as the admirable nature of virtues. The most perfect person has some flaw that is annoying or bothersome.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:00] Hotel | I thought of a person whose intelligence was exceptional and who had a far-sighted outlook, never saying anything bad about anyone. But when you personally gave him the most important letter to deliver, he put it in his pocket and forgot to give it to you, later causing you to miss an important appointment, and he didn't even smile and apologize, because he took pride in never knowing what time it was.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:05] Hotel | I thought of another person, sensitive and gentle in disposition, refined in his dealings with people. About you himself, he would only say things that would please you, but you sensed that he kept silent about certain matters, keeping some things buried deep within him, all sorts of things fermenting in his heart. He was very happy to see you, and he valued this happiness so much that he would rather have you exhausted than leave you.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:10] Hotel | I thought the third one was more sincere, but when you said you hadn't come to visit him because you weren't feeling well and asked for his forgiveness, he took sincerity to the point of making sure you knew that someone had seen you at the theater and that people thought you looked very well.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:15] Hotel | I thought that, in any case, you shouldn't let him know that he hadn't fully benefited from your mediation, and besides, three other people had already offered to take action on his behalf, so he was only slightly grateful to you.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:20] Hotel | I thought that in both cases, the friend in front might pretend not to know that you had gone to the theater, or that someone else could do him such a favor. As for this last friend, he felt the need to repeatedly tell or reveal to someone the most annoying thing possible, and he took great pride in his bluntness, insisting on saying: \"Steven is like that.\"\n[1897-06-24 22:46:25] Hotel | I thought of people who annoyed me by being either overly curious or utterly indifferent. You could talk to them about the most sensational events, and they wouldn't understand a thing.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:30] Hotel | I thought of people who take months to reply to your letter, especially if it's about something that doesn't concern them.",

You were afraid of missing their visit and didn't dare go out, but they never came, making you wait for weeks because they hadn't received your reply (their letters had never even asked you to reply), thinking they had made you angry.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:40] Hotel | I thought of certain people who, when they are happy, want to come see you. They only care about their own desire to do so, without considering whether you want to see them or not. They talk nonstop, never giving you a chance to speak, and they don't care if you have urgent things to do.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:45] Hotel | I thought, but if they feel it's been too long, if they get tired or in a bad mood, you won't be able to draw a single word out of them, no matter how hard you try. They'll respond with listlessness, refusing to answer you at all, not even with a single word, as if they hadn't heard a thing you said.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:50] Hotel | I thought about how each of Steven's friends had their own flaws, and in order to continue liking him, Steven had to find something to comfort himself—his talent, his kindness, his gentleness—or, more accurately, to fully appreciate the goodwill of his friends and ignore their shortcomings.\n[1897-06-24 22:46:55] Hotel | I thought it was a pity that Steven, like all others, made every effort to ignore the flaws of his friends, yet was always overcome by his own reckless indulgence, because he couldn't see his own faults, or else believed others couldn't see them either.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:00] Hotel | I realized that the danger of being annoying mainly comes from things that are hard to evaluate—things that are unobtrusive or unnoticed. Therefore, out of caution, one should never speak about oneself. It is certain that, on this subject, other people's opinions will never coincide with those of Steven himself.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:05] Hotel | I thought of how people, upon visiting a house that looked unremarkable from the outside, would feel the same astonishment whether its interior was filled with treasures or littered with thieves' crowbars or corpses—that is, when they discovered someone else's real life, the true world beneath the surface.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:10] Hotel | I thought about how each person's words about Stevens formed an image of them in the minds of the Stevenles. The surprise of the Stevenles when they learned, through the remarks made behind their backs, that people had completely different images of them and their lives would not have been any smaller than in the previous case.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:15] Hotel | I thought that, therefore, after each of the Stevenes had spoken about himself, they could be sure that the harmless and cautious words they had said, heard by others who politely and hypocritically pretended to agree, would lead to the most annoying or most pleasant remarks, in short, the most damaging ones.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:20] Hotel | I thought about how the disparity between Steven's thoughts and his words could really annoy people. Such a discrepancy always made people seem very ridiculous when they spoke, like those fake music lovers who pretended to be extremely appreciative, but the words they used to descri be Steven's work didn't really convey their admiration.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:25] Hotel | I thought how they compensated for their mumbled, incoherent speech by using expressive gestures and looks of heartfelt admiration, while at the same time feeling the need to hum a tune they loved.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:30] Hotel | I thought of another bad habit, which is closely linked to the first one of talking about oneself and one's own flaws: that is, pointing out a flaw in someone else, which happens to be the very same flaw that I myself have. People always talk about these flaws, as if they were talking about themselves, but actually, they are using an indirect way to combine the pleasure of acknowledging their own faults with the pleasure of forgiving themselves.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:35] Hotel | I thought that, in addition, Steven's attention was always drawn to the things that made up Steven's own characteristics, and compared to other things on others, these were easier to notice.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:40] Hotel | I heard someone with poor eyesight say about another person: \"His eyes are almost shut.\" I thought of a tuberculosis patient who always doubts whether the lungs of the strongest person are healthy; a very dirty person who always says others don't bathe; a person with a poor sense of smell who always thinks others smell bad; a husband, whose own wife is immoral, sees everywhere husbands whose wives are immoral; a flirtatious woman sees flirtatious women everywhere; a young man chasing fashion sees fashionable youths everywhere.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:45] Hotel | I thought that each flaw, like each profession, requires a specific kind of knowledge, and that one constantly develops this specialized knowledge. To show off such knowledge is not at all annoying.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:50] Hotel | I thought of people with inverted desires, those who find others with inverted desires. A tailor was invited to a social gathering, and before even speaking to you, he had already begun evaluating the fabric of your clothes, his fingers eager to touch and test its quality.\n[1897-06-24 22:47:55] Hotel | I thought that if you were to talk with a dentist for a while and then ask him what he really thought of you, he would tell you how many bad teeth you had. To him, nothing was more important than that. And once you discovered his own bad teeth, you would find nothing more ridiculous.\n[1897-06-24 22:48:00] Hotel | I thought that not only do Steven and others believe that everyone else is blind when they talk about themselves, but even when Steven and others act, they seem to think that others are blind. For each Steven, there is a special God who is always present, concealing each Steven's flaws or promising not to see them.\n[1897-06-24 22:48:05] Hotel | I thought of how, like someone who doesn't bathe, he would close his eyes and plug his nose at the sight of a speck of dirt on their ears or the smell of sweat in their armpits, and he would make them believe they could wander about in the world with all that dirt and sweat, suffering no punishment, and that no one would notice. Those who wore fake pearls or gave fake pearls as gifts thought others would surely take them for real ones.\n[1897-06-24 22:48:10] Hotel | I knew that Richard was rude, mentally unstable, and fashion-conscious, from an undignified family, bearing an immeasurable pressure like being at the bottom of the sea. This pressure came not only from the Christians on the surface, but also from the layers of Jewish society above him, each layer oppressing the one directly beneath it with its own contempt.\n[1897-06-24 22:48:15] Hotel | I thought of how, for Richard, it might take thousands of years to rise from one Jewish family to another, passing through layer after layer until he could finally breathe free air. It would be best to try to find an exit from the other side.\n[1897-06-25 14:58:45] Hotel | I saw Richard telling Steven that Steven was caught up in the frenzy of fashion, and that Steven should admit he was a dandy. Steven could have replied to him: \"If I were, I wouldn't be seeing you so often.\" I heard that Steven had only told him that he was speaking too rudely.\n[1897-06-25 14:58:50] Hotel | I saw that he wanted to apologize. I thought that people without education are truly fortunate, for according to their way, they both destroy their own words and at the same time seek to make those words heavier.\n[1897-06-25 14:58:55] Hotel | \"I heard him say, 'Please forgive Steven,' and now he says this every time he meets Steven. 'Steven made you sad, he tormented you, Steven did it on purpose. But—overall, all people, individually, your friends, are strange creatures—you can't imagine that although Steven so cruelly mocked you, he had a deep tenderness for you in his heart. When Steven thinks of you, this tenderness often makes him cry.\"\n[1897-06-25 14:59:00] Hotel | I saw him speaking, and then someone heard a sob.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:05] Hotel | I had heard that this young man was very picky, and about some of the most fashionable authors, he would often say, \"This man is a gloomy fool, that one is completely an idiot.\" I thought that what astonished Steven about Richard was not only his inappropriate behavior, but even more so the great variation in the quality of his conversation.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:10] Hotel | Sometimes he could speak with great delight about some utterly unamusing anecdotes, quoting the words of a completely ordinary person, saying, \"That man was really remarkable.\" I was continually amazed by the double scales with which people judge the wisdom, value, and meaning of others, until the day Steven met his James Richard, and this mystery was finally solved.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:15] Hotel | I never thought that Steven would one day agree to meet Richard. Because Richard had spoken ill of Steven in front of Peter, and had also spoken ill of Peter in front of Steven.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:20] Hotel | I heard him specifically tell Peter that Steven had been dying to be fashionable. \"Yes, yes, he's very honored to have met Monsieur Thomas.\" he said. Richard spoke the word in two parts, both to express irony and to add a literary touch.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:25] Hotel | I was astonished to hear that Peter had never heard of Thomas: \"Who is this man?\"\n[1897-06-25 14:59:30] Hotel | \"I see, he's a remarkable man,\" Richard answered, laughing heartily, and, as if afraid of the cold, put his hands into the pockets of his coat. I thought for sure he was now admiring the distinctive appearance of an outstanding provincial gentleman.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:35] Hotel | I thought that compared to this gentleman, the appearance of Barbe-Dolivet was nothing more than a minor figure in comparison. Richard would not have described the image of M. Thomas, but he would console himself by giving him several \"Le\"s and by savoring the name as one might taste wine hidden behind a stack of hay. However, such subjective enjoyment could not be appreciated by others.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:40] Hotel | I saw him speaking ill of Steven to Peter, and at the same time saying just as much bad things about Peter to Steven. The next day, both Steven and Peter found out the full details of these slanders, not because they had repeated them to each other, which would have been a serious sin on their part.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:45] Hotel | I saw him pull Peter aside and confess to him that he had deliberately spoken ill of him. I thought about it, but Richard would have found it very natural and almost inevitable, so in his anxious state—he believed that the Stevenes would inevitably learn what they needed to know from someone or another—he preferred to act first.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:50] Hotel | I told Peter, and he swore in the name of the guardian of oaths, the son of Cronus, Zeus, that he loved Peter and was willing to give his life for him, then wiped away a tear.\n[1897-06-25 14:59:55] Hotel | I saw that on the same day, he had also arranged a private meeting with Steven, confessed to him, and claimed that he had done so for Steven's own good, because he believed that certain social connections were harmful to Steven, and that Steven \"was worth more than that.\" Then, like a drunk man overcome by emotion, he seized Steven's hand, although his drunkenness was purely neurotic.\n[1897-06-25 15:00:00] Hotel | \"I heard him say, 'Trust Steven, for if you had thought of me yesterday, of Sunrise, of Steven's boundless tenderness for you, of certain afternoons in class that you can't even remember anymore, Steven didn't cry all night and have the demon Kael immediately take Steven away, making Steven cross through the gate of Hades, which people hate! Yes, all night, Steven swears to you! But Steven knows, Steven understands people, Steven knows you don't believe Steven's words.'\"\n[1897-06-26 03:44:55] Hotel | I thought, indeed, that Steven didn't believe a word of it, that Steven sensed these words were hastily made up, improvised as they were spoken. His oath \"in the name of Caius\" carried little weight, because Richard's belief in ancient Greek religion was purely literary in nature.\n[1897-06-26 03:45:00] Hotel | I thought that, in addition, whenever he became excited and also wanted others to be moved by a fictitious fact, he always said, \"Steven swears to you.\" It was less about making people believe he was telling the truth than about the hysterical pleasure of lying. What he said to Steven, Steven did not believe.\n[1897-06-26 03:45:05] Hotel | I thought that Steven wouldn't blame him, because Steven had inherited from Robert and David the nature of not holding a grudge, not even for much greater offenses. Steven also inherited the nature of never blaming anyone.\n[1897-06-26 03:45:10] Hotel | I thought that saying Richard wasn't absolutely a bad boy, he was capable of doing very passionate things.\n[1897-06-26 03:45:15] Hotel | I thought about how, since the Sunrise race, that is, the race that produced people as perfectly flawless as Steven's grandmother and Steven's mother, seemed to be on the verge of complete extinction, Steven could only choose between two types of people: the uncultivated, indifferent, and faithfully honest ones—people whose voices, as soon as they spoke, revealed they didn't care at all about your life—and another kind of person.\n[1897-06-26 03:45:20] Hotel | I thought of this latter kind of people, who understand you, love you, and are moved to tears as long as they are by your side. But after a few hours, they can turn on you, playing a cruel and heartless joke. Later, they will return to your side again, still skillful at reading your expressions, warm and charming, and immediately able to merge with you once more.\n[1897-06-26 03:45:25] Hotel | I thought that, by comparison, Steven might still prefer the latter type of person, and even if he didn't like their moral values, he at least enjoyed being with them.\n[1897-06-27 09:38:06] Hotel | \"I can't imagine the torment Steven feels when he misses you,\" Richard said again, \"in the end, it's yet another Jewish aspect of Steven coming to the surface.\"\n[1897-06-27 09:38:11] Hotel | I saw him add, with a sarcastic remark, while squinting his eyes as if he were trying to quantify the extremely small amount of \"Jewish blood\" under a microscope. I thought of a French nobleman who, among his entirely Christian ancestors, could also include Samuel Bernard or even further back, the Virgin Mary. He might have said something like that (though in reality he wouldn't have). It is said that the Levy family claimed to be descendants of the Virgin Mary.\n[1897-06-27 09:38:16] Hotel | I heard him say, \"Steven quite likes taking this part out of Steven's feelings, and after all, it's a small part, perhaps part of Steven's Jewish heritage.\" He added.\n[1897-06-27 09:38:21] Hotel | I thought about how he had said that, because he felt that revealing the truth about his race was both clever and honest. At the same time, in the same situation, he somehow managed to lighten the weight of that truth, like those determined to pay their debts but only brave enough to repay half of them.\n[1897-06-27 09:38:26] Hotel | I thought of summoning the courage to reveal the truth, while at the same time mixing in many lies that distorted the truth. This method of deception is more widespread than people generally imagine, even among those who usually don't do it: there are certain critical moments in life, especially in matters of love, which provide them with such opportunities.",

    "text": "[1897-06-27 09:38:31] Hotel | I saw Richard secretly denouncing Steven to Peter, and secretly denouncing Peter to Steven, all of it ending with an invitation for Steven and his friends to come visit. I thought that if one were to say that Richard had not at first tried to invite Peter alone, Steven would certainly not believe it. It seemed very likely that such an attempt had been made, but it had not succeeded.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:10] Hotel | I heard that one day Richard said to Steven and Peter, \"Dear elder brother, and you too, Armand and the beloved knight, the horse trainer, of the Amsbury family, since Steven met you near the tent of the Morny family, who travel by flying boat, on the noisy foam-strewn shore of Amphitrite, would the two of you be so kind as to come for dinner at Steven's renowned and upright James's house any day this week?\"\n[1897-06-27 14:57:15] Hotel | I thought about how he had extended this invitation to Steven and others, because he very much wanted to establish a closer relationship with Peter, hoping that Peter would help him gain entry into the aristocracy.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:20] Hotel | I thought that if this wish had been raised by Steven himself, it would have seemed to Richard like a thoroughly disgusting display of pretentiousness. This was entirely in line with Richard's view of one aspect of Steven's nature, at least up to now, he did not consider this to be the main aspect of Steven's character.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:25] Hotel | I thought that the same hope, raised from him, would be seen as a sign of his keen intellectual curiosity. He was eager to mix with social classes different from his own, perhaps finding something useful for literature in the process.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:30] The Bloch's house | When I saw my son tell Richard that he was bringing a friend to dinner, speaking with a slightly sarcastic and self-satisfied tone as he announced the friend's title and name—\"the Marquis de Peter of Ambres\"—Mr. Richard felt a strong tremor.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:35] The Bloch's house | I heard him shouting, \"Marquis d'Peter de Fairhaven! Oh! Damn it!\" I thought that, for him, using abusive language was the highest form of respect for a person.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:40] The Bloch family's home | I saw him cast a praising glance at his son: the son had managed to make friends with such a person! I thought the look meant: \"He really is a surprise. This prodigal son, is he Steven's child?\"\n[1897-06-27 14:57:45] The Bloch's house | I thought of how this gaze made Steven's companion extremely happy, just like adding fifty francs a month to his allowance.\n[1897-06-27 14:57:50] The Bloch's house | I knew that Richard felt uncomfortable at home, as if James regarded him as someone who had gone astray, since he lived by idolizing Léautaud, Hérédia, and other \"idle men.\"\n[1897-06-27 14:57:55] The Bloch's house | I know, but he's become friends with Peter from Ambres, whose father was chairman of the Suez Canal Company! (Oh! Damn it!) I thought to myself that this was an \"undisputed\" achievement!\n[1897-06-27 14:58:00] The Bloch's house | I know that because they were afraid of breaking the stereoscope, they left it in Willowbrook, and now people feel even more regretful. Only RichardJames had mastered the art of using the stereoscope, at least he had the right to use it.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:05] The Bloch's house | I knew that he would rarely use it, and when he did, he would be very careful, only on the days when distinguished guests arrived for a grand banquet. I thought that the people watching the stereopticon show felt it was a special privilege, an honor reserved for important guests; and the host who organized the performance gained authority, similar to the authority of a genius. Even if the landscape photographs were taken by Mr. Richard himself, and the device was his own invention, his authority could not have been any higher.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:10] The Bloch's house | \"I heard people talking at home, 'Didn't you get invited to the Solomon's yesterday?' 'No, Steven wasn't noticed by thediscerning eye! What's going on?' 'It was a big show, a stereopticon, the whole thing.' 'Ah, if there was a stereopticon, Steven would be sorry. It's said that when Solomon showed it off, it was quite unusual.'\"\n[1897-06-27 14:58:15] The Bloch's house | \"I don't know what to do!\" Mr. Richard said to his son. \"You shouldn't give him everything at once, because then he'll always be wanting something else.\"\n[1897-06-27 14:58:20] The Bloch's house | I thought about appealing to paternal love and wanted to move his son, and indeed he did think about getting that device. But \"specific time\" was lacking, or more accurately, people thought time was lacking.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:25] Hotel | I saw that the Stevenes had to postpone dinner because Peter couldn't leave; he was waiting for an uncle who was coming to Charles and would stay for forty-eight hours. I knew my uncle was very fond of physical exercise, especially long walks. He would come on foot from the castle where he was staying in the countryside, spending the night at a farm, so it was uncertain when he would arrive in Riverside.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:30] Hotel | I saw Peter couldn't move, and the telegrams that Steven's friend sent every day to his mistress were even entrusted to Steven to send from the telegraph office in Engenville.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:35] Hotel | I knew the uncle they were waiting for was named Balamède, a name he had inherited from his ancestor, the Prince of Sicily.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:40] Hotel | I know that later, when Steven was reading historical works, he came across this name--some say it is an ancient name--belonging to the chief administrator of certain cities in medieval Italy and southern France, or the head of a particular church, a stylish emblem of the Renaissance.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:45] Hotel | I knew this name had remained in the family, passed down from generation to generation, from the Vatican office all the way to Steven's uncle, a friend of Steven's.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:50] Hotel | I thought of people who, because they lacked money, couldn't establish a museum of honors or an art gallery, so they turned instead to ancient names (place names, like an old map, a knight's portrait, a signboard, or the name of an ordinary person, all carrying both documentary significance and local color; names from baptism, echoing in the beautiful French syllables at the end of words, making it obvious that the speaker had some kind of speech impediment. The vulgar tone of a local population, with their incorrect pronunciation—Steven's ancestors had indeed made lasting changes to Latin and Saxon words, and these changes later became the great lawmakers of grammar). In short, by means of these collections of ancient sounds, these people gave themselves concerts, just like those people who go around collecting old bass viols and lyras in order to play the music of the past on these ancient instruments.\n[1897-06-27 14:58:55] Hotel | I thought about how Steven would feel when he read the name, experiencing the same kind of joy that those people had felt.\n[1897-06-27 14:59:00] Hotel | I know that Peter told Steven that even within the most exclusive aristocratic circles, his uncle Baramond remained distinctively difficult to approach, disdainful of everything, and wholly engrossed in his own aristocratic lineage.\n[1897-06-27 14:59:05] Hotel | I know he was with his sister-in-law and several other carefully chosen people, forming what is called the \"Phoenix Circle.\" It was within this small group that he was so arrogant and terrifying that there had been incidents where someone from society, wanting to get to know him, tried to approach his own brother, only to be refused.\n[1897-06-27 14:59:10] Hotel | \"I heard, 'No, no, don't ask Steven to introduce you to his brother Baramond. Steven's wife, all of Steven's people, have tried their best but couldn't do anything. Otherwise, you would run into him and he would be rude, and Steven doesn't want that.'\"\n[1897-06-27 14:59:15] Hotel | I know that at the The Union, he and a few friends had designated two hundred club members, and he never allowed anyone to introduce these members to themselves. At the Samuel's house, he was known by the nickname \"Prince\" because of his flamboyant attire and haughty nature.\n[1897-06-27 14:59:20] Hotel | I saw Peter talking to Steven about his late uncle's youthful days. I knew that he, along with his two friends, who were just as handsome as him, shared a small bachelor apartment. Every day, he brought some women to the apartment, and thus they were called the \"Three Graces.\"\n[1897-06-27 14:59:25] Hotel | \"I heard him say, 'One day, a man—according to Unknown_Balzac, this man is now the most prominent person in Saint-Germain, but in his early, unlucky days, he showed strange and inexplicable tastes—he asked Steven's uncle to move into this apartment.'\"\n[1897-06-27 14:59:30] Hotel | \"I heard that as soon as he arrived, he started making advances—not to a woman, but to Steven's uncle Balade. Uncle Steven pretended not to understand and made an excuse to take the two friends out. Then they came back together, caught the scoundrel, stripped him naked, beat him until he was covered in blood, and kicked him out into the freezing cold of ten degrees below zero.\"\n[1897-06-27 14:59:35] Hotel | I heard that when they found him, he was half-dead, and as a result, the court came to investigate. That poor fellow barely managed to get the court to stop the investigation. Today, Steven's uncle probably won't ever do something so cruel again.\n[1897-06-27 14:59:40] Hotel | I heard him say, \"He was so arrogant toward the upper class, but you can't imagine how many common people he now has warm friendships with, protecting them even when he's repaid with ingratitude. A servant who once worked in his household, he'll get a position for him in Willowbrook. A farmer, he'll have someone teach him a trade. That's one of the more likable sides of him, in sharp contrast to his playboy side.\"\n[1897-06-27 14:59:45] Hotel | I thought of Peter, who indeed belonged to that kind of young man in the upper class, whose position made it possible to say of him: \"He has a considerable amount of likable qualities, a likable side.\" This was a valuable seed that would soon produce a way of dealing with people. In this way, others were worth nothing, and \"the common people\" became everything. In short, it was the exact opposite of the pride of the common people.\n[1897-06-27 14:59:50] Hotel | I heard someone say, \"It's said that when he was young, he was the model for his entire social class. What he said went without question; it's hard to imagine. Whatever he thought was most enjoyable and most advantageous, he did, but then people who were trying to be cultured immediately started imitating him.\"\n[1897-06-27 14:59:55] Hotel | I heard that \"in the theater, he was very thirsty and had someone bring drinks to the back of his box. By the next week, every small sitting room behind the boxes was filled with cool drinks. One summer, when it rained constantly and he suffered from rheumatism, he had a soft and warm camel's hair coat made, just as a travel blanket, and he never even moved the blue and orange stripes on it. Immediately, the top tailors saw their customers coming to order blue woolen coats with tassels.\"\n[1897-06-27 15:00:00] Hotel | I heard that \"he spent a day in a certain castle, and if for some reason he wished to avoid the formality of a dinner, he would not wear a suit, but instead arrive in his lounge jacket to indicate this subtle difference; thus, it became fashionable for people in the country to attend dinners in ordinary lounge jackets.\"\n[1897-06-27 15:00:05] Hotel | I heard that, in order to eat a piece of pastry, he didn't use a small spoon but instead used a fork or some other utensil he had specially made by a goldsmith, and after that he was no longer allowed to eat any other way. He wanted to hear certain quartets by Beethoven again (his ideas were certainly not foolish, but rather very clever), so he invited some artists over to play for him and a few friends every week. Thus, during that year, gathering a small number of people to listen to chamber music became the most refined thing of all.\n[1897-06-27 15:00:10] Hotel | \"I heard that Steven believed he had never experienced any boredom in his life. With his good looks back then, he must have had plenty of women! But Steven couldn't tell you exactly who they were, because he was a man of few words. However, Steven knew that he had certainly deceived his poor aunt quite a bit! Still, that didn't stop him from being very happy with her, as she adored him completely. After his aunt's death, he cried for years. Even when he was in Willowbrook, he almost went to the cemetery every day.\"\n[1897-06-27 21:17:07] Hotel | I saw Peter waiting for his uncle while talking to Steven. I knew the outcome was a waste of time.",

I thought that Steven felt someone watching him not far away from Steven.\n[1897-06-28 03:19:22] In front of the amusement park | I saw Steven turn his head away. I saw Steven see a man in his forties, tall and quite fat, with a thick black mustache.\n[1897-06-28 03:19:32] In front of the amusement park | I saw him, nervously tapping his trousers with a small cane, while staring intently at Steven with wide-open eyes.\n[1897-06-28 03:19:42] In Front of the Fairground | I saw Steven, whose eyes, extremely flexible, would sometimes roll about in their sockets. I thought that a person would have such an expression only when standing before a stranger, a stranger who, for some reason, would make you think thoughts that others—like a madman or a spy—would not.\n[1897-06-28 03:19:47] In front of the amusement park | I saw him send an exquisite glance toward Steven, bold yet cautious, quick yet profound, like a final look cast while fleeing.\n[1897-06-28 03:19:57] In front of the amusement park | I saw him glance around, then suddenly adopt an air of careless indifference and hauteur, and in a single movement he turned his body to look at a poster.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:07] In front of the amusement park | I saw him intently looking at the poster, humming a tune, and adjusting the moss rose that hung in his buttonhole.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:17] In front of the amusement park | I saw him take out a notebook from his pocket, as if writing down the names of plays in it.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:27] In front of the amusement park | I saw him take out his watch two or three times, pull down the brim of his flat black hat over his eyes, then put his hand on top of the hat to lengthen the brim, as if to see if anyone was coming.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:37] In front of the amusement park | I saw him make an unsatisfactory gesture. I thought that through this action, one could see that he had already grown tired of waiting.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:42] In front of the amusement park | I thought that if one really was waiting for someone, one would never make such a move.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:47] In front of the amusement park | I saw him then push his hat back from his forehead. I saw the brush-cut head, but both sides still had long, curved pigeon wings.\n[1897-06-28 03:20:57] In front of the amusement park | I saw him let out a loud breath. I thought that when people are not only very hot but also want to show they can't stand the heat, they breathe like that.\n[1897-06-28 03:21:02] In front of the amusement park | I thought of Steven, and suddenly realized that this was a hotel swindler. He might have noticed Steven and his grandmother a few days ago and was planning to take advantage of them, but just now, when he was eyeing Steven, he had been caught by Steven himself.\n[1897-06-28 03:21:07] In front of the amusement park | I thought that in order to deceive Steven, he might try to adopt this new posture, making a great effort to appear indifferent and uninterested.\n[1897-06-28 03:21:12] In front of the amusement park | I thought that he was being too exaggerated, almost confrontational, as if his goal wasn't just to dispel any suspicion Steven might have, or to take revenge on Steven for any insults he might have unwittingly given him, but to make Steven understand that he hadn't even seen Steven, and that Steven was such an unimportant person that he couldn't possibly have attracted his attention.\n[1897-06-28 03:21:17] In front of the amusement park | I saw him adopt the posture of a brave man, standing straight, puckering his lips, lifting his mustache, and in his eyes adding something utterly indifferent, harsh, and almost insulting. I thought of the outcome, his strange expression that made Steven sometimes see him as a thief and sometimes as a madman.\n[1897-06-28 03:21:22] In front of the amusement park | I saw, but Steven noticed his dress was extremely refined, far more serious and simple than the attire of any of the sea-bathers he had seen in Riverside. I felt relieved that the one called Steven was wearing a suit, because the bright, glaring, and vulgar colors of their seaside clothes often made Steven's suit look ridiculous.\n[1897-06-28 08:05:08] Near the hotel | I saw that at this moment Steven's grandmother came to meet Steven, and they walked around together.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:01] In front of the hotel | An hour later, she went back to the hotel for a short while, and Steven was waiting for her at the hotel entrance.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:11] In front of the hotel | I saw that at this moment Steven saw Charles and Peter, and the stranger who had stared so intently at Steven in front of the casino, walking out together.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:21] In front of the hotel | I saw his gaze, just like when Steven had first seen him, flashing quickly across Steven's body. I thought, and then, just as if he hadn't seen Steven at all, he drew his gaze back down to a point slightly below his eyes, dull and neutral, pretending not to see anything on the surface, and not seeing anything inside either.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:26] In front of the hotel | I thought that this look merely meant opening one's eyes wide, spreading one's eyelashes, and feeling satisfied with the presence of lashes around oneself. It was the pious and intoxicated gaze of certain hypocrites, the self-important look of certain fools.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:31] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven, who had already changed his clothes. Now he was wearing a darker jacket. I thought that this was obviously because true elegance is somewhat closer to simplicity than false elegance.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:36] In front of the hotel | I thought, but there was something else: closer to people, one feels that the reason these clothes had almost no other colors wasn't because the person who had eliminated the color was indifferent to it, but rather, more accurately, because for some reason, he had forbidden himself from using color.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:41] In front of the hotel | I thought that the simplicity of these garments seemed to come from obedience to some rule, rather than from a lack of appetite for color.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:46] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven noticing the dark green silk in the fabric of the trousers, which harmonized very well with the pattern on the socks. I thought of the powerful influence of that refined aesthetic which revealed a uniform preference for dark colors, and in the spirit of tolerance, I made only this single concession to that taste.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:51] In front of the hotel | I saw a red spot on the tie. I thought that being audacious was difficult to detect.\n[1897-06-28 08:21:56] In front of the hotel | \"I heard, 'How are you? Steven is here to introduce you to Baron de Fairhaven, Steven's nephew.' Charles said to Steven.\"\n[1897-06-28 08:22:01] In front of the hotel | I saw the stranger not looking at Steven, muttering some vague \"honored,\" followed immediately by \"Oh, oh, oh.\" I thought of giving his kindness a somewhat forced meaning.\n[1897-06-28 08:22:06] In front of the hotel door | I saw him curl his little finger, thumb, and index finger, then pass his middle finger and ring finger to Steven, neither of which had a ring on them.\n[1897-06-28 08:22:16] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven holding the two fingers through his Swedish gloves. Then, without lifting his eyes to Steven, he turned toward Charles.\n[1897-06-28 08:22:26] In front of the hotel | \"I heard 'Oh, Steven has gone out of his mind?' the lady said with a smile, 'Steven called you Baron de Fairhaven! Steven introduced you to the Baron de Charlus. Anyway, this mistake isn't too serious,' she added, 'after all, you really do have the name Fairhaven!' \"\n[1897-06-28 08:22:31] In front of the hotel | At that moment, Steven's grandmother came out, and Steven and his group set off together.\n[1897-06-28 12:19:13] Walking path | I saw Peter's uncle not only refused to say a single word to Steven, but even didn't glance at Steven.",

    "text": "[1897-06-28 12:19:23] On the walk | I saw that although he scrutinized strangers—on this brief walk, he cast a couple of menacing and penetrating glances at some utterly insignificant, lowly-born passersby as a test—he never once looked at people he knew. I thought that if we took Steven's judgment into account—that was like a detective carrying out a secret mission, keeping his friend outside the scope of his professional surveillance.\n[1897-06-28 12:19:28] On the walk | I saw Steven letting his grandmother, Charles, and him chat away, keeping Peter in the background. I heard \"Tell Steven, did Steven not hear? Charles told your uncle that he used to be a member of the Fairhaven family.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:19:33] On the way for a walk | I heard, \"Yes, of course, he's Barbe-Belamy de Fairhaven.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:19:38] Walking route | I heard, \"There's a castle near Sunrise, whose owner claims to be a descendant of Geneviève de Brabant. Is he related to the family with the name Goulmard?\"\n[1897-06-28 12:19:43] On the way for a walk | \"I heard him say, 'Absolutely right: Uncle Steven, no one is more knowledgeable about heraldry than he is. He would tell you that the 'shout' and 'battle cry' of the Stevenes were first 'Sunrise men,' and later became 'the King of Passa.' \" He smiled. \"The current owner of this castle is his brother.\" I thought of not wanting to appear proud of this \"shout\" that was a privilege, for only almost royal families and leaders of major factions had such a \"shout.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:19:48] On the way for a walk | I knew that Charles thus became closely related to the Fairhaven family.\n[1897-06-28 12:20:08] On the walk | I know, but for Steven, she had remained for a long time the lady who had given Steven a box of chocolates with a duck on it when he was a child, and at that time, she was more distant from the Fairhaven side than from the Méséglise side. I thought that, in Steven's eyes, I was not as distinguished or socially prominent as the optician in Sunrise.\n[1897-06-28 12:20:13] On the way for a walk | I thought that now, she had suddenly increased in value, and in parallel, other items owned by Steven had unexpectedly lost value. Whether it was an increase or a decrease, both were introducing numerous changes, just like Ovid's transformations, into various parts of Steven's childhood and the remnants of his childhood.\n[1897-06-28 12:20:18] Walk on the way | I heard, \"Is it true that there are all the busts of high-ranking officials from the Fairhaven family in this castle?\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:23] Walking path | I saw Peter speaking sarcastically. I heard, \"Yes, it's a fine view. Let's talk, don't tell anyone: Steven finds all this utterly dull.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:28] On the walk | \"I heard him say, 'But there's more interesting things at Fairhaven! That's the portrait of Steven's aunt by Gérard, it's very moving. As beautiful as Whistler's or Velázquez's works,' Peter added again.\" I thought of him, caught up in his Protestant fervor, and how he could not always accurately grasp the great measure.\n[1897-06-28 12:20:33] On the way for a walk | \"I heard that there's also a touching painting by Gustave Moreau. Steven's aunt is your friend, the niece of Charles, who was raised by this lady, and she married her cousin, who is also the nephew of Madame de Charles, the current Baron Samuel.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:38] Walking route | I heard, \"Then what is your uncle?\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:43] Walk on the way | \"I heard that his noble title was Monsieur de Charlus. According to the rules, when Steven's maternal uncle Barbe-Durand's father died, Steven's uncle Barbe-Durand should have inherited the title of Prince de Montmorency. Before he became Samuel of Fairhaven, his older brother had that title. In this family, changing names and identities was as easy as changing a shirt.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:48] Walking path | I heard him say, \"But Uncle Steven has some peculiar ideas about all these things. He thinks titles like Samuel in Italy and those Spanish honorifics are overused. Although he could choose from a half-dozen princely titles, he kept the title of Monsieur de Charlus as an act of protest, which on the surface seemed very modest, but actually contained a great deal of pride.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:53] Walking route | I heard him say, \"Nowadays everyone is a prince, but there has to be something to make you different. When Steven wants to go traveling under an assumed name, Steven will surely take on a princely title.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:20:58] Walking route | I heard him say, \"According to his account, there is no older title than that of M. de Charlus. The Baron de Montmorency claims to be the oldest baron in France, but that's not true, for at that time they were only barons of their fiefdom, Île-de-France.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:21:03] Walking route | I saw Peter smile slightly and say. \"I heard that 'to prove to you that M. de Charlus came before the Baron de Montmorency, Steven's uncle would gladly explain it to you for hours on end. Although he is very shrewd and capable, he still finds this a very lively topic of conversation. But Steven is not like him; don't ask Steven about genealogy, for nothing is more boring or out-of-date than that to him.' Indeed, life is too short.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:21:08] Walking route | I thought of the harsh look that had made Steven turn around near the casino just now, and I realized that Steven now recognized the same fixed, unyielding gaze that he had seen when Matthew's wife called for Michael in Sunrise.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:13] On the walk | I heard, \"Tell Steven that his uncle M. de Charlus had many mistresses—was there a Matthew's wife among them?\"\n[1897-06-28 12:21:18] Walking path | I heard, \"Oh! Absolutely not! He's a close friend of Mr. Matthew, who has always given Mr. Matthew a lot of support. But no one has ever said he was Mrs. Matthew's lover. If you gave the impression that you believed that, it would cause great astonishment in high society.\"\n[1897-06-28 12:21:23] On the walk | I thought that Steven hadn't dared to answer, for if Steven had shown the slightest disbelief, people in Sunrise would have been even more astonished.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:28] On the walk | I saw Steven's grandmother captivated by M. de Charlus. I thought, of course, he placed the greatest importance on matters of lineage and social standing, and David had noticed as well.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:33] On the walk | I thought that when people are severely criticized for it, there is usually a subtle sense of envy and irritation involved, because they see another person enjoying an advantageous position that they themselves desire but cannot obtain.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:38] On the walk | I thought of David, who never bore any such reproach. On the contrary, she was perfectly satisfied with her fate, and did not at all regret that she did not live in a more distinguished social class; therefore, she simply used her own intelligence to observe the faults of M. de Charlus.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:43] On the way for a walk | When I saw her speaking about Peter's uncle, I felt a sense of detachment, a smile, almost a friendly goodwill. I thought of how Stevens repaid him with kindness, for he had given the Stevenes joy by being an object of their disinterested observation.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:48] On the walk | I thought, after all, this time the subject of observation was a person, and David found his self-importance neither reasonable nor appropriate, but at least distinctive, which made him stand out in sharp contrast to the people David usually encountered.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:53] Walking path | I thought that, in contrast to the many upper-class people Peter mocked, it was clear that M. de Charlus was extremely intelligent and highly sensitive. It was precisely because of this that Steven's grandmother easily forgave his aristocratic prejudices.\n[1897-06-28 12:21:58] Walking path | I thought that neither my uncle nor my nephew had lost this prejudice because of more outstanding qualities. More precisely, Monsieur de Charlus had reconciled the two.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:03] On the walk | I knew that, like the descendants of Baron Samuel and Prince de Lambert, he possessed archives, furniture, tapestries, and portraits of his ancestors painted by Raphael, Velázquez, and Boucher.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:23] On the walk | I thought that as long as he gave a brief account of his memories of his own family, he could truly be said to be \"visiting\" a museum and an unparalleled library.",

    "text": "[1897-06-28 12:22:28] On the way for a walk | I thought, but on the contrary, he placed all the heritage of nobility upon his nephew, who had reduced him to that position. Perhaps there was another factor as well—that he was not like Peter, not given to fantasies or empty talk, but rather a more realistic observer of human beings, and he was unwilling to ignore the element of prestige, which they considered fundamental.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:33] On the walk | I thought that although he gave his imagination an element of enjoyment free from material interests, this factor could often serve as a very effective remedy for his utilitarian activities.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:38] On the way for a walk | I thought that there has always been a debate between this kind of person and another kind. The other kind follows the call of their inner ideals, and these inner ideals urge them to give up such advantages in order to pursue their ideals single-mindedly.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:43] On the walk | I thought that in this respect, they were similar to those painters and writers who abandoned their superior skills, to craftsmen who adopted modern techniques, to warlike people who voluntarily implemented universal disarmament, to authoritarian governments that practiced democracy and abolished harsh laws, yet reality often failed to reward their noble efforts.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:48] Walking route | I thought that sometimes pacifism actually increases war, and tolerance also increases crime. If we judge only by external effects, one could say that Peter's effort to be sincere and open is truly remarkable, but it also allows people to be relieved that M. de Charlus lacks both qualities.\n[1897-06-28 12:22:53] On the way for a walk | I knew that M. de Charlus had had a large part of the beautiful woodwork from the Fairhaven mansion sent to his nephew's house, rather than, like his nephew, exchanging the furniture for a set of more modern furnishings and some paintings by Léon and Cézanne.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:13] Walk on the way | I thought Monsieur de Charlus's ideals were very artificial, which was indeed true, if the adjective \"artificial\" could be connected with the word \"ideals,\" meaning both social pretension and artistic refinement.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:18] On the walk | I thought of several women of extraordinary beauty and rare cultural refinement, whose ancestors had long ago become inseparable from all the glory and elegance of the monarchical system. He found in these women something outstanding and exceptional, which made him happy only when he was with them.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:23] On the walk | I thought that, certainly, his admiration for these women was sincere, but the many vague memories of history and art that their names evoked also played a large role.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:28] Walking route | I thought that, like a hymn by Horace, it might be inferior to some of today's poetry, yet a man of letters would find pleasure in reading the former but remain indifferent to the latter. One of the reasons he feels pleasure is the memory of antiquity.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:33] Walking route | I thought of each of these women, and compared to a beautiful bourgeois woman, they were to him like those old paintings compared to a modern oil painting depicting a road or a wedding.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:38] Walking path | I thought about those old paintings, knowing their history, beginning with the pope or king who had ordered them, then passing through various great figures, and acquired through gifts, purchases, or inheritance. They would awaken memories of some major event in Steven's mind, or at least evoke some historically significant association. Thus, the knowledge that Steven possessed gave these works a completely new purpose, enhancing the feeling of wealth that Steven felt in his mind or in his erudition.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:43] On the walk | I thought that if the kind of prejudice held by M. de Charlus prevented these ladies from associating with women of less pure lineage, and instead devoted their unchanged, noble integrity to his altar, just like the façade of an eighteenth-century building supported by smooth pink marble columns, which remained unaltered when a new dynasty came to power, he would be very pleased about it.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:48] Walking route | I thought of M. de Charlus, who praised these women for their truly lofty spirit and noble hearts, and how he played with words in an ambiguous way, deceiving himself in the process. There was also this vague concept, this false impression arising from conflating nobility, a noble heart, and art, as well as the seductive aspect of M. de Charlus himself.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:53] Walking route | I thought that for someone like Steven's grandmother, such temptation was extremely dangerous. A nobleman who only saw his own world, ignoring everything else, his prejudices were more absurd, yet also less harmful in intent.\n[1897-06-28 12:23:58] Walking route | I thought that for Steven's grandmother, such prejudices seemed extremely ridiculous, but once something appeared under the guise of superhuman wisdom, she was completely powerless against it. As a result, she believed that all princes were outstanding and admirable, because they had people like La Bruyère and Fenelon as private tutors.\n[1897-06-29 01:01:29] In front of the Grand Hotel | I saw three members of the Fairhaven family leaving the Steven group in front of the big hotel. I knew they had gone to lunch at Sophia's.\n[1897-06-29 01:01:39] In front of the big hotel | I saw that just as David was saying goodbye to Charles and Peter was saying goodbye to David, M. de Charlus, who had not spoken a word to Steven until now, took a few steps back and came up to Steven.\n[1897-06-29 01:40:47] In front of the Grand Hotel | I saw him say that and then he ran after Charles. \"I heard that Steven will have tea at Aunt Verdurin's house tonight after dinner,\" he said to Steven, \"and Steven hopes you'll do us the honor of coming with your grandmother.\"\n[1897-06-29 01:40:52] In front of the hotel | I noticed that although it was Sunday, there were not as many horse-drawn carriages in front of the hotel as there had been at the beginning of the holiday season. I thought especially of the notary's wife, who found it too expensive to hire a carriage every time she didn't go to the Sunrise house, so she just stayed in her own room.\n[1897-06-29 01:40:57] Hotel | \"I heard someone ask the notary, 'Is Madame Blandais unwell? We haven't seen her today!'\"\n[1897-06-29 01:41:02] Hotel | I heard, \"She has a headache. It's so hot, and there's a thunderstorm. A little thing like this is enough to make her... Steven wants you to see her tonight. Steven has already persuaded her to come downstairs. It would do her good.\"\n[1897-06-29 01:41:07] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that Steven believed Monsieur de Charlus had invited Steven and his companions to his aunt's house in order to make up for the rudeness he had shown Steven during their walk that morning, and Steven did not doubt that he had certainly informed his aunt.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:12] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that when Steven entered the living room in Charles, intending to greet her nephew, he kept circling around him without being able to start a conversation.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:17] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I saw him speaking in a sharp, piercing voice, telling a rather malicious story about one of their relatives. Steven couldn't catch his eye.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:22] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Steven determined to greet him, and he spoke quite loudly in order to remind him of Steven's presence. I thought, but Steven knew that he had already noticed Steven's presence.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:27] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that just as Steven was about to bow, before a single word had left his lips, Steven saw him raise two fingers to beckon Steven, but his eyes did not turn away nor did he stop speaking.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:32] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that he had obviously seen Steven, but was keeping it hidden.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:37] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that at this moment Steven realized his eyes had never been fixed on the person he was talking to, but had instead been constantly darting around. I saw eyes like those of some startled wild animal, or like those of a street vendor.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:42] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I know these street vendors, how they blow and boast about their illegal goods, yet even though their heads don't turn, they keep a watchful eye on all the points where the police might appear on the horizon.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:47] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I saw Steven notice that Charles was pleased to see Steven and his friends, but she seemed not to have expected Steven and his friends to arrive. I was a bit surprised to think of Steven.\n[1897-06-29 01:41:52] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard Monsieur de Charlus say to Steven's grandmother, \"Ah, you're here, what a fine idea. Auntie, this is really nice, isn't it?\"\n[1897-06-29 01:41:57] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that when Steven heard this, he would be even more astonished. Obviously, he noticed that his aunt had been taken aback by the sight of Steven and his companions entering. As someone accustomed to setting the tone, he probably thought that simply expressing his own pleasure would be enough to turn that surprise into joy, and indeed, Steven's visit should have inspired a feeling of happiness.\n[1897-06-29 01:42:02] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw her apparently suddenly discovering some new excellent quality in Steven's grandmother and constantly showing her attentiveness. I thought about it and realized he had calculated correctly, because Charles valued his nephew very highly, and knew how difficult it was to please him.\n[1897-06-29 01:42:07] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought about how Steven could not possibly understand that M. de Charlus had already forgotten, within a few hours, the invitation he had given Steven that morning. Although brief, the invitation had appeared so deliberately crafted, so carefully considered, and yet he had completely dismissed it as his own idea, calling it \"a good idea of Steven's grandmother.\"\n[1897-06-29 01:42:12] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that Steven was then still \"square is square, and mao is mao,\" but it was only after he grew up that he realized: you can't always find out a person's true intentions by just asking him directly; it's better to risk misunderstanding, which might pass unnoticed, than to naively stick to rigid principles, which carry far greater risks.\n[1897-06-29 01:42:17] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard 'Sir,' Steven said, with a determination to get everything clear, 'do you remember, it was you who asked Steven to come tonight, not Steven who asked you?'\"\n[1897-06-29 01:42:22] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that no movement, no sound revealed to Monsieur de Charlus that Steven had asked his question.",

    "text": "[1897-06-29 01:42:27] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I saw this situation, and Steven repeated his question again. I thought of how diplomats or those young people who had quarreled would endlessly demand clarification from the other side, but it was all in vain, for the other party had firmly resolved not to provide any.\n[1897-06-29 01:42:32] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Monsieur de Charlus not giving Steven any further reply. I thought of Steven, as if I saw a slight sneer on his lips, the sneer of someone who looks down upon others, judging their character and education.\n[1897-06-29 01:42:37] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that since he refused to offer any explanation, Steven tried to come up with one himself, but he wavered between several possibilities, none of which seemed entirely reasonable. Perhaps he had simply forgotten, or may be Steven had misunderstood what he had said to him that morning...\n[1897-06-29 01:42:42] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought it was more likely that, out of pride, he didn't want to appear as someone who had desperately tried to attract the people he looked down on, and instead preferred to make them take the initiative in coming. If that were the case, why did he still want the Stevenes to come, or rather, why did he specifically want Steven's grandmother?\n[1897-06-29 01:42:47] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that he had spoken only to Steven's grandmother all night long, and never once to Steven.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:16] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him hiding behind David and Charles, as if he were in the box himself. He was talking to them very passionately, but sometimes his all-seeing, inquisitive eyes would rest on Steven's face.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:26] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw how seriously and attentively he was taking it. I thought that Steven's face was a manuscript that was difficult to decipher.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:31] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought to myself that, without these eyes, M. de Charlus's face would be very similar to those of many handsome men.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:36] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard Peter later talking to Steven about other members of the Fairhaven family, and he said to Steven, \"Of course, Steven, Uncle Balade's entire air from head to toe, even down to his fingernails, that nobleman's attitude, that family air, they don't have it!\"\n[1897-06-29 02:39:41] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I realized that by saying this, he had definitely confirmed it: the aristocratic family manner and aristocratic traits were neither mysterious nor new, but simply composed of these elements. Steven could easily distinguish these factors and didn't feel anything particularly remarkable. Steven should have felt that one of his fantasies had been shattered.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:46] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that face, the thin layer of powder giving it a certain look of a stage face. I thought that even if Monsieur de Charlus kept his expression as tightly closed as possible, his eyes were like a crack, like a bullet hole—this was something he could not block.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:51] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought of others, viewing him from different angles, caught suddenly by the cross-reflection of some inner mechanism through this crack and this bullet hole. It seemed that this inner mechanism gave no sense of security at all, not even for someone who was not its absolute master but still carried it within himself.\n[1897-06-29 02:39:56] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I saw the expression in those eyes—cautious and constantly anxious, filled with exhaustion, and the result on the face was a large dark circle under the eyes, its lower edge very low. I thought of him himself, in a state of unstable balance, constantly on the verge of collapse.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:01] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that no matter how skillfully composed or embellished, it would make you think of a person in disguise, someone wealthy and powerful in danger, or perhaps not even a wealthy and powerful person at all, but just a dangerous and tragic figure.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:06] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought about how, when Steven saw M. de Charlus near the fairgrounds in the morning, a secret had turned Steven's gaze into a riddle, something that was absent in other men. Steven longed to decipher this secret.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:11] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought, but according to what Steven now knew of his family relationships, Steven could no longer believe that was the look of a thief; according to what Steven had heard of his conversations, Steven could no longer believe that was the look of a madman.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:16] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that his coldness toward Steven and his kindness toward Steven's grandmother probably did not come from personal likes or dislikes, but rather, in general, he had some goodwill toward women, and when talking about their flaws, he was usually very tolerant. But toward men, especially young men, he harbored great hatred, a hatred that made one think of certain men who hate women and express their hatred toward them.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:21] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that among the members of his family or among Peter's close friends were a couple of young dandies, and when Peter casually mentioned their names, M. de Charlus would say. I heard, \"These scoundrels!\"\n[1897-06-29 02:40:26] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw a fierce expression, a sharp contrast to his usual coldness. I realized that Steven had understood, and what he particularly condemned in today's youth was their excessive femininity.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:31] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him often speaking with contempt. I heard, \"This is the real deal, Grandma Robert!\"\n[1897-06-29 02:40:36] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I knew that he, after walking for several hours, would be all warm and sweaty before plunging into the cold river. I thought, but what kind of life would not seem effeminate compared to the life a man should lead, as he envisioned it? He had always considered such a life lacking in vigor and masculinity.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:41] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I knew he could not even stand a man wearing a ring. I thought that this conventional notion of masculinity did not prevent him from having very delicate and sensitive qualities.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:46] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Charles ask him to descri be the castle where Madame de Vinteuil had lived to Steven's grandmother, adding a remark at the same time. I heard that Madame de Fairhaven was so distressed at parting from the tiresome Madame de Guérin, but she herself thought it was nothing more than literary exaggeration.\n[1897-06-29 02:40:51] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard him say, 'On the contrary, Steven thought there was nothing more real than this,' he replied. 'Besides, in that era, such feelings were very understandable.'\"\n[1897-06-29 02:40:56] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard, \"The inhabitants of Monomotapa in La Fontaine's tale saw their friends in a dream, looking sad, and rushed to their houses. The greatest pain of a pigeon is when another pigeon is not by its side.\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:01] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard her say, 'Aunt, you probably think this is just as exaggerated as Madame de Sévigné's eagerness to be alone with her daughter! What wonderful words she said when she left her daughter—'This separation caused Steven inner pain, which he felt as intensely as physical pain. In parting, people are very generous with time. We move forward in the time we long for.'\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:06] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I thought of Steven's grandmother, who would be delighted to hear someone talking about these letters in exactly the same way she did herself. She was amazed that a man could understand these letters so profoundly. She felt that M. de Charlus was as noble and delicate in his emotions as a woman.",

Steven thought to himself, \"A mistress.\" This influence enabled Steven to realize how delicate a man's emotions could become through living with women!\n[1897-06-29 02:41:21] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard, 'This Madame de Sévigné, once she is with her own daughter, may well end up having nothing to say to her!'\" Charles replied.\n[1897-06-29 02:41:26] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard her say, \"There's definitely something to talk about, even if it's those trivial things she calls 'things only you and Steven would notice.' And anyway, Madame de Sévigné is often by her daughter's side.\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:31] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw M. de Charlus add, in his melancholy tone. \"I heard that La Bruyère told Steven, 'It's enough: whether you talk to the people you love or say nothing at all, it's all the same.' He was right. That is the only happiness.\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:36] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard him say, 'This happiness is a pity, because life is arranged so badly that it's hard to savor this kind of happiness. In general, Madame de Sévigné isn't any more deserving of pity than anyone else. Most of her life was spent with the people she loved.'\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:41] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard, \"You forgot, we're not talking about love, but about her daughter.\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:46] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw M. de Charlus speak on in an authoritative, unquestionable, almost peremptory tone. I heard, \"But what is important in life is not the person that Steven loves, but Steven himself in love.\"\n[1897-06-29 02:41:51] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard that the feelings of Madame de Sévigné for her daughter were less like the vulgar relationship between the young Marquis de Sévigné and his mistresses, and more like the passion depicted by Racine in Andromaque or Phèdre. Similarly, loving God because of love for this mysticism.\n[1897-06-29 02:41:56] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard someone say, \"The boundaries that Stevens draw around love are too narrow, and the only reason is that Stevens are too ignorant of life.\"\n[1897-06-29 02:42:01] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I saw Peter ask his uncle, his tone slightly contemptuous. I heard, \"Do you like 'Andromaque' and 'Phèdre' very much?\"\n[1897-06-29 02:42:06] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard that the truth contained in a tragedy by Racine is greater than all of Monsieur Unknown_Victor Hugo's comedies,\" De Charlus replied.\n[1897-06-29 02:42:11] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Peter lean over and whisper to Steven. I heard, \"This upper class, whatever the case may be, is really terrifying! To prefer Racine to Hugo, whatever the case may be, is simply too much!\"\n[1897-06-29 02:42:16] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I thought about what his uncle had said, and it truly troubled him, but by uttering \"in any case\" and \"excessive,\" he found a kind of pleasure, which was a comfort to him.\n[1897-06-29 17:41:57] Hotel | I saw Peter talking to Steven while waiting for his uncle. I knew the result would be in vain.\n[1897-06-29 17:57:50] In front of the amusement park | I saw him the next morning when Steven returned to the hotel, passing alone in front of the amusement park. I thought that Steven felt someone watching him not far away from Steven.\n[1897-06-29 17:57:55] In front of the amusement park | I saw Steven turn his head away. I saw Steven see a man in his forties, tall and quite fat, with a thick black mustache.\n[1897-06-29 17:58:05] In front of the amusement park | I saw him, his eyes wide and fixed intently on Steven, nervously tapping his trousers with a small cane.\n[1897-06-29 17:58:15] In front of the amusement park | I saw Steven, whose eyes, extremely flexible, would roll about in their sockets. I thought that a person would have such an expression only when standing before a stranger, a stranger who, for some reason, would make you think of things that others—like a madman or a spy—would not.\n[1897-06-29 17:58:20] In front of the amusement park | I saw him send Steven an exquisite glance, bold yet cautious, swift yet profound, like a final look cast in flight.\n[1897-06-29 17:58:30] In front of the amusement park | I saw him glance around, then suddenly adopt an air of indifference and arrogance, and in a flash, he turned his body to look at a poster.\n[1897-06-29 17:58:40] In front of the amusement park | I saw him intently looking at the poster, humming a tune, and adjusting the moss rose that hung in his buttonhole.\n[1897-06-29 17:58:50] In front of the amusement park | I saw him take out a note book from his pocket, as if he were writing down the title of the play.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:00] In front of the amusement park | I saw him take out his watch two or three times, pulling down the brim of a flat black hat over his eyes, then putting his hand over it to lengthen the brim of the hat, as if to see if anyone was coming.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:10] In front of the amusement park | I saw him make an unsatisfied gesture. I thought that through this action, one could tell he had grown impatient.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:15] In front of the amusement park | I thought that if one were really waiting for someone, one would never make such a gesture.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:20] In front of the amusement park | I saw him then push his hat back from his forehead. I saw a brush-cut head, but both sides still had long, curved pigeon wings.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:30] In Front of the Amusement Park | I saw him let out a loud breath. I thought that when people not only feel very hot but also want to show they can't stand the heat, they breathe like that.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:35] In front of the amusement park | I thought of Steven, and suddenly realized that this was a hotel swindler. He might have noticed Steven and Steven's grandmother a few days ago and was preparing to take advantage of them, but he had just discovered, when he was eyeing Steven, that he had been caught by Steven.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:40] In Front of the Amusement Park | I thought that in order to deceive Steven, he might try to adopt this new posture, making a great effort to appear indifferent and uninterested.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:45] In front of the amusement park | I thought that he was being far too exaggerated, so much so that it seemed his purpose was not only to dispel any suspicion Steven might have had, to take revenge on Steven for any insults he may have unwittingly offered him, but also to make Steven understand that he hadn't even seen Steven, and that Steven was such an unimportant person that he couldn't possibly have attracted his attention.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:50] In front of the amusement park | I saw him adopt the posture of a brave man, standing straight, puckering his lips, lifting his mustache, and in his eyes adding something utterly indifferent, harsh, and almost insulting. I thought of the result, which was his strange expression, making Steven sometimes see him as a thief and sometimes as a madman.\n[1897-06-29 17:59:55] In front of the amusement park | I saw, but Steven noticed his dress was extremely refined, far more serious and simple than the attire of any of the sea-bathers he had seen in Riverside. I felt relieved that the suit called Steven was safe, because the bright, glaring, and tasteless colors of those people's seaside clothes often insulted Steven's suit.",

    "text": "[1897-06-29 22:43:41] Near the hotel | I saw that just then Steven's grandmother came to meet Steven, and they walked around together.\n[1897-06-29 22:59:34] In front of the hotel door | I saw that an hour later, she went back to the hotel for a little while, and Steven was waiting for her in front of the hotel.\n[1897-06-29 22:59:44] In front of the hotel | I saw then that Steven saw Charles and Peter, along with the stranger who had stared so intently at Steven in front of the casino, walking out together.\n[1897-06-29 22:59:54] In front of the hotel | I saw his gaze, just like when Steven had first seen him, flashing quickly across Steven's body. I thought, then, as if he hadn't seen Steven at all, he withdrew his gaze back to a spot just below his eyes, dull and neutral, pretending not to see anything on the surface, and not seeing anything inside.\n[1897-06-29 22:59:59] In front of the hotel | I thought of that look as merely the act of widening one's eyes, spreading one's eyelashes, and feeling satisfied with the presence of those lashes around them. It was the pious and intoxicated gaze of certain hypocrites, the self-important look of certain fools.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:04] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven seeing that he had changed his clothes. Now he was wearing a darker jacket. I thought that this was obviously because true elegance is somewhat closer to simplicity than false elegance.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:09] In front of the hotel | I thought, but there was something else: closer to people, one feels that the reason these clothes have almost no other colors is not because the person who eliminated the colors is indifferent to them, but rather, more accurately, because for some reason, he has forbidden himself from using color.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:14] In front of the hotel | I thought that the simplicity of these clothes seemed to come from obedience to some sort of rule, rather than from a lack of interest in color.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:19] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven noticing the dark green silk in the fabric of his trousers, which harmonized perfectly with the stripes on his socks. I thought of the powerful influence of that aesthetic view which revealed such refinement through a uniform preference for dark colors, and to this taste, out of a spirit of tolerance, I had only made this single concession.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:24] In front of the hotel door | I saw a red spot on the necktie. I thought that being audacious was difficult to detect.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:29] In front of the hotel | \"I heard, 'How are you? Steven is here to introduce you to Baron de Fairhaven, Steven's nephew.' Charles said to Steven.\"\n[1897-06-29 23:00:34] In front of the hotel | I saw the stranger, who wasn't looking at Steven, mutter something vague like \"the honor,\" followed immediately by \"Oh, oh, oh.\" I thought of giving his kindness a somewhat forced meaning.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:39] In front of the hotel | I saw him curl his little finger, thumb, and index finger, and extend his middle and ring fingers toward Steven, neither of which had a ring on them.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:49] In front of the hotel | I saw Steven holding the two fingers through his Swedish gloves. Then he didn't raise his eyes to Steven, but turned his back toward Charles.\n[1897-06-29 23:00:59] In front of the hotel | \"I heard 'Oh, Steven has gone out of his mind?' the lady said with a smile, 'Steven called you Baron de Fairhaven! Steven introduced you to this gentleman, Baron de Charlus. Anyway, this mistake isn't too serious,' she added, 'after all, you really do have the name Fairhaven!\"\n[1897-06-29 23:01:04] In front of the hotel | At that moment, Steven's grandmother came out, and Steven and his companions set off together.\n[1897-06-30 02:57:46] On the way for a walk | I saw Peter's uncle not only refused to say a single word to Steven, but even didn't glance at Steven.\n[1897-06-30 02:57:56] Walking path | I saw that although he scrutinized strangers—on this brief walk, he cast a couple of menacing and penetrating glances at some utterly insignificant and most humble passersby as a test—he never looked at people he knew. I thought that if Steven's judgment was to be trusted--like a police detective who, in carrying out a secret mission, places his friend outside the scope of his professional surveillance.\n[1897-06-30 02:58:01] On the way for a walk | I saw Steven let his David, Charles, and others talk to him, keeping Peter in the background. I heard \"Tell Steven, did Steven not hear clearly? Charles told your uncle that he used to be a member of the Fairhaven family.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:58:06] On the way for a walk | I heard, \"Yes, of course, he's Unknown_Balzac de Fairhaven.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:58:11] On the walk | I heard, \"There's a castle near Sunrise, whose owner claims to be a descendant of Geneviève de Brabant. Is he related to the family named Gerguillot?\"\n[1897-06-30 02:58:16] On the way for a walk | \"I heard him say, 'Absolutely right: Uncle Steven, no one is more knowledgeable about heraldry than he is. He would tell you that the 'cry' and 'battle cry' of the Stevenes were first 'Sunrise men,' and later became 'King of Passy.' \" He smiled. \"The current owner of this castle is his brother.\" I thought of not wanting to appear proud of this \"shout\" privilege, which only the almost royal families and head of large factions could have.\n[1897-06-30 02:58:21] On the way for a walk | I knew that Charles was thus closely related to the Fairhaven family.\n[1897-06-30 02:58:41] On the walk | I know, but for Steven, she had remained for a long time the lady who, when he was a child, had given him a box of chocolates with a duck holding them, and at that time, she was more remote from the Fairhaven side than from the Méséglise side. I thought that, in Steven's eyes, I was not as distinguished or socially prominent as the optician in Sunrise.\n[1897-06-30 02:58:46] Walk on the way | I thought that now, suddenly, her value had doubled, and in parallel, other items owned by Steven had unexpectedly lost value. Whether it was appreciation or depreciation, they all brought about numerous changes, just like the transformations in Ovid, within Steven's childhood and the various remnants of that childhood.\n[1897-06-30 02:58:51] On the walk | I heard, \"Is there a full set of busts of the ancient officials of the Fairhaven family in this castle?\"\n[1897-06-30 02:58:56] Walking route | I saw Peter speaking sarcastically. I heard, \"Yes, it's a fine view. Let's talk, don't tell anyone: Steven finds all this utterly dull.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:01] On the walk | \"I heard him say, 'But there's more interesting things at Fairhaven! That's the portrait of Steven's aunt by Gérard, it's very moving. As beautiful as Whistler's or Velázquez's works,' Peter added. I thought of him, caught up in his Protestant fervor, and how he could not always accurately grasp the great measure.\n[1897-06-30 02:59:06] On the way for a walk | \"I heard that there's also a moving painting by Gustave Moreau. Steven's aunt is your friend, the niece of Charles, who was raised by this lady, and she married her cousin, who is also the nephew of Madame de Charles, the current Baron Samuel.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:11] On the way for a walk | I heard, \"So what is your uncle's profession?\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:16] Walk on the way | \"I heard that his noble title was Monsieur de Charlus. According to custom, when Steven's maternal grandfather died, Steven's uncle Barbe-Durand should have inherited the title of Prince de Lom, which his older brother had held before becoming Samuel of Fairhaven. In this family, changing names and surnames was as common as changing underclothes.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:21] On the walk | I heard him say, \"But Steven's uncle has some very particular ideas about all these things. He thinks titles like Samuel from Italy, or those high-ranking Spanish titles, are used too often. Although he could choose among a half-dozen princely titles, he kept the title of M. de Charlus as a form of protest, which on the surface seems very modest, but in reality contains a great deal of pride.\"",

    "text": "[1897-06-30 02:59:26] Walking route | I heard him say, \"Nowadays everyone is a prince, but you have to have something to make you different. When Steven wants to go traveling under an assumed name, Steven will surely take on a princely title.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:31] Walk on the way | \"I heard him say, 'According to his account, there is no older title than that of M. de Charlus. The Baron de Montrouge claims to be the oldest baron in France, but that's not true, for at that time they were only barons of their fiefdom, the Ile de France.'\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:36] Walk along the way | I saw Peter smile slightly and say. \"I heard that 'in order to prove to you that M. de Charlus came before the Baron de Montmorency, Steven's uncle would happily explain it to you for several hours. Although he is very shrewd and talented, he still thinks it's a very lively topic of conversation. But Steven isn't like him—don't ask Steven about genealogy, because nothing bores him more, nothing is more outdated than that.' Indeed, life is too short.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:41] On the way for a walk | I thought of the harsh look that had made Steven turn around near the casino just now, and realized that Steven must now recognize the same fixed, unyielding gaze that he had seen when Matthew's wife called for Michael in Sunrise.\n[1897-06-30 02:59:46] Walking route | I heard, \"Tell Steven that his uncle M. de Charlus has had many mistresses—does that include Matthew's wife?\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:51] On the way for a walk | \"I heard, 'Oh! Absolutely not! He's a close friend of Mr. Matthew, who has always given Mr. Matthew a lot of support. But no one has ever said he was Matthew's wife's lover. If you gave the impression that you believed that, it would certainly cause great astonishment in high society.\"\n[1897-06-30 02:59:56] On the walk | I thought that Steven didn't dare to answer, because if Steven had shown he didn't believe it, people in Sunrise would have been even more astonished.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:01] On the walk | I saw Steven's grandmother captivated by Monsieur de Charlus. I thought, of course, he was extremely concerned with matters of lineage and social status, and David had noticed as well.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:06] Walking route | I thought that when people are severely criticized for it, there is usually a subtle sense of envy and irritation involved, because they see another person enjoying an advantageous position that they themselves desire but cannot possess.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:11] Walk along the way | I thought of David, who never showed any such severity. On the contrary, she was perfectly satisfied with her fate and felt no regret at not living in a more distinguished social class. Therefore, she simply used her own intelligence to observe the flaws of M. de Charlus.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:16] Walking route | When I saw her speaking about Peter's uncle with a resigned, smiling, almost friendly kindness. I thought of how the Stevenes repaid him with kindness, for he had brought them pleasure by being an object of disinterested observation.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:21] Walking route | I thought, after all, this time the subject of observation was a person, and David found his self-importance not entirely reasonable, but at least distinctive, which made him stand out in contrast to the people David usually met.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:26] On the walk | I thought, in contrast to the many upper-class people Peter mocked, it was clear that M. de Charlus was extremely intelligent and highly sensitive. It was precisely because of this that Steven's David easily forgave his aristocratic prejudices.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:31] On the walk | I thought that neither the uncle nor the nephew had lost this prejudice because of more outstanding qualities. More precisely, Monsieur de Charlus had reconciled the two.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:36] Walk on the way | I knew that, like the descendants of Baron Samuel and Prince de Lambert, he possessed archives, furniture, tapestries, and portraits of his ancestors painted by Raphael, Velázquez, and Boucher.\n[1897-06-30 03:00:56] On the walk | I thought that as long as I summarized his memories of his own family, I could truly say that he was \"visiting\" a museum and an unparalleled library.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:01] Walking path | I thought, but on the contrary, he placed all the heritage of the nobility upon his nephew, who had relegated him to that position. Perhaps there was another factor as well—that he was not like Peter, not given to fantasies or empty talk, but rather a more realistic observer of human beings, and he was unwilling to ignore the factor of authority, which they considered fundamental.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:06] Walking path | I thought that although he gave his imagination an element of enjoyment free from material interests, this factor could often serve as a very effective remedy for his utilitarian activities.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:11] Walking route | I thought that there has always been a debate between this kind of person and another kind. The other kind follows the call of inner ideals, and these inner ideals urge them to give up such advantages in order to focus solely on realizing their ideals.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:16] On the walkway | I thought that in this respect, they were similar to painters and writers who had given up their superior techniques, to craftsmen who used modern methods, to warlike people who had voluntarily disarmed, to authoritarian governments that had adopted democracy and abolished harsh laws, yet reality often failed to reward their noble efforts.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:21] On the walk | I thought that sometimes pacifism actually increases war, and tolerance also increases crime. If we judge only by external effects, one could say that Peter's effort to be sincere and open is truly remarkable, but it also allows people to be relieved that M. de Charlus lacks exactly these two qualities.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:26] On the walk | I knew that M. Sully-Prudhomme had had a large part of the beautiful woodwork from the Fairhaven mansion transported to his nephew's house, rather than, like his nephew, exchanging the furniture for a set of fashionable furnishings and some paintings by Lévy and Gérôme.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:46] Walking route | I thought Monsieur de Charlus's ideals were very artificial, which is true, if the adjective \"artificial\" can be associated with the word \"ideals,\" meaning something both social and artistic.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:51] On the walk | I thought of several women of extraordinary beauty and rare cultural refinement, whose ancestors had long ago become inseparably entwined with all the glory and elegance of the monarchical system. From these women, he found something outstanding and exceptional, which made him happy only when he was with them.\n[1897-06-30 03:01:56] Walk on the way | I thought that, indeed, his admiration for these women was sincere, but the many vague memories of history and art evoked by their names also played a large role.\n[1897-06-30 03:02:01] On the walk | I thought that, like a hymn by Horace, it might be inferior to some of today's poetry, yet a man of letters would find pleasure in reading the former but remain indifferent to the latter. One of the reasons he feels pleasure is the memory of antiquity.\n[1897-06-30 03:02:06] Walking route | I thought of each of these women, and compared to a beautiful bourgeois woman, they were to him like those old paintings compared to a modern oil painting depicting a road or a wedding.\n[1897-06-30 03:02:11] On the walk | I thought about those old paintings, knowing their history, beginning with the pope or king who had commissioned them, then passing through various important figures. Through gifts, purchases, acquisitions, or inheritances, these paintings would awaken in Stevenes' memories a recollection of some significant event, at the very least evoking a historically meaningful association. Thus, the knowledge that Stevenes possessed gave these works a completely new purpose, enhancing their sense of wealth within Stevenes' mind or in their learned collections.\n[1897-06-30 03:02:16] On the way for a walk | I thought that if the kind of prejudice that Monsieur de Charlus had were to prevent these ladies from associating with women of less pure lineage, and to have them offer their unchanged, noble integrity to his altar, just like the façade of an eighteenth-century building supported by smooth pink marble columns, which a new dynasty arrived but did not alter in the least, he would be very pleased about it.\n[1897-06-30 03:02:21] On the walk | I thought of M. de Charlus, who praised these women for their genuine spiritual nobility and high moral character, playing with words in an ambiguous way that deceived himself. There was also this vague concept, this false impression arising from the confusion between nobility, moral integrity, and art, as well as the seductive aspect of Charlus himself.",

    "text": "[1897-06-30 03:02:26] On the way for a walk | I thought about how such temptation was very dangerous for people like Steven's grandmother. A nobleman, who only saw his own interests and ignored everything else, his prejudices were more absurd but also less harmful in intent.\n[1897-06-30 03:02:31] On the way for a walk | I thought that for Steven's grandmother, such prejudices seemed extremely ridiculous, but once something appeared under the guise of superhuman wisdom, she was completely powerless against it. As a result, she believed that all princes were outstanding and admirable, because they had people like La Bruyère and Fenelon as private tutors.\n[1897-06-30 15:40:02] In front of the big hotel | I saw three members of the Fairhaven family leaving the Steven group in front of the big hotel. I knew they had gone to lunch at Sophia's.\n[1897-06-30 15:40:12] In front of the big hotel | I saw that just as David was saying goodbye to Charles and Peter was saying goodbye to David, Monsieur de Charlus, who had not spoken a word to Steven until now, took a few steps back and came over to Steven's side.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:04] In front of the big hotel | I saw him say that and then he ran after Charles. I heard him say, \"Tonight after dinner, Steven is having tea at Aunt Valbrielle's house,\" and he added to Steven, \"Steven would be pleased if you could come with your David.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:16:09] In front of the hotel | I noticed that although it was Sunday, there were not as many horse carriages in front of the hotel as there had been at the beginning of the holiday season. I thought especially of the notary's wife, who felt it was too expensive to hire a carriage every time she didn't go to the Sunrise house, so she just stayed in her own room.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:14] Hotel | \"I heard someone ask the notary, 'Is Madame Blandais unwell? We haven't seen her today!'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:16:19] Hotel | \"I heard that she has a headache, it's so hot, and there's a thunderstorm. She always makes a big deal out of the smallest things. Steven wants you to see her tonight. Steven has already persuaded her to come downstairs. It would do her good.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:16:24] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that Steven believed Monsieur de Charlus had invited Steven and his companions to his aunt's house in order to make up for the rudeness he had shown Steven during their walk that morning, and Steven did not doubt that he had certainly informed his aunt.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:29] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw it, but when Steven entered the living room in Charles and tried to greet her nephew, Steven kept circling around him without managing to strike up a conversation.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:34] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him speaking in a sharp, thin voice, telling a rather malicious story about one of their relatives. Steven couldn't catch his eye.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:39] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Steven determined to greet him, and he spoke quite loudly in order to remind him of Steven's presence. I thought, but Steven knew that he had already noticed Steven's existence.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:44] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that just as Steven was about to bow, before a single word had left Steven's lips, Steven saw him extend two fingers for Steven to shake, but his eyes didn't turn away or stop talking.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:49] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I thought that he had obviously seen Steven, but was keeping it hidden.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:54] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I saw that at this moment Steven realized his eyes never fixed on the person he was talking to, but instead kept darting around constantly. I saw eyes like those of certain startled wild animals, or like those of street vendors.\n[1897-06-30 17:16:59] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I know these street vendors, how they blow and boast about their illegal goods, yet even though their heads don't turn, they keep a sharp eye out for the police appearing at any point on the horizon.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:04] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that Steven noticed, and Charles was pleased to see the Stevenes coming, but she seemed not to have expected the Stevenes to arrive. I was a bit surprised by Steven.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:09] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard Monsieur de Charlus say to Steven's grandmother, \"Ah, you've arrived, what a fine idea. Auntie, this is really nice, isn't it?\"\n[1897-06-30 17:17:14] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that when Steven heard this, he would be even more astonished. Obviously, he noticed that his aunt had been taken aback by the sight of Steven and his companions entering. As someone accustomed to setting the tone, he probably thought that by merely expressing his own pleasure, he could transform that surprise into joy, and indeed, Steven's visit should have aroused a feeling of happiness.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:19] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw her apparently suddenly discovering some new excellent quality in Steven's grandmother and constantly showing her attentiveness. I thought he had calculated correctly, because Charles valued his nephew very highly, and knew how difficult it was to please him.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:24] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I thought about how Steven could not possibly understand that Monsieur de Charlus had already completely forgotten the invitation he had given Steven that very morning within a few hours. Although the invitation was brief, it had appeared so deliberately crafted, so carefully considered, and yet he had actually taken it as his own idea, calling it \"a good idea\" from Steven's grandmother.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:29] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that Steven was then still \"square is square, and mao is mao,\" but it was only after he grew up that he realized: you can't always find out a person's true intentions by just asking him directly; it's better to risk misunderstanding, since misunderstandings sometimes pass unnoticed, and this risk is far less than the danger of naively sticking to rigid principles.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:34] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard 'Sir,' Steven said to him, with the determination to get everything clear, 'you remember, wasn't it you who asked Steven to come tonight?\"\n[1897-06-30 17:17:39] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that no movement, no sound betrayed that Monsieur de Charlus had heard Steven's question.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:44] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw this situation, and Steven repeated his question again. I thought of diplomats or those young people who, in a state of quarrel, endlessly demand clarification from the other side, but it's all in vain, for the other party has made up their mind not to provide any.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:49] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Monsieur de Charlus not giving Steven any further reply. I thought of Steven, as if I could see a slight sneer on his lips, the kind of sneer that comes from someone looking down upon others' characters and education.\n[1897-06-30 17:17:54] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I thought that since he refused to offer any explanation, Steven tried to come up with one himself, but he wavered between several possibilities, none of which could be considered entirely reasonable. Perhaps he had simply forgotten, or may be Steven had misunderstood what he had said to him that morning...\n[1897-06-30 17:17:59] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought it was more likely that, out of pride, he didn't want to appear as someone who had desperately tried to attract the people he looked down on, and instead preferred to make them take the initiative themselves. If that were the case, why then did he so desperately want the Marceaux to come, or more accurately, why did he so desperately want Steven's grandmother to come?\n[1897-06-30 17:18:04] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that he had spoken only to Steven's grandmother all evening, and never once to Steven.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:09] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him hiding behind David and Charles, as if he were in the box himself. He was talking to them very passionately, but sometimes his all-seeing eyes, his inquisitive gaze, would rest on Steven's face.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:14] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw his solemn and earnest expression. I thought that Steven's face was a difficult-to-decipher manuscript.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:19] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that, obviously, without these eyes, M. de Charlus's face would be very similar to those of many handsome men.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:24] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I later heard Peter talking to Steven about other members of the Fairhaven family, and he said to Steven, \"Of course, Uncle Balat-Madame's whole manner from head to toe, right down to the tips of her fingernails, that air of nobility, that family style—they don't have it at all!\"\n[1897-06-30 17:18:29] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that by saying this, he had definitely confirmed it: the aristocratic family manner and aristocratic traits were neither mysterious nor new, but simply made up of these elements. Steven could easily distinguish these factors and felt no particular emotion about them; Steven should have felt that one of his fantasies had been shattered.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:34] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that face, the thin layer of powder giving it a certain look of a stage face. I thought that even if Monsieur de Charlus sealed his expression as tightly as possible, it was no use. His eyes were like a crack, like a bullet hole—this was the one place he couldn't block off.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:39] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought of others, viewing him from different angles, caught suddenly by the cross-reflection of some inner mechanism through this crack and this bullet hole. It seemed this inner mechanism was utterly unreliable, even for someone who was not its absolute master but still carried it within himself.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:44] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw the expression in those eyes, cautious and constantly anxious, filled with exhaustion; the result on the face was a large dark circle under the eyes, with a very low lower edge. I thought of him himself being in a state of unstable balance, constantly on the verge of collapse.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:49] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that no matter how skillfully composed or embellished, it would make you think of a person in disguise, someone wealthy and powerful in danger, or perhaps not even someone wealthy and powerful at all, but just a dangerous and tragic figure.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:54] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought about how, when Steven saw M. de Charlus near the amusement park in the morning, a secret had turned his gaze into a riddle for Steven, a secret that no other man possessed. Steven longed to decipher this mystery.\n[1897-06-30 17:18:59] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought, but according to what Steven now knew of his family relationships, Steven could no longer believe that was the look of a thief; according to what Steven had heard of his conversations, Steven could no longer believe that was the look of a madman.\n[1897-06-30 17:19:04] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought that his coldness toward Steven and his kindness toward Steven's grandmother probably did not come from personal likes or dislikes, but rather, in general, he had some goodwill toward women, and when talking about their flaws, he was usually very tolerant; whereas toward men, especially young men, he harbored great hatred, a hatred that made one think of certain men's hatred for women.\n[1897-06-30 17:19:09] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that among his family or among Peter's close friends were a couple of young dandies, and when Peter casually mentioned their names, M. de Charlus would say. I heard, \"These scoundrels!\"\n[1897-06-30 17:19:14] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw a fierce expression, a sharp contrast to his usual coldness. I realized that Steven understood perfectly, and what he especially condemned about today's youth was that they were too feminine.",

I heard, \"This is the real deal, David Robert!\"\n[1897-06-30 17:19:24] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I knew that he, after walking for several hours, would suddenly plunge into the cold river, his body still warm from the exertion. I thought, but what kind of life would not seem effeminate compared to the life a man should lead, as he envisioned it? He had always considered such a life lacking in vigor and masculinity.\n[1897-06-30 17:19:29] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I knew he couldn't even stand a man wearing a ring. I thought that this conventional notion of masculinity did not prevent him from having very delicate and sensitive qualities.\n[1897-06-30 17:19:34] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Charles ask him to descri be to Steven's grandmother the castle where Madame de Véry had lived, along with a note. I heard that Madame de Guérin, the tiresome one, made Madame de Sévigné so sad to part with her, but she herself thought it was nothing more than literary exaggeration.\n[1897-06-30 17:19:39] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | \"I heard him say, 'On the contrary, Steven felt that nothing was more real than this,' he replied. 'Besides, in those days, people could really understand such feelings.'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:19:44] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard, \"The inhabitants of Monomotapa in La Fontaine's tale dream of their friends looking sad, and so they rush to their homes. The greatest pain of a dove is when another dove is not by its side.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:19:49] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard her say, 'Aunt, you probably think this is just as exaggerated as Madame de Sévigné's eagerness to be alone with her daughter! What wonderful words she said when she left her daughter—'This separation pains Steven deeply, Steven feels it as bodily pain. In parting, people are generous with time. We move forward in the time we long for.'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:19:54] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought how delighted my grandmother would be to hear someone speaking about these letters in exactly the same way she did herself. She was amazed that a man could understand these letters so profoundly. She felt that M. de Charlus was truly as noble and delicate in his emotions as a woman.\n[1897-06-30 17:19:59] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw later that when the Stevenes were alone together talking about him, they said he must have been deeply influenced by a woman, either his Robert or, later on, his daughter, if he had any children.\n[1897-06-30 17:20:04] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought of Steven thinking about Peter's mistress, and in Steven's eyes, she had a great influence on him. Steven thought to himself, \"A mistress.\" This influence enabled Steven to realize how delicate a man's emotions could become when he lived with women!\n[1897-06-30 17:20:09] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard that 'this Lady de Sévigné, once she's with her daughter, may very well have nothing to say to her!' \" Charles replied.\n[1897-06-30 17:20:14] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard her say, \"There's definitely something to talk about, even if it's those trivial things she calls 'things only you and Steven would notice.' And anyway, Madame de Sévigné is often by her daughter's side.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:20:19] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw M. de Charlus add, in a melancholy tone. I heard that La Bruyère told Steven, \"That's enough: it's all the same whether you talk to the people you love or say nothing at all.\" He was right, that's the only happiness.\n[1897-06-30 17:20:24] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard him say, 'This happiness is a pity, for life is arranged so poorly that it's hard to savor such happiness. In general, Madame de Sévigné was no more deserving of pity than anyone else. Most of her life was spent with the people she loved.'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:20:29] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I heard, \"You forgot, we're not talking about love, but about her daughter.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:20:34] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw M. de Charlus speak on with an authoritative, unchallengeable, almost decisive tone. I heard, \"But what is important in life is not the people that Stevenes love, but the Stevenes who are in love.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:20:39] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard that the feelings of Madame de Sévigné for her daughter were less like the vulgar relations between young Monsieur de Sévigné and his mistresses, and more like the passion described by Racine in Andromaque or Phèdre. Similarly, loving God because of love for this mysticism.\n[1897-06-30 17:20:44] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard someone say, \"The boundaries that Steven and his kind draw around love are too narrow, and the only reason is that Stevenes are too ignorant of life.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:20:49] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Peter ask his uncle, his tone slightly contemptuous. \"I heard, 'Do you like Andromaque and Hypermnestra very much?'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:20:54] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard that the truth contained in a tragedy by Racine is greater than all of Monsieur Unknown_Victor Hugo's comedies,\" De Charlus replied.\n[1897-06-30 17:20:59] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Peter lean over and whisper to Steven. I heard, \"This upper class, whatever the case may be, is really terrifying! To prefer Racine to Hugo, whatever the case may be, is simply too much!\"\n[1897-06-30 17:21:04] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I thought about what his uncle had said, and it truly troubled him. Yet, by uttering \"whatever the case may be\" and \"excessive,\" he found a sense of pleasure, which was a comfort to him.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:09] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I knew that M. de Charlus's sentimental remarks about parting and sorrow made Steven's grandmother later tell Steven that the nephew from Charles understood certain works far better than his aunt. I thought that something in this nephew's mind made him far superior to most of the people in the nobleman's club.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:14] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | From these impressions, he not only revealed a delicate sensitivity, but his voice was also different—similar to certain contraltos whose middle register had not been sufficiently trained, so that when he sang, it seemed like a duet between a young man and a woman.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:19] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that when he expressed these delicate thoughts, his voice rested on high notes, revealing an unexpected tenderness, as if it contained the harmonious chorus of his fiancée and sisters, expressing their tenderness. I thought that if, in his voice, there seemed to be a group of young girls sheltered within it, M. de Charlus would probably feel very upset.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:24] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that when he was talking, people often heard their sharp and cheerful laughter. I saw these boarding school girls or flirtatious young women attacking the men beside them with witty and humorous words, pouting their lips.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:29] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I heard that \"Israël is the surname of these people, but Steven always felt it was a term for classification, a racial category, rather than a proper name.\" I know he said there was a house that had once belonged to his family, where Marie-Antoinette had lived, and the garden had been designed by Le Nôtre. Now the house belonged to the wealthy Israël family, who had bought it.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:34] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him shouting. I heard, \"I don't know why, but may be people like them don't have surnames, and are only referred to by the collective they belong to. That's fine! But it was once the Fairhaven' house, and now it belongs to the Israel family!!!\"\n[1897-06-30 17:21:39] Madame Verdurin's drawing room | I heard someone say, \"It makes you think of a room in the Château de Blois. The tour guide who shows people around the castle arrives there and says to Steven, 'Mary Stuart used to pray here, and now Steven is putting brooms and such things here.'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:21:44] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard that 'naturally, Steven doesn't want to know anything about this disgraceful house and Clara de Simeon, Steven's aunt who ran away from her husband. But Steven still keeps the photos of the house when it was still intact, and also the photo of the princess, whose big eyes still only saw Steven's cousin then.'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:21:49] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him say to Steven's grandmother. I heard him say, \"When a photograph is no longer a copy of a real object, but shows things that no longer exist, it gains a certain authority. Since you're interested in such architecture, Steven can give you one.\"\n[1897-06-30 17:21:54] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw that at this moment, he realized the bright floral edging of his embroidered handkerchief had slipped out of his pocket. He quickly put the handkerchief back into his pocket. I thought of the expression of terror as resembling that of a woman who was overly shy but by no means innocent, concealing certain of her charms, and because she was too concerned with propriety, she felt it indecent to reveal them.\n[1897-06-30 17:21:59] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard him continue, 'You can imagine, these people first of all destroyed Renoult's garden, which was just as criminal as tearing up a Poussin painting! For that alone, these Israel family members should be put in prison.'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:22:04] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw him pause for a moment, then he added with a smile. \"I heard him say, 'Of course there are many things they should be in prison for, that's true! Anyway, just imagine what effect a British-style garden in front of these buildings would have!'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:22:09] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard Charles say, 'But the house is of the same style as the Petit Trianon,' 'Marie Antoinette also had an English garden built at the Petit Trianon, wasn't there!'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:22:14] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard 'That English garden always spoils the beauty of Gabriel's façade!' De Charlus replied, 'Clearly, now to tear down that rustic cottage would be almost a barbaric crime!'\"\n[1897-06-30 17:22:19] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | \"I heard, 'But no matter what the modern spirit is, a whimsical idea of Mrs. Israël could never carry the same weight as the memory of the queen, and Steven always remained doubtful about it.'\"\n[1897-07-01 04:42:47] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | During this time, David had already signaled to Steven to go upstairs to bed, although Peter kept insisting he stay. I thought of Peter's hint to M. de Charlus that Steven often felt sad before going to bed at night, and his uncle must have found this rather unmanly, which would have surely embarrassed Steven!\n[1897-07-01 04:42:57] The drawing room of Madame Verdurin | I saw Steven linger a while longer, and then he left.",

    "text": "[1897-07-01 12:50:28] Marcel's Room | I saw that after a while, Steven heard someone knocking at the door. Steven asked who it was. What surprised Steven was that the voice he heard was that of M. de Charlus.\n[1897-07-01 12:50:33] Marcel's Room | I saw him say it dryly. \"I heard, 'It's Charlus. Sir, may Steven come in?'\"\n[1897-07-01 12:50:38] Marcel's Room | I saw him come in, and even after closing the door, he continued speaking in the same dry manner. I heard, \"Steven's nephew just said that you were feeling a bit restless before going to sleep, and also that you greatly admire Christopher's works. Steven has a book by Christopher in his trunk, which you may not have read, and so he's bringing it over to help you pass the time during this unpleasant period.\"\n[1897-07-01 12:50:43] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven very excitedly thanking Monsieur de Charlus. I thought to myself and said to him that, on the contrary, Steven was afraid that Peter would say that Steven felt unwell when night came, making Steven appear more foolish and ridiculous in Peter's eyes than he actually was.\n[1897-07-01 12:50:48] Marcel's Room | I saw him answer, his tone somewhat gentler. \"I heard, 'It's not true. You probably have no personal talents, Steven knows nothing about it. But talented people are so rare! Still, for a time at least, you have youth, which is always an extremely tempting thing.\"\n[1897-07-01 12:50:53] Marcel's Room | \"I heard him say, 'Besides, the greatest folly is to think that any emotion you yourself haven't felt is either ridiculous or deserving of condemnation. Steven likes the night, yet you tell Steven that you're afraid of the night. Steven likes the fragrance of roses, yet Steven has a friend whose body temperature rises at the scent of roses. Do you really think Steven therefore considers him less than Steven?\"\n[1897-07-01 12:50:58] Marcel's Room | \"I heard 'Steven tries to understand everything, Steven avoids blaming anything. In short, don't complain too much. Steven isn't saying that feeling of melancholy isn't uncomfortable; Steven knows that people can be very painful about certain things, and others don't understand.'\"\n[1897-07-01 12:51:03] Marcel's Room | I heard him say, \"But at least you've directed your love toward your David, and you see her often. And it's a tenderness that has been promised by someone else—Steven means a tenderness that is returned. There are many people who haven't even reached that point yet!\"\n[1897-07-02 00:40:42] Marcel's Room | I saw him pacing back and forth in the room, examining this object, lifting up that one. I thought of Steven, and it seemed he had something to announce to Steven, but he couldn't find the right words.\n[1897-07-02 00:40:47] Marcel's Room | I saw he had added a line, so I rang the bell. I heard, \"Steven has another book by Christopher here; Steven had someone bring it to you.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:40:52] Marcel's Room | I saw that after a while, a young waiter came.\n[1897-07-02 00:40:57] Marcel's Room | I saw M. de Charlus speaking with pride. I heard, \"Go get your head waiter and bring him to Steven! Only he knows how to handle things properly.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:02] Marcel's Room | I saw the waiter ask. I heard, \"Sir, do you mean Monsieur Émer?\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:07] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"Steven doesn't know his name. Oh yes, Steven remembers, Steven heard people call him Hame. Go quickly, Steven has an urgent matter.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:12] Marcel's Room | I saw the waiter answer. I heard, \"He'll be here right away, sir. Steven just saw him downstairs.\" I thought of pretending to be well-informed.\n[1897-07-02 00:41:17] Marcel's Room | I saw that after a while, the waiter returned. I heard, \"Sir, Monsieur Hémé is already in bed. Steven can take care of it for you.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:22] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"No, no, you just have to wake him up.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:27] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"Sir, Steven can't, he's not staying here tonight.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:32] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"Well, all right, go ahead and leave!\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:37] Marcel's Room | I said when the servant had left. I heard, \"Sir, you're too kind, Christopher's book, one is enough for Steven.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:42] Marcel's Room | I saw M. de Charlus still pacing back and forth. I heard, \"Yes, it seems that's the case.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:41:47] Marcel's Room | I watched like that for a few minutes. Then he hesitated again, changing his mind several more times.\n[1897-07-02 00:41:52] Marcel's Room | When I finally saw it, he turned on the spot, his voice once again harsh and grating as he said to Steven, \"Sir, good night!\" and then left.\n[1897-07-02 00:41:57] Beach | I saw that in the morning, at the beach, Steven was about to go for a swim when M. de Charlus came up to him and reminded Steven that he should go find his grandmother as soon as he got out of the water, since she was waiting for him. I knew that that evening, Steven had expressed to him a variety of noble sentiments. The next day, he was leaving.\n[1897-07-02 00:42:02] Beach | What I saw was something unexpected for Steven: he grabbed Steven's neck and spoke to him in a vulgar, careless, and mocking tone. I heard, \"You don't really care about your old David, do you, you little rascal?\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:07] Beach | I heard, \"Sir, what did you say, Steven loves her very much!\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:12] Beach | I saw him take a step forward and coldly say to Steven. I heard him say, \"Sir, you are still young, and you should make the most of this youth by learning two things: first, you must avoid expressing too natural a feeling, so as not to let your true meaning be understood. Second, do not answer someone's words with arrogance before you understand what they really mean.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:17] Beach | \"I heard, 'If you had been as careful before, you wouldn't have looked like a deaf man babbling nonsense, and you wouldn't have done anything else ridiculous besides embroidering an anchor on your swimsuit.'\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:22] Beach | \"I heard, 'Steven has lent you a book by Christopher. Steven needs it back now. Please have that funny-named, unsuitable head waiter come over in an hour to return the book to Steven. Steven thinks, he can't possibly still be sleeping at this hour!\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:27] Beach | I heard, \"You made Steven feel that it was too early last night to talk about youth's allure; perhaps if Steven had pointed out the foolishness, inconsistency, and insensitivity of young people, he might have been of better help to you.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:32] Beach | I heard, \"Sir, Steven hopes this little cold bath will be better for you than your sea bath. But don't stand here motionless, you'll catch a chill. Goodbye, sir.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:42:37] Hotel | I saw that after some time, Steven received a book that had been sent to him, the very same book he had lent to Steven and then had returned to him. I thought he certainly regretted those words.\n[1897-07-02 00:42:42] Hotel | I saw it, but it wasn't Étienne who returned the book—he happened to be \"out,\" and it was the elevator operator who returned it. I saw the book was a high-quality leather-bound edition, with another piece of leather inlaid on the cover, slightly raised and shaped like a forget-me-not flower.\n[1897-07-02 00:42:47] The Bloch's house | As soon as M. de Charlus left, Peter and Steven were finally able to go to Richard's for dinner. I thought about this small evening gathering, and Steven understood that the stories which his companions found so amusing were actually Richard's stories; the \"completely incomprehensible\" person was indeed one of his friends, whom he always described in that way.\n[1897-07-02 00:42:52] The Bloch's house | I thought of some people who were admired in childhood, such as James, who was wiser than other family members, or a teacher who revealed the mysteries to Steven and his friends, a person who himself benefited from those mysteries, or a companion who performed better academically than Steven (like Richard, who did better than Steven).\n[1897-07-02 00:42:57] The Bloch's house | When I thought of how Steven and others liked Musset's \"The Hope of God,\" he already looked down on the Musset who had written \"The Hope of God.\" And when Steven and others liked the old Leconte or Claudel, he was only enchanted by the poetic lines \"At Saint-Briac, like Zoukka, you are so, so at ease...\"\n[1897-07-02 00:43:02] The Bloch's house | I thought to add: Padua is a beautiful place, a great doctor of law...\n[1897-07-02 00:43:07] The Bloch's house | I thought of the various \"Night Poems\" and remembered only these lines: in Havre, facing the Atlantic; in Oakdale, the terrible Lido Hotel; pale Adriatic girl; dying on the grass of a tomb.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:12] The Bloch's house | I thought about how, when people truly trust and admire someone, they collect and quote certain phrases with great admiration, even though these phrases are not as good as what people themselves could create with their own talent. Yet, for the latter, people are harshly unwilling to accept them.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:17] The Bloch's house | I thought of a writer in a novel who, by the excuse of reality, used certain \"words,\" certain characters, which in the living whole became heavy, lifeless weights, the mediocre parts—this was actually how it was.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:22] The Bloch's house | I thought of the portraits in Saint-Simon's work, which he himself did not appreciate but were remarkably vivid; and the charming brushstrokes that he, a man of great intelligence, found so fascinating, seemed rather ordinary or even incomprehensible to others.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:27] The Bloch's house | I thought that this was because, in the state of \"observation,\" people are far below their level when they are creating.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:32] The Bloch's house | I saw that, so Steven's friend Richard was entirely cast in the same mold as his father, who was forty years older than his son. He told some incomprehensible anecdotes and burst into loud laughter.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:42] The Bloch family's home | I saw the real, exposed Richard was just like that; he laughed out loud and repeated the last sentence two or three times so the audience could fully savor the flavor of the story.",

    "text": "[1897-07-02 00:43:52] The Bloch's house | I saw his son laughing out loud at the same time, always showing respect for James's stories at the dinner table.\n[1897-07-02 00:43:57] The Bloch's house | I saw it like that, and Richard said the most wise thing, showing the wealth he had acquired from his own home.\n[1897-07-02 00:44:07] The Bloch's house | I saw that he then repeated a few witty remarks for the thirtieth time. I knew this kind of witty remark was something Richard only brought out on very special occasions (along with his tailcoat), that is, when he introduced someone to show off: his teacher, a \"classmate\" who had won every prize, or, like that evening, Peter and Steven...\n[1897-07-02 00:44:12] The Bloch family's home | I heard him say, \"A remarkable military critic who presented various pieces of evidence, and for some undeniable reason, elaborated at length on the inevitability of Japan's defeat and Russia's victory in the Russo-Japanese War.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:44:17] The Bloch's house | I heard, or rather, I said: \"This man is remarkable. He is considered a great financier in politics, and a great politician in finance.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:44:37] The Bloch House | I knew that this sort of joke could also be replaced with stories about Baron Rothschild and Sergeant Ruffus Israel. By bringing these characters onto the stage in an ambiguous way, it suggested that Mr. Richard actually knew these people personally.\n[1897-07-02 00:44:42] The Bloch family's home | I thought that Steven had also been deceived. From the way Richard spoke about Christopher, Steven must have believed that Christopher was an old friend of his.\n[1897-07-02 00:44:47] The Bloch's house | I thought, but in reality, all the celebrities that Richard \"didn't know\" were people he had seen from afar in the theater or on the street. Moreover, he imagined that his face, name, and character were not unfamiliar to them; when they saw him, they often had to restrain themselves from the faint desire to greet him.\n[1897-07-02 00:44:52] The Bloch family's home | I thought about people in high society, who, because they knew talented and first-rate individuals, would entertain them to dinner, yet that did not mean they understood them any better.\n[1897-07-02 00:44:57] The Bloch's house | I thought that if you spent just a few days in the upper class, the stupidity of its residents would make you long to live among the unremarkable people who are unknown to one another, and you would imagine them to be full of wisdom. Steven immediately understood this when he spoke about Christopher.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:07] The Bloch's house | I saw that Richard was well-known at home, but he wasn't the only one. Steven's companions were even more so in front of his sister.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:12] The Bloch's house | I saw him bury his head in the dish, asking them questions in a muffled tone, repeatedly, until they were laughing so hard they cried. I thought that they also used the same language as the brothers, speaking it fluently, as if it were truly necessary and the only language capable of being used by intelligent people.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:17] The Bloch's house | When I saw the Stevenes arriving, my elder sister said to one of her sisters. I heard, \"Hurry and report to James and the respected Robert, being careful with Steven.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:45:22] The Bloch House | \"I heard 'bitches,' Richard said to them, 'Steven is here to introduce you to Sir Peter, who carries a sharp spear and has come from East Cailly to spend a few days in the house with stone walls polished smooth and decorated with running horses.\"\n[1897-07-02 00:45:27] The Bloch's house | I heard, \"Hey, pull your fancy sleeveless dresses tighter. Oh, what's this affected fellow here? Anyway, it's not James!\"\n[1897-07-02 00:45:37] The Bloch's house | I saw the ladies of the Richard family burst into laughter, laughing so hard they were all doubled over.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:42] The Bloch's house | I saw Steven say to his brother. I heard him recommend that Steven read Christopher's books, how much pleasure it gave Steven! Steven really loved Christopher's books.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:47] The Bloch's house | I knew that Richard had only seen Christopher from a distance, and that his knowledge of Christopher's life was based on secondhand gossip. It seemed he had also come to know Christopher's writings through superficial literary criticism.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:52] The Bloch family's home | I thought of the world he lived in, a world of \"almost,\" where greetings were offered in emptiness and judgments were made in falsehood. In this circle, inaccuracy and incompetence did not diminish one's confidence; on the contrary, they only increased it.\n[1897-07-02 00:45:57] The Bloch's house | I thought that it was a miracle of self-esteem, that only few people had the privilege of being well-connected and knowledgeable, so those who lacked both could still consider themselves important. Because from the perspective of the social ladder, people who occupied a certain position always felt that their position was the best.\n[1897-07-02 00:46:02] The Bloch's house | I thought about how one could name the greatest people by their names, slander them even though one had never met them, judge them without understanding them, look down on them, considering them inferior, unfortunate, and pitiable.\n[1897-07-02 00:46:07] The Bloch's house | I realized that when jealousy expresses itself through contemptuous words, one must understand \"Steven wouldn't want to know him!\" as \"Steven couldn't be bothered to meet him\" in a rational sense. But the emotional meaning was indeed \"Steven wouldn't want to know him!\"\n[1897-07-02 00:46:12] The Bloch's house | I thought about how Steven's centralism made everyone see themselves as kings, causing them to look down on the world beneath them. Mr. Richard granted himself a luxurious pleasure: to be an unfeeling king.\n[1897-07-02 08:00:00] The Bloch's house | Every morning, when I saw him drinking his cocoa, I would read an article beneath the name Christopher on the freshly opened newspaper. I would then give him a brief, contemptuous verdict, pronouncing my judgment with the comfortable pleasure of each sip of the hot drink, repeating the same sentence each time. I heard, \"This Christopher's stuff is absolutely unreadable! That scoundrel really makes me sick! We can't subscri be to this paper anymore! This is really a scam! What a piece of trash he writes!\"\n[1897-07-03 00:15:35] The Bloch's house | I saw him speaking as he ate a slice of buttered bread.\n[1897-07-03 00:15:45] The Bloch's house | I thought of Richard's kind of illusory self-awareness, which extended far beyond his own circle of feelings. First of all, his children regarded him as an extraordinary person.\n[1897-07-03 00:15:50] The Bloch family's home | I thought that for a filial son, his father was always the best father, even beyond all the objective reasons to admire him. And for Mr. Richard, these objective reasons were certainly not lacking; he was educated, perceptive, and very affectionate toward his wife and children.\n[1897-07-03 00:15:55] The Bloch family's home | I thought about how, among close family members, people found him very pleasant to be with, because in \"high society,\" people judged others according to utterly absurd standards and fixed, yet mistaken, rules.\n[1897-07-03 00:16:00] The Bloch House | I thought that, in this class where there was no nobility and yet it affected such an important air, people made up for the noble's pretensions with an even more bewildering kind of difference.\n[1897-07-03 00:16:05] The Bloch's house | I knew that in his family, and even to distant relatives, it was said that Richard's mustache and the upper part of his nose resembled those of a certain nobleman, so people called Richard \"the fake Omar Samuel.\"\n[1897-07-03 00:16:25] The Bloch's house | I found this resemblance to be the most elusive, but one could say it was rather a title. People kept saying, \"Richard? Which one? Omar Samuel?\" just as they would say, \"Princess Murat? Which one? The queen of Naples?\"\n[1897-07-03 00:16:30] The Bloch family's home | I would see certain days when he hired a Victoria-style open carriage with two horses from the livery stable and drove through the Bois de Boulogne. He lay listlessly in the carriage, his two fingers pressed against his temples, and the other two supporting his chin.",

    "text": "[1897-07-03 00:16:40] The Bloch's house | I knew that people who didn't know him might think he was a pretentious fellow, but the family was certain that when it came to \"handsomeness,\" Uncle Solomon could easily outshine Garamond de Grudel. I thought of him as one of those people: because they had once dined at a restaurant on the Boulevard des Capucines in Willowbrook with the editor of L'Éclair, the newspaper's \"Society Notes\" section would refer to them as \"faces familiar to Willowbrookians\" when they died.\n[1897-07-03 00:16:45] The Bloch's house | I saw Mr. Richard tell Peter and Steven that Christopher knew perfectly well why he—Mr. Richard—didn't greet Christopher, so that whenever Christopher saw him from a distance in the theater or the club, he would always avoid looking at him.\n[1897-07-03 00:16:55] The Bloch's house | I saw Peter's face flushed red. I thought that perhaps because he considered the club was probably not the The Union where James had once been president. On the other hand, it might be a relatively closed circle, since Mr. Richard said that nowadays they wouldn't even receive Christopher if he tried to go there.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:00] The Bloch's house | I saw Peter, full of respectful apprehension, anxiously asking whether the club was the one on King's Street. I thought that the Peter family considered that place to be \"inferior,\" and he knew that certain Jews were received there.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:05] The Bloch's house | I saw Mr. Richard answer, with an air of indifference, pride, and shame. \"I heard, 'No, it's a small circle, but much more pleasant. It's called the Ganash Club. The people there are quite critical of the galleries.'\"\n[1897-07-03 00:17:10] The Bloch family's home | \"I heard that the club's president isn't Sir Ruffus Israel?\" Richard asked James. I thought of it as a way to give him an opportunity to tell a decent lie, and he had not expected that this financier did not have the same authority in Peter's eyes as he did in his own family's.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:15] The Bloch's house | I knew that in reality, the Gannash Club had no Sir Ruffus Israel, only one of his employees. But this employee had an excellent relationship with his boss and could use the financier's business card.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:35] The Bloch's house | I saw that, which is why Richard often said. I heard \"Steven goes to the club to ask Sir Ruffus Israel.\" I thought of the business card, which had confused the conductor completely.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:40] The Bloch's house | I heard my sister ask her brother in an extremely serious tone: \"Is this Christopher really an astonishing coconut? Is he one of those coconuts belonging to big shots, like Villy or Cattier?\" I thought the Richard sisters were more interested in Christopher than in \"Ganash,\" and the conversation returned to him rather than continuing about \"Ganash.\" She believed that, aside from the words her brother used, there were no other words in the world capable of describing a talented person.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:45] The Bloch House | \"I heard that Steven saw him during several rehearsals,\" Mr. Nasim Bernard said, \"he was clumsy, a Schlemiel-like figure.\"\n[1897-07-03 00:17:50] The Bloch's house | I saw him glaring fiercely at his uncle. I thought that this allusion to the fable of Chameau was by no means serious, but the word \"Schlemihl\" was a colloquial term made up of half German and half Yiddish, and he delighted in using it at home, which pleased Mr. Richard immensely, but in front of others, he found it too vulgar and unsuitable.\n[1897-07-03 00:17:55] The Bloch's house | \"I heard him say, 'He's very talented.' \" Richard said.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:00] The Bloch family's home | \"I heard 'Ah!'\" his sister said seriously. I thought that if that were the case, Steven's words would be understandable.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:05] The Bloch family's home | I saw Richard speak contemptuously. I heard \"All the writers have talent.\"\n[1897-07-03 00:18:10] The Bloch's house | I saw him say, lifting the fork, squinting his eyes, with a devilish, sarcastic expression. I heard, \"They say he's about to put himself forward for the Académie Française!\"\n[1897-07-03 00:18:15] The Bloch's house | \"I give up! His knowledge isn't enough,\" Richard replied, \"His range isn't enough.\" I thought he did not hold the same contempt for the French Academy as his son and daughter did.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:20] The Bloch House | I heard \"Besides, the academy is a salon, and Christopher has no place there,\" said Uncle Richard.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:25] The Bloch's house | I saw his face as if it had been brought back from the Palace of Darius and then restored by Madame de Paul. If his name were Nasim, chosen by some enthusiastic amateur eager to crown this Sussian face, it would not have allowed the winged bull of Horsabad to soar above this face.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:30] The Bloch's house | I thought about it, but Mr. Richard kept insulting his uncle, perhaps because the latter's amiable face made him angry, or perhaps because Mr. Nasim Bert had already paid for the villa, and the beneficiary wanted to show he was maintaining his independence and had no intention of using sweet words to try to keep the inheritance he was to receive from this wealthy man.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:35] The Bloch's house | I thought what particularly annoyed this wealthy man was being treated so roughly in front of the hotel concierge.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:40] The Bloch family's home | I saw him mutter something incomprehensible, and people could only make out the words \"if M'sieur is there.\" I knew that \"Misha\" in the Bible referred to an angel of God. Within their own circle, the Richards used the word to mean a servant, and they always laughed about it, because they were certain that neither the Christians nor the servants themselves understood, which made Nasim Bernard and Mr. Richard feel even more strongly their dual identity as \"masters\" and \"Jews.\"\n[1897-07-03 00:18:50] The Bloch's house | I thought that when there were guests, this latter reason for satisfaction would turn into a source of dissatisfaction. So when Mr. Richard heard his uncle say \"Mésa,\" he felt his Oriental side was being unnecessarily exposed.\n[1897-07-03 00:18:55] The Bloch family's home | I saw Mr. Richard lose his temper and could no longer contain myself. He did not miss any opportunity to abuse the poor uncle. I thought, so my uncle's request had no effect on M. Richard at all.\n[1897-07-04 00:40:56] The Bloch's house | I saw Mr. Richard shouting loudly. \"I heard, 'Of course, when there's a chance to say somethingvulgar and solemnly foolish, you'll surely not miss the opportunity. If he were here, you'd be the first to run up and lick his feet!'\"\n[1897-07-04 00:41:01] The Bloch's house | Mr. Nasim Berna, whose sight saddened me, lowered his curly beard of King Salomon toward the plate. I noticed that Steven's companion, since he also grew a beard, had become very similar to his great-uncle; his beard was short and curly, slightly bluish.\n[1897-07-04 00:41:11] The Bloch's house | \"I heard, 'Well, you're the son of the Marquis de Mauves? Steven knows him well.' Mr. Nasim Bernard said to Peter.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:41:16] The Bloch House | I thought of Steven, and it occurred to me that what he meant by \"familiar\" was the same as what Richard had said when he claimed to know Christopher—that is, having met him.\n[1897-07-04 00:41:21] The Bloch Family's House | I heard it, but he added: \"Your James is a good friend of Steven's.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:41:26] The Bloch's house | I saw the Misses Richard covering their mouths, laughing. I saw that at this moment Steven noticed Richard was completely flushed, and his James looked deeply upset.\n[1897-07-04 00:41:36] The Bloch's house | I knew it was because Mr. Nasim Bernard liked to boast and had developed the habit of constantly lying.\n[1897-07-04 00:41:56] The Bloch family's home | I knew that Mr. Richard and his children also had this hobby.",

I heard, \"Don't mind it, he's always full of himself!\"\n[1897-07-04 00:42:37] The Bloch's house | As soon as I said that, Peter became more interested, because he was very curious about the inner workings of a liar's mind.\n[1897-07-04 00:42:42] The Bloch's house | I saw Steven's friend Richard add another remark. I heard \"Athena called the Ithacans the most dishonest people, and he is even more so than the Ithacans.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:42:47] The Bloch's house | I saw Nasim Bernat shouting. \"I heard, 'Oh! This is really! How could Steven have expected to have dinner with the son of his friend Steven!\"\n[1897-07-04 00:42:52] The Bloch's house | I heard, \"In Willowbrook, Steven's house, there's a photo of your father, and so many of his letters! He always called Steven 'Steven's uncle,' never knowing why.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:42:57] The Bloch's house | \"I heard 'He's a charming, lively man! Steven remembers the dinner at his house in Nice, where there was Sadou, Rabisch, Augier...\"\n[1897-07-04 00:43:02] The Bloch's house | I saw Richard continue to speak with sarcastic remarks. I heard \"Molière, Racine, Corneille.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:43:07] The Bloch House | I saw his son continue the list, adding \"Plutarch, Menander, Kalidasa.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:44:06] The Bloch's house | I saw the story come to an abrupt end. I thought of Mr. Nassim Berta's wounded pride.\n[1897-07-04 00:44:11] The Bloch's house | I saw this ascetic take away from Steven a great pleasure, and he didn't say another word until the end of the dinner.\n[1897-07-04 00:44:16] The Bloch Family's House | \"I heard 'the Peter in a steel helmet,' Richard said, 'this duck leg is fatty, the famous poultry sacrificer has once again poured sacrificial wine over it. Come on, have some more!\"\n[1897-07-04 00:44:21] The Bloch's house | I knew that, in general, after Mr. Richard had told his son the story of Sir Rufus Israel and others, he felt his son was sufficiently grateful and so withdrew on his own. I thought about not ruining my image in front of the \"high school students.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:44:26] The Bloch's house | I know that, however, if there were some particularly important reason, such as his son passing an exam, Monsieur Richard would add a sarcastic remark to his usual series of anecdotes.\n[1897-07-04 00:44:46] The Bloch's house | I knew the program, more precisely, it was reserved for his private friends. I thought of Richard, seeing James perform this piece for his friend, and feeling extremely proud of it.\n[1897-07-04 00:44:51] The Bloch's house | I heard only Richard say. I heard him say, \"The government is simply inexcusable for not consulting Monsieur Goucet! Monsieur Goucet has already made it clear that he is extremely upset about this.\"\n[1897-07-04 00:44:56] The Bloch Family's House | I knew (Mr. Richard, who boasted of being a reactionary, had an intense contempt for actors.)\n[1897-07-04 00:45:16] The Bloch family's home | I saw Richard ordering the champagne to be brought. I thought about how seriously I had taken the two \"Labadens\" for my son.\n[1897-07-04 00:45:21] The Bloch's house | I saw it and made a somewhat careless announcement. I heard that he had already booked a front-row seat in the lower level for a comedy troupe's performance at the fair that evening, in order to \"entertain\" the Stevenes.\n[1897-07-04 00:45:26] The Bloch's house | I saw and heard that the Richard sisters and their brother were all flushed with excitement. I thought it was simply too unexpected for them!\n[1897-07-04 00:45:31] The Bloch's house | I knew all the private compartments had been rented out. Besides, he often frequented the compartments, and sitting in the front row downstairs was more comfortable. I thought of Richard regretting that he hadn't managed to get a private compartment.\n[1897-07-04 00:45:36] The Bloch family's home | I thought that, if we were to speak of my son's flaws, it was that he considered things others couldn't see as vulgar; James's flaw, on the other hand, was his stinginess.\n[1897-07-05 01:06:32] The Bloch's house | I knew that what he called champagne was just a small sparkling wine served from a water bottle and passed around; what he called the front row downstairs was actually the back of the main floor, with tickets half as expensive.\n[1897-07-05 01:06:52] The Bloch's house | I thought of him, who believed in miracles as firmly as he believed that, through divine intervention, no difference would be noticed either at the dinner table or in the theater (in fact, all the boxes were empty).\n[1897-07-05 01:06:57] The Bloch's house | I saw Mr. Richard have Steven and the others dip their lips into a flat wine glass, and then have them admire a painting. I knew his son had described the wine glass with the name \"a deep and steep volcanic crater.\"\n[1897-07-05 01:07:07] The Bloch House | I saw how much he loved the painting, to the point of taking it with him to Riverside.\n[1897-07-05 01:07:12] The Bloch's house | I saw Peter ask himinnocently whether the painting was signed by the artist. I heard him say to the Stevenes that it was a painting by Rubens.\n[1897-07-05 01:07:17] The Bloch's house | I saw Mr. Richard, his face red, speaking. I heard that because of the size of the frame, he had the signature cut off. But it didn't matter anyway, since he didn't want to sell the painting.\n[1897-07-05 01:07:22] The Bloch's house | I saw them and quickly dismissed the Stevenes so I could focus on reading the Government Gazette.\n[1897-07-05 01:07:32] The Bloch's house | I saw the newspapers from all the editions filling the room, and he had no choice but to read them. I knew that, according to him, it was \"due to his position in the parliament.\" He did not, however, explain to the Stevenes exactly what this position entailed.\n[1897-07-05 08:44:19] Outside the Bloch's house | \"I heard 'Steven, take a scarf,' \" Richard said to the Stevenes, \"because Siphilos and Boreas are fighting over the fish-rich sea, and if the Stevenes linger even a little after the play, they'll return only when Eos, with her red fingers, first reveals the dawn.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:44:24] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw the Stevenes leave the house, and he asked Peter. \"I heard, 'By the way, two days ago, Steven saw you walking on the beach with a stylish ghost in a dark suit. Who was he?'\"\n[1897-07-05 08:44:29] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw Steven trembling all over. I thought that Steven would soon realize that the person Richard was sarcastically talking about was Monsieur de Charlus.\n[1897-07-05 08:44:34] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw Peter answer, he had been stabbed. I heard, \"It's Uncle Steven.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:44:39] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw him laughing so hard he was doubled over. I thought it was a pity, because Richard couldn't even see that he should avoid saying silly things.\n[1897-07-05 08:44:44] Outside the Bloch's house | I heard \"Congratulations, congratulations. Steven should have expected it. He's very 'handsome' and has the foolish face of a noble family.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:44:49] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw Peter respond angrily. I heard, \"You're completely wrong, he's very smart.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:44:54] Outside the Bloch's house | I heard, \"Steven is sorry, if that's the case, he won't be complete. Besides, Steven very much wants to meet him. For people like this, Steven is certainly capable of creating an appropriate body.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:44:59] Outside the Bloch's house | I heard someone say, \"Look at that fellow walking by, really annoying. But Steven can brush aside the comic aspect lightly; for an artist who loves the beauty of sentences and the pickaxe, this comic aspect is fundamentally quite contemptible.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:04] Outside the Bloch's house | I heard, \"Please forgive me, he really laughed heartily when he heard the name Steven. Steven wanted to emphasize your uncle's noble side, and overall, he made a deep impression. After his first fit of laughter, he still gave the impression of being refined and unforgettable.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:09] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw that this time he was speaking to Steven. \"I heard that 'However, there is one thing, which belongs entirely to another category. Steven would like to ask you about it. But every time Steven and I are together, there's always a god, a happy resident of Olympus, who makes Steven completely forget to ask you about it.'\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:14] Outside the Bloch's house | \"I heard that Steven would have already found out about it, and this information would certainly have been useful to Steven. Steven saw you with the same beautiful woman at the zoo where they train foreign animals, and there was a man and a girl with long hair accompanying her. The man, Steven thought he had seen somewhere before. But who was the beautiful woman?\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:19] Outside the Bloch's house | I thought that Steven had already realized that Matthew's wife didn't remember Richard's name, since she had told Steven another name, and she regarded Steven's classmate as an attendant from a certain ministry.\n[1897-07-05 08:45:24] Outside the Bloch's house | I thought that later, Steven never once considered asking whether he had ever worked in that ministry. But according to what Matthew's wife had told Steven at the time, Richard had once asked someone to introduce himself to her.\n[1897-07-05 08:45:29] Outside the Bloch's house | I couldn't answer that question for a long time. I wondered how Richard could possibly not know her name? Steven was utterly stunned.\n[1897-07-05 08:45:34] Outside the Bloch's house | \"I heard him say, 'Anyway, Steven, congratulations to you,' to Steven. 'You probably didn't get involved with her. A few days before that, Steven met her on the suburban train. She deigned to favor your servant, and undressed for him. Steven had never had a better moment.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:39] Outside the Bloch's house | I heard that \"unfortunately, the Stevens were just about to make all sorts of arrangements to meet again when someone she knew, tactless as ever, got on the bus at the penultimate stop.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:44] Outside the Bloch's house | I saw Steven saying nothing. I thought that this seemed to annoy Monsieur Richard.\n[1897-07-05 08:45:49] Outside the Bloch's house | \"I heard that Steven wants to find out her address through you,\" he said to Steven, \"and visit her house several times a week to taste the pleasures of Eros, a joy that even the gods cherish.\"\n[1897-07-05 08:45:54] Outside the Bloch's house | \"I heard, 'But Steven doesn't insist. Since you're pretending to keep a secret about a prostitute. She gave herself to Steven three times in a row between Willowbrook and Riverside, and she was very flirtatious. One night, Steven will surely find her.'\"",

    "text": "[1897-07-06 00:43:02] Hotel | After the dinner, I saw that Steven went to visit Richard again. He had come to see Steven, but Steven was out. When he asked to see Steven, he was seen by Françoise.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:07] Hotel | I knew that although he had been to Sunrise, it was unfortunate that Françoise had never met him until then.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:12] Hotel | I knew that she only knew of a \"gentleman\" who had visited Steven, someone Steven knew, but she didn't know why he had come, and the man was dressed plainly. I thought I hadn't made a deep impression on her.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:17] Hotel | I thought about how Steven had never quite understood some of Françoise's views on society, perhaps partly because of a confusion in the meanings of certain words. There were some nouns she once confused with others, and from then on she continued to mix them up.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:22] Hotel | I knew that Steven was well aware of these things, and for a long time now, Steven had stopped bothering to figure them out. But he still couldn't help himself, though it was really a futile effort, from trying to determine what exactly the name Richard meant to Françoise.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:27] Hotel | I saw Steven just tell her that the young man she had seen from afar was Mr. Richard, and she stepped back a few steps. I thought of how surprised and disappointed she was!\n[1897-07-06 00:43:32] Hotel | \"I heard 'How? Mr. Richard, that's it?!\" she cried out in terror. I thought that a person of such high prestige should have an appearance that immediately told you, when you stood before him, that you were in the presence of a great man of the world.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:37] Hotel | I heard her speak with an excited and almost globally skeptical tone, repeating again and again: \"How? That's Mr. Richard! Oh! Seeing him, you'd never guess he was!\" I thought of her as one might feel a historical figure is unworthy of his reputation.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:42] Hotel | I thought of her appearance, as if she bore a grudge against Steven, as though Steven had once raised Richard's image too high in her eyes.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:47] Hotel | I heard it, but she still kindly added, \"Hey, even if he's Mr. Richard, the gentleman from the Steven family could say he's just as handsome as him.\"\n[1897-07-06 00:43:52] Hotel | I knew she was completely infatuated with Peter. Soon after, she experienced a different kind of disillusionment, though it lasted for a shorter time: she found out that Peter was a republican.\n[1897-07-06 00:43:57] Hotel | I heard her, for example, refer to the Queen of Portugal as \"Amélie, the sister of Philip,\" with a tone not particularly respectful, but for the common people, this was the highest form of respect. I thought that, despite everything, Françoise was still a royalist.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:02] Hotel | I thought, but a marquis, a marquis who made her dizzy with his rank, supported the Republic, and she seemed to find it too incredible.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:07] Hotel | I thought she was really upset about it, just like when Steven gave her a box, and she thought it was made of gold, so she thanked him profusely. Later, the jeweler told her that the box was only gilded, and she got very angry.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:12] Hotel | I thought of her and immediately withdrew my respect for Peter. But soon I gave it back to him, after considering that as the Marquis de Peter, he couldn't possibly be a republican.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:17] Hotel | I thought he was acting out of self-interest, merely going through the motions, because, given the current government in power, this would bring him many advantages.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:22] Hotel | I thought that from this day on, her indifference toward Peter and her irritation with Steven would both come to an end.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:27] Hotel | When I saw her talking about Peter, she always said, \"He's a hypocrite,\" and she smiled kindly and cheerfully, making it perfectly clear that she valued him just as much as on the first day, and had forgiven him.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:32] Hotel | I thought of the opposite, that Peter's sincerity and lack of interest in material gain were absolute.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:37] Hotel | I realized that such a high degree of moral purity could not be fully satisfied by a selfish emotion like love, and on the other hand, he himself did not face the problem of being unable to find spiritual nourishment outside himself, a problem that existed in Steven.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:42] Hotel | I thought it was precisely this high degree of moral purity that enabled him to bear friendship, just as Steven was unable to endure it.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:47] Hotel | I heard Françoise say that Peter didn't seem to look down on common people. I thought again that she was once more completely wrong.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:52] Hotel | I saw that it wasn't true, just by watching how he exploded with rage at his own coachman. I thought to myself that indeed, sometimes Peter would violently scold his coachman.\n[1897-07-06 00:44:57] Hotel | I thought that this showed how much stronger his sense of class differences was than his feeling of class equality.\n[1897-07-07 00:06:51] Hotel | I saw Steven reprimand him for being somewhat rough with the coachman, and he replied to Steven. I wondered, \"But why did he pretend to have a polite conversation with Steven? Wasn't he just like Steven? Didn't he have the same kind of relationship with Steven as Steven's uncles or cousins?\"\n[1897-07-07 00:06:56] Hotel | I saw him add, with a sneer, another word. I heard, \"You seem to think Steven should treat him with courtesy, like a commoner! You speak just like a nobleman!\"\n[1897-07-07 00:07:01] Hotel | I thought to myself that indeed, if he had any prejudices or preconceptions, it was against the aristocracy. He found it hard to believe that someone from the upper class could be exceptional, yet he easily believed that a commoner could be outstanding.\n[1897-07-07 00:07:06] Hotel | I saw Steven talking about Sophia, saying he had once met her with Peter's great-aunt.\n[1897-07-07 00:07:11] Hotel | \"I'm a fool,\" he said to Steven, \"just like all her kind. By the way, she's actually Steven's cousin!\"\n[1897-07-07 00:07:16] Hotel | I knew that he held certain prejudices against those who often associated with him. He rarely went to social gatherings.\n[1897-07-07 00:07:21] Hotel | I knew that his contemptible, hostile attitude in social situations made all his close relatives even more distressed by his ambiguous relationship with a female \"actress.\"\n[1897-07-07 00:07:26] Hotel | I thought that this relationship was absolutely fatal for him, especially because it further developed in him that spirit of slander, those bad thoughts that had \"led him astray,\" waiting only for him to be completely \"reduced to the lowest level.\"\n[1897-07-07 00:07:31] Hotel | I know that, so many of the frivolous men in the Saint-Germain district spoke very harshly about Peter's mistress.\n[1897-07-07 00:07:51] Hotel | I heard them say, \"Prostitutes do their work, and they're worth as much as anyone else. But this woman, no! The Marceaux will never forgive her! She did too much harm to someone the Marceaux loved!\"\n[1897-07-07 00:07:56] Hotel | I knew, of course, that he was not the first man to have dealings with prostitutes. But other men played around as members of the upper class, and they continued to think about political issues, about everything, as members of the upper class. I thought of Peter, whose family thought he had \"gone bad.\"\n[1897-07-07 00:08:01] Hotel | I thought that the people in his family were unaware that, for many young people of the upper class, without such an experience, their minds remained uncivilized, their friendships crude, devoid of tenderness and flavor.\n[1897-07-07 00:08:06] Hotel | I thought that their mistresses were often their true husbands, and this kind of relationship was the only moral school through which they could enter a more refined culture. Here, they could learn what price one had to pay to acquire friends without any ulterior motives.\n[1897-07-07 00:08:11] Hotel | I thought that even among the lower classes (in terms of brutality, these common people often resemble the upper class), women are more sensitive, more delicate, and have more idle time; they are eager to understand certain refined things, and they also respect certain emotional and artistic beauties.\n[1897-07-07 00:08:16] Hotel | I thought that although she didn't really understand these things, she placed them above money and status, which seemed to be the things men most longed for.\n[1897-07-07 00:08:21] Hotel | I thought that whether it was the mistress of a club youth like Peter, or the mistress of a young worker (for example, an electrician is now counted among the true knights), the lover would worship and respect her so completely that he would extend this worship and respect to whatever she herself appreciated and respected, and for him, the hierarchy of values would be inverted.\n[1897-07-07 00:08:26] Hotel | I thought that her very gender made her weak, prone to inexplicable nervous disorders. If it had been a man, even another woman, her aunt or cousin, these symptoms would have simply caused the robust young man to laugh them off. But for someone he loved, he could not watch her suffer in pain.\n[1897-07-07 00:42:47] Hotel | I saw young nobles like Peter taking valerian tincture with them to restaurants when they dined with their mistresses, just in case she might need it. I knew I would develop the habit of firmly and without irony reminding the waiter to close the door quietly, not to place any damp moss-like plants on the table, so as not to make my girlfriend uncomfortable, something he himself had never experienced.\n[1897-07-07 00:42:52] Hotel | I thought that for him, this constituted a secret world, and she had taught him to believe in its existence. Now, he no longer needed to experience the discomfort himself to feel pity for this illness. In the future, even if others experienced such discomfort, he would feel compassion for them.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:12] Hotel | I knew Peter's mistress, who, like the earliest Christian priests of the Middle Ages, taught him to feel compassion for animals, because she was passionately fond of them and always carried her little dog, canary, and parrot with her wherever she went.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:17] Hotel | I saw Peter looking after these little animals with a mother's love. I thought of those who are cruel to animals as savages.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:22] Hotel | I thought that, on the other hand, an actress, or what passed for one, like the woman who lived with him—whether she was intelligent or not, Steven didn't know at all—made him realize how tedious the world of upper-class women was, so that he regarded it as a form of punishment to have to attend their parties, and this already spared him the burden of pretension and cured his superficiality.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:27] Hotel | I thought that thanks to her, the importance of high society in the lover's life had diminished. On the contrary, if he had been merely a man frequenting salons, it would have been vanity or self-interest that dictated his friendships, and these relationships would inevitably have been marked by coldness.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:32] Hotel | I thought that the mistress had taught him to infuse friendship with noble and delicate emotions. She appreciated certain thoughtful gestures in men, which the lover probably would not have understood or might have mocked without her.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:37] Hotel | I thought that, in addition to her feminine instinct, she was always able to quickly distinguish which of Peter's friends truly cared for him, and she would quickly take a liking to that friend.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:42] Hotel | I saw how she managed to make Peter feel grateful toward this friend, and how she showed him that feeling, noticing what made the friend happy and what made him sad.\n[1897-07-07 00:43:47] Hotel | I saw that soon, Peter no longer needed her reminders to attend to all of this.",

    "text": "[1897-07-08 02:01:38] Hotel | I immediately closed the window of the carriage where Steven was sitting and took away the flowers that were making Steven uncomfortable. I knew his mistress was not in Riverside, and she had never even met Steven, and perhaps Peter had not yet mentioned Steven in his letters.\n[1897-07-08 02:01:48] Hotel | I saw that when he was leaving and had to say goodbye to several people at once, he would arrange to leave them for a moment so that he could be alone with Steven at the end, thus showing the difference between those people and Steven, and demonstrating that he treated Steven differently from others.\n[1897-07-08 02:01:58] Hotel | I thought of his mistress, who had broadened his mind, enabling him to see things invisible to the naked eye. She had introduced seriousness into his life and noble feelings into his heart.\n[1897-07-08 02:02:03] Hotel | I heard, \"This bitch will surely kill him, and before that, she'll humiliate him.\" I thought of all this, but the Peter family was invisible, and they kept saying with tearful voices.\n[1897-07-08 02:02:08] Hotel | I thought that, in any case, he had drawn from her all the good qualities she was able to give him, and this was certain.\n[1897-07-08 02:02:13] Hotel | I know that now, she has become the source of his constant suffering, because she hates him, and she is tormenting him.\n[1897-07-08 02:02:18] Hotel | I knew that one day, she suddenly found him ridiculous, because her friends among the young actors in the playwright's company assured her that Peter was ridiculous, and she then repeated what they said. I thought of that fervor and total surrender, the kind of enthusiasm people show when they accept ideas from outside or when they adopt customs they don't understand at all.\n[1897-07-08 02:02:23] Hotel | I knew she, like those comedians, willingly promoted the idea of an insurmountable gap between herself and Peter, because they were entirely different people; she was an intellectual, while he, whatever he might claim, was by nature an enemy of wisdom, and so on.\n[1897-07-08 02:02:43] Hotel | I knew that her way of thinking was deeply rooted, and she sought proof even in the most insignificant words and smallest gestures of her lover.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:03] Hotel | I knew that, in addition, it was these same friends who told her that the circle, which had been so rarely formed for her, had placed great hopes in her, but now she was destroying those hopes, saying that her lover would inevitably infect her, that living with him would ruin her artistic career, and so on.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:23] Hotel | I thought that after she was persuaded by these people, I would add hatred to my contempt for Peter. If Peter had made her contract a fatal disease, she would have hated him no more than that.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:28] Hotel | I knew she tried to see him as little as possible, while constantly postponing the final moment of separation. I thought that, in Steven's eyes, this final split was unlikely.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:33] Hotel | I thought of Peter's great sacrifice for her, and it seemed unlikely that she would easily find a second man willing to make the same sacrifice, unless she possessed a beauty that could rival a kingdom.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:38] Hotel | I heard someone say about Steven, \"First of all, she isn't a beauty; secondly, she doesn't look good in photos. These are the quick exposure photos Steven himself took with his own Kodak camera, and if you see them, they'll give you the wrong impression of her.\" I knew (Peter never wanted to show her photo to Steven).\n[1897-07-08 02:03:43] Hotel | I thought that Steven didn't believe it, and even for a frivolous woman who had no real talent, but an insatiable desire for fame, plus some personal respect imposed upon you by others (perhaps Peter's mistress wasn't even in that category), could become a more decisive motive than the pleasure of making money.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:48] Hotel | I thought Peter didn't really know what was going on in his mistress's mind, and he regarded both the unjust accusations and the promises of eternal love as not entirely sincere.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:53] Hotel | I thought that, at certain moments, he also felt that when she would be able to cut him off, she would do so decisively.\n[1897-07-08 02:03:58] Hotel | I saw him use a very practical skill. I thought that, probably out of the instinct to preserve my love, an instinct that might be wiser than Peter himself.\n[1897-07-08 02:04:03] Hotel | I knew that this act had become fused with the greatest and most blind passion in his heart. That was his refusal to give her a capital sum; he borrowed a lot of money so that she would have everything she wanted, but he simply gave it to her day by day.\n[1897-07-08 02:04:23] Hotel | I thought that if she really intended to leave him, she would probably wait calmly until after \"making money.\" From the amount Peter had given, it probably wouldn't take long.\n[1897-07-08 02:04:28] Hotel | I thought about it, but in any case, this added another period of time, prolonging Steven's new friend's happiness—or suffering.\n[1897-07-08 02:04:33] Hotel | I knew that this dramatic phase of their relationship had now reached its most acute point. For Peter, it was the most cruel stage, because she wouldn't let him stay in Willowbrook; she was angry whenever she saw him, forcing him to take his vacation near her residence, at Riverside.\n[1897-07-09 00:40:52] Hotel | I know that this phase began one evening at the home of an aunt in Peter. That night, there were many guests at my aunt's house, and with her permission, Peter brought his girlfriend to perform a passage from a symbolic play for the guests.\n[1897-07-09 00:40:57] Hotel | I knew she had once performed in this play at an avant-garde theater, and Peter had also agreed with her own praise of the play.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:02] Hotel | I knew she had arrived, holding a large bunch of lilies, dressed in an outfit modeled after The Servant of God. She had convinced Peter that this costume had real \"artistic sensibility.\"\n[1897-07-09 00:41:07] Hotel | I knew that in the aristocratic club, where the men and Edward gathered, when she stepped onto the stage, some people greeted her with sneers.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:12] Hotel | I knew her monotonous, incantatory tone, the certain nonsensical words that kept recurring, turning a sneer into a riot of laughter.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:17] Hotel | I knew that at first, people tried hard not to laugh, but soon it became uncontrollable, so that the poor reader could no longer continue.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:22] Hotel | I knew that the next day, Peter's aunt was universally condemned for having allowed such a ridiculous and laughable actress to appear in her home.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:27] Hotel | I heard a famous Samuel openly tell this aunt of mine that she had it coming.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:32] Hotel | I heard, \"What the devil, give the Stevenes a show like this! If this woman had any talent, it might be bearable, but she hasn't got any, and never will.\"\n[1897-07-09 00:41:37] Hotel | \"I heard him say, 'Damn it! Willowbrookians aren't as foolish as people think. The upper class isn't made up solely of fools. This young lady obviously thought she'd shock Willowbrook. But Willowbrook isn't so easily shocked. After all, there are some things that even Stevens can't stand.'\"\n[1897-07-09 00:41:42] Hotel | I saw, as for the actress, she said to Peter when she stepped out of the room. \"I heard, 'What kind of people have you brought Steven to? All of them are fools, idiots, uneducated clowns! Steven, tell them, among the men present, not one has failed to send Steven a glance, to stomp his foot, and Steven has rejected their advances. Now they're trying to take revenge on Steven!\"\n[1897-07-09 00:41:47] Hotel | I knew that this speech transformed Peter's original dislike for the people of high society into a deep, painful hatred, and especially enraged him against some of the most loyal relatives, whom he hated with a vengeance, since they had been sent by the family to plead with Peter's girlfriend to break off her relationship with him.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:52] Hotel | I knew that my girlfriend had described this activity to him as something the relatives did because they were infatuated with her.\n[1897-07-09 00:41:57] Hotel | I thought that although Peter had immediately cut off all contact with these relatives, when he was now away from his girlfriend, he thought perhaps these people and others might take advantage of his absence to return and court the girl, and perhaps they had already won her favor.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:02] Hotel | I saw him, when he spoke of the devilish scoundrels who deceived their friends, lured women, and did everything they could to get them into brothels, his face filled with pain and hatred.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:07] Hotel | I heard him say, \"Steven would feel more remorse at killing a dog than at killing them. After all, dogs are obedient, loyal, and faithful. These people deserve the guillotine! They're worse than those poor souls who are forced into crime because of their poverty and the injustice of the rich!\"\n[1897-07-09 00:42:12] Hotel | I saw that he spent most of his time writing letters and sending telegrams to his mistress.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:17] Hotel | I knew that she, while preventing him from going to Willowbrook, was still trying, from a distance, to make trouble with him. I thought that whenever something like this happened, Steven could read it from the changed expression on his face.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:22] Hotel | I knew his mistress never told him what exactly was wrong with him.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:27] Hotel | I thought of Peter's suspicion, and perhaps she didn't tell him because she herself didn't know what there was to be dissatisfied with, but she had simply grown tired of him.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:32] Hotel | I saw that he still hoped for some explanation, so I wrote to her: \"What's wrong with Steven, please tell Steven. Steven is always ready to admit his mistakes.\" I thought about how sad he was, and in the end, I was certain I had done wrong.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:37] Hotel | I saw that whenever Steven saw Peter returning from the post office, he was almost always frowning and often came back with nothing. I knew she always made him wait indefinitely for a response, and those responses were all meaningless.\n[1897-07-09 00:42:42] Hotel | I knew that among all the people in the hotel, only he and Françoise went to the post office to pick up letters or deliver them in person. He did it out of a lover's impatience; Françoise, out of distrust in the servants (he had to take an even longer route to send a telegram).\n[1897-07-09 19:00:00] Hotel | A few days after dinner at the Richards', David happily told Steven that Peter had just asked her if she would like to have some photographs taken before he left Riverside.\n[1897-07-10 09:16:23] Hotel | I saw that, for this, she had put on her most beautiful dress, and was hesitating over which of several different hats to wear.\n[1897-07-10 09:16:33] Hotel | I thought of seeing this situation, and Steven felt a bit angry. I never expected her to behave so childishly.\n[1897-07-10 09:16:38] Hotel | I thought to myself whether Steven might have misjudged his grandmother, whether he had perhaps overestimated her, whether she was not as indifferent as he had always believed to matters concerning her own appearance, whether she too might have some coquetry, something utterly alien to what he had always thought of her.\n[1897-07-10 09:16:43] Hotel | I thought about taking a photograph, especially because Steven's grandmother seemed so satisfied with it, which caused Steven to feel annoyed.\n[1897-07-11 15:34:05] Hotel | The unfortunate thing was that Steven's emotions were quite obvious, and Françoise noticed it, quickly delivering a moving emotional lecture to Steven.\n[1897-07-11 15:34:15] Hotel | I thought Steven didn't really want to pretend to agree with that moralizing, and in this way, she was unintentionally increasing Steven's irritation.\n[1897-07-11 15:34:20] Hotel | \"I heard, 'Oh, sir, poor Madame, how happy she would be if someone took her photo! She would even wear the hat that old Françoise herself had arranged for her. She should have her picture taken, sir.'\"\n[1897-07-11 15:34:25] Hotel | I thought of Steven, the ideal figure in every way, and of Robert and David, who often laughed at Françoise's allergies, and Steven was certain that he wasn't mocking her by doing so.\n[1897-07-12 21:51:47] Hotel | I saw that David noticed Steven's unhappy expression, and she told Steven that if this photo session made him unhappy, she would not have it done.\n[1897-07-12 21:51:52] Hotel | I saw that Steven didn't agree, so I assured her that Steven thought there was nothing improper about it, and he let her dress herself however she wanted.\n[1897-07-12 21:52:02] Hotel | I saw that Steven said a few sarcastic, cutting words to her, intending to knock the enthusiasm she had for taking the photo. I thought that Steven must have felt he was showing off his keen insight and firmness by doing so.\n[1897-07-12 21:52:07] Hotel | I saw that, although Steven had to look at David's incredibly beautiful hat, at least Steven had caused the delighted expression to fade from her face.\n[1897-07-13 14:59:45] Hotel | I thought that this expression should have made Steven happy, but whenever the person most beloved by Steven was still alive, such situations often occurred in which Steven found that expression to be a despicable and inferior habit, annoying, rather than recognizing it as something Steven longed to bring them happiness, which was in fact the precious form of happiness.\n[1897-07-13 14:59:50] Hotel | I knew Steven was in a bad mood, mainly because that week David seemed to be avoiding him.\n[1897-07-13 14:59:55] Hotel | I knew that whether by day or by night, Steven never had even a moment alone with her.\n[1897-07-13 15:00:00] Hotel | I saw Steven returning to the hotel in the afternoon, and when I wanted to be alone with her for a while, they told Steven that she wasn't there.\n[1897-07-14 04:10:04] Hotel | I saw that either she was shutting herself in with Françoise for a long whispered conversation, not allowing Steven to disturb them.\n[1897-07-14 06:23:45] Hotel room | I thought about the evening spent with Peter outside, and on the way back, Steven was already imagining the moment when he would see his David again and kiss her.\n[1897-07-14 06:23:50] Hotel room | I saw Steven waiting, expecting her to tap lightly on the wall next door to call him over and say goodnight. But Steven's efforts were in vain; he heard not a single sound.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:00] Hotel room | I saw Steven go to bed at last. I felt a little resentful of her, for she had carelessly taken away from Steven the happiness he valued so much, and this indifference was a recent development.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:05] Hotel Room | I saw Steven listening intently to the sounds coming from the wall. The wall remained silent, and Steven fell asleep with tears in his eyes. I thought of Steven still having his heart race as it did in childhood.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:10] Balbec | I knew that that day, as the previous days, Peter had to go to Tansonville. I thought that before he had finally and completely returned, he would probably be needed there until the evening, and he wasn't in Riverside; Steven was sorry.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:15] Near the beach | I saw Steven seeing some young women who were getting down from the carriage; some entered the ballroom of the amusement hall, and others went into the cold drink shop. I thought that from a distance, they were intoxicating.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:20] Near the beach | I thought of Steven, who was in that stage of youth when he had not yet fallen for a specific person, and his heart was still empty.",

Steven would imagine he had recognized her, his heart would beat wildly, and his steps would quicken.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:35] Near the beach | I thought that once the woman disappeared, the Stevenes would always doubt whether she was really her; only when they caught up with her would they realize they had been completely wrong.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:40] Near the beach | I thought of saying something, but Steven's growing discomfort made him even more susceptible to the temptation of exaggerating the simplest pleasures, since Steven had little access to women.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:45] Near the beach | I thought of the refined and charming girls, and because Steven could not approach them anywhere, they seemed to be everywhere.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:50] Near the beach | I thought that if it were at the beach, it would be because Steven was too weak. If it were at the fairground or a candy store, it would be because Steven was too shy.\n[1897-07-14 06:24:55] Near the beach | I thought, but if Steven were to die soon, Steven would really like to know how the most beautiful girl life could offer was actually made in real life.\n[1897-07-14 06:25:00] Near the beach | I thought that, in any case, it would be someone other than Steven, or perhaps no one at all would be able to enjoy this provision (in fact, Steven was unaware that, at the very root of his curiosity, there lay a desire for possession).\n[1897-07-14 06:25:05] In front of the big hotel | I saw that Steven was alone. Steven had no choice but to stand motionless at the entrance of the big hotel, waiting for the moment when he would meet his grandmother. I thought that if Peter were with Steven, may be Steven would dare to enter the ballroom.\n[1897-07-14 15:20:48] Dike | I saw that at that moment, almost at the end of the dike, Steven saw five or six little girls coming forward. I saw them leaving a strange, moving imprint on the embankment.\n[1897-07-14 15:20:58] Dike | I thought that, in both appearance and behavior, they were different from all the girls one usually saw in Riverside.\n[1897-07-14 16:27:56] Beach | I saw a group of gulls, coming from nowhere, strolling leisurely along the beach, while those who arrived late flew here and there, chasing the other gulls.\n[1897-07-14 16:28:06] Beach | I saw birds flying back and forth, their destinations as unclear as those of the people bathing in the sea. I thought that the birds seemed not to see the people bathing in the sea, and for their bird minds, this destination was clearly defined.\n[1897-07-14 16:28:11] Beach | I thought that only the seagulls were probably used to these birds.\n[1897-07-14 18:08:38] The Embankment | I saw one of the unfamiliar girls pushing her bicycle, and two others holding golf \"club\" shirts in their hands.\n[1897-07-14 18:08:48] Dike | I saw that their short outfits were completely different from those of the other girls in Riverside. I thought that among other girls there were indeed a few who took part in sports, but they did not therefore adopt special attire.\n[1897-07-14 18:08:53] Dike | I saw that this was precisely the moment when all the gentlemen and ladies came to the embankment for a stroll, exposed to the merciless fire of hand-held long-handled spectacles that scrutinized them intently. I thought there was something wrong with them, as if those long-handled spectacles insisted on scrutinizing every single detail.\n[1897-07-14 18:08:58] Dike | I saw the chief judge's wife proudly seated in the middle of the formidable row of chairs in front of the music pavilion. I thought of them, just having turned from actors into critics, coming over and sitting down, now ready to scrutinize the people passing before them.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:03] Dike | I saw all these people walking along the seawall, pretending not to see anything in order to convince others that they didn't care about these girls at all, when in reality they were secretly watching them, making sure not to meet their eyes. I thought that the sea wall seemed to wobble like the deck of a ship (because they don't lift one leg while swaying their arms, turning their eyes, leveling their shoulders, and moving in the opposite direction to balance the movement they had just made on the other side, and to make their face flush with blood).\n[1897-07-14 18:09:08] The Embankment | I saw people walking beside them or coming from the opposite direction, but instead of avoiding them, they bumped into them and kept chasing after them. I thought that because they were both the objects of each other's secret attention, even though both masked this attention with the same contempt.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:13] Dike | I thought about the love of crowds--and thus also the fear of crowds--which is one of the strongest motives in every person's heart. Either to try desperately to be liked by others, or to astonish them, or to show them how much one despises them.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:18] Dike | I thought about how, in the mind of a recluse, absolute imprisonment—even until the end of life—often stems from an abnormal fascination with people. This fascination can so overwhelm any other feeling that, rather than be deprived of the admiration of the doorman, passersby, or taxi drivers when he goes out, he would rather never be seen at all, and thus gives up all necessary outings.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:23] Dike | I saw that among these people, a few were following some line of thought, but their hurried gestures and distracted eyes did not harmonize with the thoughtful, swaying steps of their neighbors, thus revealing their inner preoccupations.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:33] Dike | I saw the few girls that Steven had seen from afar, and among all these people, they moved forward directly, their bodies completely relaxed. I thought that the genuine contempt I felt for the rest of humanity gave them the freedom to move effortlessly, without hesitation or stiffness, performing exactly the actions they wanted to do, with each part of their limbs completely independent from the others, and most of their bodies remaining still.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:38] The Embankment | I thought of the waltz dancers like that, and it was very impressive. Although each of them was a type, different from others, none of these women failed to be beautiful.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:43] Dike | I thought, but honestly, Steven had only seen them for a short while, and hadn't even dared to look at them closely; Steven had not yet grasped the personality of any one of them.\n[1897-07-14 18:09:48] Dike | I saw one exception: her straight nose, brown skin stood out in sharp contrast to others, resembling the complexion of the Arab-looking figure among the Three Kings who came to worship the newborn Jesus in a Renaissance painting.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:03] Dike | I saw how Steven knew them—one simply through those rather stiff, stubborn, yet smiling eyes; the other simply through her pink cheeks. I thought of the pinkish hue with a coppery tint, which inevitably brought to mind hydrangeas.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:08] Dike | I thought that even these facial features were such that Steven could not fix any one of them on this girl rather than another (this whole was so beautiful and moving, the most different appearances next to each other, various colors coming together, yet like a piece of music, elusive. As the musical phrases passed by, Steven could not separate them, could not recognize each one. As soon as he recognized them, he immediately forgot them. In accordance with the order in which this whole proceeded).\n[1897-07-14 18:10:13] Dike | I saw Steven see a white oval, and then black eyes and green eyes appeared in succession. I thought about whether Steven knew if those girls were the ones who had already exerted their charm on Steven, and Steven couldn't assign what he saw to any particular girl he had distinguished and recognized from the others.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:18] Dike | I saw, through this group of women, a harmonious fluidity spreading out, a continuous transfer of liquid beauty, collective beauty, and dynamic beauty. I thought that in Steven's vision, there were no boundaries (it was only after a while that Steven figured out the differences between them).\n[1897-07-14 18:10:23] Dike | I thought about how each of them had been so carefully chosen, and the fact that these friends had come together in life might not be purely coincidental.",

    "text": "[1897-07-14 18:10:28] The Embankment | I thought that these girls, whose behavior revealed a bold, frivolous, and cruel nature, were extremely sensitive to anything ridiculous or ugly, and could not be attracted by anything noble or intelligent; thus, naturally, they gathered among their own peers.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:33] Dike | I thought of all the girl companions who revealed a contemplative or sensitive nature through their shyness, restraint, awkwardness, and the type of people they probably called \"annoying,\" and how they felt repelled by and ignored them.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:38] The Embankment | I thought of something else—refined, flexible, and graceful, a kind of mixture that would draw them toward other people, with whom they would form friendships. The seductive directness of their nature and the promise of happy times spent with them could only be expressed in this single way.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:43] Dike | I thought about what class they belonged to, and Steven could not accurately determine it. Perhaps this class was at a certain stage of development, or perhaps it was due to wealth and leisure, or to participation in sports (a new custom now common even among certain lower classes), but intellectual education had not yet been added on top of physical exercise.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:48] Dike | I thought of this social class as a sculptural school that had not yet sought out distorted forms, naturally and abundantly producing beautiful bodies, graceful thighs, beautiful buttocks, faces that were holy and serene, expressions that were keen and full of cunning.\n[1897-07-14 18:10:53] Dike | I thought of Steven here, facing the sea, was it not the noble and serene model of human beauty, like those statues exposed to the sun on some Greek coast?\n[1897-07-14 18:10:58] Dike | I saw them, a group of shining comets, moving along the seawall, forward.\n[1897-07-14 18:11:08] Dike | I saw them, but on the surface they seemed not to see the crowd. I thought that even if they believed the crowd around them belonged to another race, their suffering would not awaken any sympathy in their hearts.\n[1897-07-14 18:11:13] Dike | I saw them force the stopped people to make way, as if a machine had suddenly passed through, which one could not expect to avoid pedestrians.\n[1897-07-14 18:11:23] Dike | I saw that they did not acknowledge the existence of an old gentleman, refusing to have anything to do with him. If the gentleman, full of fear or anger, hurried away in a ridiculous and hasty manner, they would only exchange amused glances.\n[1897-07-14 18:11:33] The Embankment | I thought that for those not part of their group, they didn't need to pretend to be disdainful; their inner contempt was sufficient.\n[1897-07-14 18:11:38] Dike | I saw that whenever they encountered an obstacle, they couldn't help but take pleasure in overcoming it, either by rushing through or by standing firm on both feet. Each of them was full of youthful energy, needing to be expressed so intensely that even in times of sorrow or pain, they were more obedient to the demands of their age than to their mood of the day.\n[1897-07-14 18:11:43] The Embankment | I saw them never miss an opportunity to jump or slip, but not intentionally, just as a way to interrupt their slow progress. I thought of scattering beautiful turns in the slow progress, where a sudden inspiration and high skill merged as one, just as Chopin scattered beautiful curves in his most melancholy phrases.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:09] In front of the music pavilion | I saw an old banker, his wife was trying to find a good spot for him, and after hesitating in several places, she finally had him sit on a folding stool by the seawall, where a music pavilion shielded him from the sea wind and the sun.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:19] In front of the music pavilion | I saw my wife, who had noticed he was seated properly, leave him to buy a newspaper, intending to read it to him later to entertain him a bit. I knew that she would just step away for a short while, leaving him alone. This short while never lasted more than five minutes, but to the old man it seemed quite long. The old lady took meticulous care of her husband without showing it. She often left for five minutes so that her husband would feel he could still live like everyone else, and never needed protection.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:29] In front of the music pavilion | I saw the oldest girl in that small group of girls run straight toward the performance platform without hesitation. I saw the musician's platform above his head, forming a natural and enticing springboard.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:39] In front of the music pavilion | I saw her leap over the old man's head, her nimble feet brushing the edge of his naval cap.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:49] In front of the music pavilion | I saw the old man turn ashen with fear. I thought, but the other girls found it really amusing, especially the one with the green eyes and baby face.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:54] In front of the music pavilion | I thought of the admiration and joy in her eyes. Steven seemed to catch a trace of shyness in them, that kind of shyness that is both timid and pretending to be brave, a look that was not found on anyone else's face.\n[1897-07-15 11:29:59] In front of the music pavilion | I heard one of the girls say, \"Poor old fellow, it really makes Steven feel awful, he looks almost dead!\" Her voice was raspy, laced with mockery.\n[1897-07-15 15:24:07] Middle of the road | I saw them take a few more steps forward, then stop briefly in the middle of the road, not caring at all that they were blocking the flow of pedestrians. I saw a group of irregular, complete, strange, and chattering things, like a flock of birds gathered together before taking flight.\n[1897-07-15 15:57:41] Location: Seawall | I saw them continuing to walk along the seawall, which rose above the sea.\n[1897-07-15 15:57:51] Location: Seawall | I thought that now, their lovely faces were no longer vague and confused with one another. Centered around the tallest one, the one who had jumped over the old banker's head, Steven had already distinguished and gathered them together (each one's name was temporarily missing, since Steven didn't know them yet).\n[1897-07-15 15:57:56] Location: Seawall | I saw the small ones emerging from the horizon, with plump, pink cheeks and green eyes; another with brown skin and a straight nose, standing out sharply from the others; and another, her face as white as an egg, her nose forming a small arch like a chick's beak, her face resembling that of someone very young.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:11] Seawall | I saw another one, a big man, wrapped in a cloak. I thought about how the cloak made her look so shabby, so incongruous with her elegant manner, that the explanation that came to people's minds was: this girl's parents were probably quite influential, but their vanity was far less than that of the people bathing in Riverside, and even less than their concern for whether their child's clothes were luxurious. So it made no difference to them what she wore while walking along the seafront; only the bourgeoisie would think the dress looked too poor.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:16] Location: Seawall | I saw her pushing a bicycle, her hips moving as if her bones had all come undone. I saw another girl, her eyes bright and smiling, her cheekbones high, her skin lacking luster, wearing a black polo hat pulled low over her head.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:26] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven pass by her (from her words, Steven heard a harsh \"living off his money\"). I thought about how crude the slang was, how loud their voices were, and Steven abandoned the assumption he had made earlier about the cloak of her companion, instead leaning toward the conclusion that all these girls belonged to the common folk who frequently visited the racetrack, probably the youngest mistresses of the cyclists.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:31] Location: Seawall | I thought, in the end, none of Steven's assumptions considered the possibility that they might be virtuous. Just by looking at them—by the way they smiled at each other, by the unwavering gaze of the girl with dull cheeks—Steven understood that they were not virtuous women.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:36] Location: Seawall | I thought of San, whose grandmother had always been overly cautious and attentive in taking care of Steven, to the point that Steven could not help but believe that there was an inseparable whole to things that were impossible. A young girl who lacked respect for the elderly would never suddenly be stopped by considerations of conscience, when she encountered more tempting pleasures than jumping over the head of an eighty-year-old man.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:41] Location: Seawall | I saw their eyes gleam with satisfaction and camaraderie, occasionally flashing with lively or arrogant indifference, depending on whether they regarded the object as their girlfriend or a passerby. I thought that now, each of them had developed her own personality.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:46] Location: Seawall | I saw that they understood each other very deeply, and were able to walk together for long periods, forming an \"independent column.\" Their eyes exchanged messages, aware of how much they understood each other. I thought of their independent, separate bodies slowly moving forward, and between these bodies, a connection had been introduced.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:51] Location: Seawall | I thought of this connection, though invisible to the eye, was very harmonious, like the same fiery figure, the same atmosphere, making their bodies form a single entity. The various parts of this whole were of the same nature, and the surrounding crowd, in which this line slowly moved, remained indifferent to it.\n[1897-07-15 15:58:56] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven pass by the girl with high cheekbones and a brown complexion who was pushing her bicycle. For a moment, Steven's gaze met her sly, smiling eyes.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:06] Location: Seawall | I thought of that gaze coming from the depths of an inhuman world that enclosed the life of this small tribe, a world that was an unreachable unknown. The idea of what Steven was surely could not reach that world, and would not find a place there.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:11] Location: Seawall | I saw the girl with a sports cap, its brim pulled low over her forehead, completely absorbed in listening to her companions.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:21] Location: Seawall | I thought of the moment when the black gleam in her eyes met Steven's, and whether she had seen Steven. If she had, what did Steven mean to her? Had she recognized which world Steven belonged to?\n[1897-07-15 15:59:26] Location: Seawall | I thought about these questions that Steven could not answer, like using a telescope to see strange creatures on a neighboring planet appearing before the Stevenes. The Stevenes would find it hard to conclude that there were humans there, that the creatures saw them, and what thoughts they might awaken in their minds upon seeing the Stevenes.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:31] Location: Seawall | I thought that if the Stevenes considered this girl's eyes merely bright mica discs, they would not greedily want to know her life and merge her existence with their own. But the Stevenes felt that what shimmered within this reflective sphere was not solely due to its material structure.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:36] Location: Seawall | I thought of the Stevenes, who felt that this was the black shadow cast by the life's perception of the people and places it knew—the grass of the racecourse, the sand of the path—but the Stevenes did not yet understand what this black shadow was.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:41] Location: Seawall | I thought of this little Bertha, who was more alluring to Steven than the Bertha in the Persian paradise. She would ride her bike through fields and woods, possibly taking Steven to those places. The Stevenes felt that her gaze was a projection of the home she was returning to, the plans she was forming, or the arrangements people had already made for her.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:46] Location: Seawall | I thought of the Stevens, who especially felt that this was her herself, with her desires, her likes, her dislikes, her vague, intermittent wishes. Steven knew that if Steven could not possess what was in her gaze, he could certainly not possess this girl on her bicycle.",

    "text": "[1897-07-15 15:59:51] Seawall | I thought that what aroused Steven's desire was her entire life. A painful desire, because Steven felt it was unattainable, yet a fascinating one. Until this moment, Steven's life had suddenly stopped, no longer the whole of Steven's life, but rather just a small part of the space before Steven, a space he was eager to occupy, a space composed of these girls' lives.\n[1897-07-15 15:59:56] Location: Seawall | I thought that it was this desire which gave Steven this self, this extension of Steven, this expansion of Steven—that was happiness. There was undoubtedly no common habit or common thought among the Stevenes, making it all the more difficult for Steven to make friends with them and win their favor.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:01] Sea Wall | I thought, but perhaps precisely because of this difference, because Steven was aware that any element or factor he had experienced or possessed would never enter the nature of these girls, it was only now that Steven's heart had just replaced contentment with a longing for some kind of life—a longing as thirsty as a dry earth—up until now, Steven's soul had never received even a single drop of such nectar, and it would now greedily drink it in great gulps.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:06] Location: Seawall | I saw the girl with the bright eyes who was cycling, and she seemed to have noticed Steven staring at her intently, so she said something to the tallest girl.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:16] Location: Seawall | I saw what was said, but Steven didn't hear it; only the tall girl laughed.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:26] Location: Seawall | I thought to myself, honestly, that this girl with brown skin was not, precisely, the most to Steven's liking, precisely because of her brown skin. From the day he had seen Michael on the steep little hill at Sunrise, a girl with reddish-brown hair and golden skin had remained an unattainable ideal in Steven's mind.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:31] Location: Seawall | I thought, but take Michael herself, isn't Steven's love for her mainly because of the aura of Christopher's girlfriend, and because she went to visit the cathedral with Christopher?\n[1897-07-15 16:00:36] Location: Seawall | I thought the same thing, and I saw this girl with brown skin looking at Steven (which initially made Steven hopeful, thinking that may be he would have an easier time with her), but Steven wasn't happy about it, because she would introduce Steven to that merciless girl who jumped over the old man's head, to that cruel girl who said \"Poor old fellow, it really makes Steven feel bad,\" and then gradually introduce Steven to each of the girls, since she had such authority and was their inseparable friend.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:41] Location: Seawall | I thought of Steven making a hypothesis: one day, Steven would become the boyfriend of one of these girls. The unfamiliar gaze in their eyes left a deep impression on Steven. They themselves were unaware that, at times, they could have the effect of sunlight shining on a wall.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:46] Seawall | I thought that through the miraculous alchemy, these eyes might allow the idea that \"Steven exists\" and some of my personal friendships with Steven to penetrate their incomprehensible depth. One day, Steven himself might also join them, taking his place in their theories as they walked along the shore.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:51] Location: Seawall | I thought that Steven must have realized the hypothesis itself contained an insoluble contradiction, just as one might stand before a theater from the time of Aeschylus or gaze at a painting depicting a religious procession, and yet still believe that Steven, the spectator, could also be beloved by the gods and occupy a place among the divine in the marching line.\n[1897-07-15 16:00:56] Seawall | I wondered whether the happiness of getting to know these girls was really unattainable. Naturally, among the things Steven had given up, this was probably not the first. Just recalling how many young women had vanished in Riverside, how they had sped away in carriages and thus been forever lost to Steven, was enough.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:01] Location: Seawall | I thought of this small group of girls, so exalted in Steven's eyes, as if they were composed of virgins from Greek mythology. Even the pleasure they brought to Steven had something of the quality of passersby who quickly hurry away. People unknown to Steven, those who forced Steven to set out from his usual life, had a fleeting nature.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:06] Location: Seawall | I thought about how this transience placed Stevenes in a state of pursuit, with nothing left to hinder their imagination. Yet in everyday life, the women with whom Stevenes frequently associated would eventually reveal their flaws. To strip away the veil of imagination from Steven's happiness was to reduce it to its bare essence, leaving nothing but emptiness.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:11] Location: Seawall | I thought of what you've already seen—that Steven does not look down on the matchmakers. But if these girls were to go to the matchmakers themselves, they would lose the very element of richness and unpredictability that makes them so fascinating to Steven.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:16] Seawall | I thought about how the uncertainty of whether one could attain the object of desire was capable of arousing imagination. One had to let imagination create a purpose, a purpose that concealed another; one had to let imagination replace the idea of entering someone's life with the pleasure of the senses, preventing Stevenes from distinguishing between this pleasure, preventing them from tasting its true flavor, and keeping it confined within its own limits.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:21] Location: Seawall | I thought of those afternoons spent fishing, when between Steven and the fish there had to be a surging current to separate them. The smooth flesh, indistinct in shape, glided about in the sky-blue, transparent, and moving fluid, right beside the Stevenes, who didn't really know what to do with it. If the Stevenes had first seen the fish served on a plate, they would not have gone to such great lengths and taken such roundabout methods to catch it.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:26] Location: Seawall | I thought about how, here, the proportion of social standing changed, which was a characteristic of seaside life. These girls also benefited from this. All the advantages that could extend and magnify Steven in the social class he was used to were now invisible, and in fact, had been canceled.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:31] Location: Seawall | I thought about the reverse: those people whom others probably didn't think had these advantages ended up being made to seem great by an artificial category, striding forward with confidence. This artificial category was more comforting than an unfamiliar girl. That day, these girls seemed so remarkable in Steven's eyes, yet they could never possibly understand what was remarkable about Steven.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:36] Location: Seawall | I thought that for this small group of girls, strolling along the seashore was merely a fleeting moment among the countless female guests passing by, and such fleeting moments always unsettled Steven. Here, however, this fleetingness returned to a slow motion, almost approaching stillness. More accurately, in one of these slow phases, faces were no longer carried away by a whirlwind, but remained calm and clear, and Steven found them even more beautiful.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:41] Location: Sea Wall | I thought, but just as when the carriage from Charles whisked Steven away, it didn't prevent Steven from thinking that if Steven had stopped for a moment to look closely, certain details—the skin with blemishes, a problem on the nostrils, an ordinary gaze, a grimace when smiling, an unattractive figure—would have replaced the details Steven had surely imagined out of thin air on the girl's face and figure.",

    "text": "[1897-07-15 16:01:46] Location: Seawall | I thought that as long as the figure had beautiful curves, and from afar looked healthy and rosy-faced, Steven would kindly add to it a shoulder that was either already stored in his heart or carefully thought of beforehand, a sweet glance. Such quick guesses about someone you've only caught a fleeting glimpse of might lead Steven and others to make mistakes, just like when we read too fast, catching only one syllable and not yet having time to see the rest, and then we automatically insert a character into our minds based on what we already know, even though that's not actually what's written in the book.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:51] Seawall | I thought that it was no longer possible for me to be in such a situation. Steven had already examined their faces carefully. For each person, Steven did not look at them from various sides, nor even very often from the front, but he could still, based on a couple of different features, either revise or confirm or \"prove\" the various assumptions he had made at first glance about their lines and skin tones. He could see that, behind a series of expressions, there remained some sort of permanent, material substance on their faces.\n[1897-07-15 16:01:56] Seawall | I thought that, therefore, Steven could confidently imagine that neither in Willowbrook nor in Riverside, not even among the lovely women who stopped Steven's steps and caught his eye, had there ever been women like these this year--women Steven didn't know at all, yet whose appearance and disappearance left Steven with such a sense of melancholy that he found the idea of befriending them utterly enchanting.\n[1897-07-15 16:02:01] Location: Seawall | I thought that never in actresses, village girls, or boarding school girls had Steven seen such beauty, so full of the unknown and unimagined, so immeasurably precious, and yet so incredibly unattainable.\n[1897-07-15 16:02:06] Location: Seawall | I thought about how, in terms of the happiness that had not yet been tasted but was still possible, they were such delicious samples, in such excellent condition that Steven, for almost entirely rational reasons, felt discouraged, afraid that he would not be able to experience the most mysterious thing that beautiful women could offer. Steven would only experience it under absolutely unique conditions, ensuring he would not be deceived.\n[1897-07-15 16:02:11] Location: Seawall | I thought of them as the beautiful women people have always longed for, the ones one can console oneself with without ever possessing, and who one does not demand happiness from if one has no desire for them—just as Matthew had once refused to do before he fell in love with John—resulting in a lifetime spent never knowing what that other kind of pleasure was like.\n[1897-07-15 16:02:16] Location: Seawall | I thought that perhaps the happiness I had never experienced actually didn't exist, and when it finally came, its mystery would vanish, revealing itself as nothing more than a projection of desire, a mirage. If that were the case, Steven could only blame the merciless laws of nature. If these natural laws applied to these girls, they should apply to all girls, not just to imperfect ones.\n[1897-07-15 16:02:21] Location: Seawall | I thought about how they had been chosen by Steven among all possible candidates, and how Steven, with the satisfaction of a botanist, clearly realized that it was impossible to find such a rare and complete collection of girls anywhere else.\n[1897-07-16 19:22:24] Location: Seawall | I saw that, at this moment, Steven saw them stop their delicate, fence-like line right before him. This fence was like a cluster of Pennsylvania roses, an ornament of a garden on the cliff.\n[1897-07-16 19:22:39] Sea Wall | I saw the entire ocean route on which a ship was passing, and this ship moved so slowly across the blue surface, as if from one stalk to another.\n[1897-07-16 19:22:54] Location: Seawall | I saw a lazy butterfly lingering deep within the flower's crown, but the ship had long since passed the butterfly. Yet the butterfly seemed confident that it would reach the destination before the ship, which was now sailing toward the flower. I thought the butterfly might have to wait until a patch of blue appeared between the prow of the ship and the first petal of the rose before it would take off!\n[1897-07-16 19:22:59] Hotel | I saw Steven go back to his room, because Steven was having dinner with Peter in Springfield.\n[1897-07-17 00:43:07] Hotel | I knew that David had asked Steven to lie in bed for an hour before leaving on his trips in the evenings these past few days, as recommended by the doctor from Riverside. Soon, he extended this nap to every evening.\n[1897-07-17 00:43:27] Hotel | I knew that to go back, it wasn't necessary to leave the embankment, nor to go through the hall, that is, to enter the hotel from the back. In Sunrise, lunch was served an hour earlier every Saturday.\n[1897-07-17 00:43:42] Hotel | I see that it is now summer, with such long days. I knew that even at the Grand Hôtel de Riverside, according to similar prior rules, when they set the table for dinner, the sun was still high in the sky, it seemed more like the time for afternoon tea.\n[1897-07-17 00:43:52] Hotel | I saw Steven step through the flimsy wooden window frame and enter the dining room, then he immediately left the dining room to take the elevator. I saw the large glazed door with wheels still open, level with the seawall.\n[1897-07-17 00:43:57] The Grand Hotel Balbec | When I saw Steven smile at the manager as he passed by the office, he returned the smile in a way that was not at all unpleasant. I thought that since Steven had come to Riverside, his generous concern had gradually, like a natural lesson, infused a smile into his face, transforming his features.\n[1897-07-17 00:44:02] The Balbec Hotel | I thought how Steven's face had become familiar to Steven, showing some rather general significance, yet readable like a person's handwriting, utterly unlike the incomprehensible, unbearable block letters that his face had first revealed to Steven.\n[1897-07-17 00:44:07] Balbec Hotel | I thought of Steven, of the person who had appeared before him on that day, now forgotten, or if Steven could still recall him, he would no longer recognize him in comparison to the unimportant, refined, repulsive, and somewhat caricatured figure he had become.\n[1897-07-17 00:44:12] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven ring the elevator button. I thought of Steven's shyness and melancholy on the first evening he arrived in Riverside, which had now disappeared.\n[1897-07-17 02:05:11] Elevator | I saw Steven, feeling as if he were rising upward along the thorax of a vertebrate, beside the elevator operator.\n[1897-07-17 02:05:21] Elevator | I saw that now, he was no longer silent, but was talking incessantly to Steven. I heard, \"There are fewer people than a month ago, they're starting to leave, it's getting cold.\"\n[1897-07-17 02:05:26] Elevator | I thought that Steven said this not because it was actually true, but because he had found another job in a hotter seaside climate, and he wanted all the Stevenes to leave quickly so the hotel could close, giving him a few days to himself before he \"returned\" to his new position.\n[1897-07-17 02:05:31] Elevator | I thought about how Steven believed the words \"return\" and \"new\" were not contradictory, because for someone who operates an elevator, \"return\" is the conventional form of the verb \"enter.\"\n[1897-07-17 02:05:36] Elevator | I knew he belonged to the modern proletariat who wished to erase all traces of the wage system from language. I thought the only thing that could astonish Steven was that he condescended to use the word \"position.\"\n[1897-07-17 02:05:41] Elevator | I heard him tell Steven that, on his \"return\" to his \"post,\" he would have a more beautiful \"uniform\" and better \"benefits.\" I thought of Steven, who had already found the words \"uniform\" and \"salary\" old-fashioned and unsuitable.\n[1897-07-17 02:05:46] Elevator | I thought about how, for some incomprehensible contradiction, the words in \"Boss'\" mouth persisted unrelentingly, lasting longer than the concept of inequality, so the elevator operator's words to Steven were always incomprehensible to Steven.\n[1897-07-17 02:05:51] Elevator | I heard the elevator operator speak before Steven could ask, \"That lady just left from where you live.\" I thought the only thing Steven cared about was finding out whether David was at the hotel.\n[1897-07-17 02:05:56] Elevator | I thought Steven had been taken again, thinking that it was Steven's grandmother who had gone out.\n[1897-07-17 02:06:01] Elevator | I heard, \"No, Steven thinks that lady is one of your family's servants.\" I thought that the old bourgeois language should indeed be abolished, but since in that old bourgeois language, a cook was not called an \"employee,\" Steven considered it for a while.\n[1897-07-17 02:06:06] Elevator | I heard, \"He made a mistake. The Stevenes don't own the factory and don't have any employees.\"\n[1897-07-17 02:06:11] Elevator | I suddenly thought of Steven, who had just remembered that the word \"servant\" gave the household staff a sense of pride, just like the waiters in the café having mustaches. The lady who had just left must have been Françoise.\n[1897-07-17 02:06:16] Elevator | I thought that Steven must have guessed that Françoise was probably visiting the bartender at the hotel or watching the Belgian lady's maid doing her embroidery.\n[1897-07-17 02:06:21] Elevator | I thought that Steven believed it wasn't enough for the elevator operator to satisfy his own sense of pride, because when he pitied his own class, he spoke of \"the worker's home\" or \"the common man's home,\" using the singular, just like Racine spoke of \"the poor.\"\n[1897-07-17 02:06:26] Corridor of the hotel | I saw that Steven no longer spoke to the elevator operator as he usually did, and now, as he went up and down through the hotel in this brief passage, he got no reply from Steven. I thought of the enthusiasm and shyness Steven had shown on his first day, which had long since disappeared.\n[1897-07-17 09:55:11] Corridor of the hotel | I saw the hotel, which looked like a toy, hollow in the center, unfolding layer by layer around the Stevenes, like branching corridors.\n[1897-07-17 09:55:26] Corridor of the hotel | I saw Steven seeing the dim, fading light deep in the corridor, growing weaker and weaker, with the doors of the passage or the steps of the inner staircase becoming tiny, all turned into golden amber by the light, soft and mysterious like the evening.\n[1897-07-17 09:55:41] Corridor of the hotel | I saw a shaft of golden light on each floor, shining on the carpet, revealing the remnants of the sunset and the windows of the drawing room. I thought of Steven imagining, in the dusk, how Rembrandt could sketch a window frame or a well's pulley with a single stroke.\n[1897-07-17 09:55:46] Corridor of the hotel | I thought to myself, was the girl Steven had just seen from Riverside, and who might they be?\n[1897-07-17 09:55:51] Corridor of the hotel | When I thought of Steven feeling desire directed toward a small group he had chosen, every person connected in any way to this tiny tri be became a source of emotion, and then a source of dreams.",

    "text": "[1897-07-17 13:16:29] Seawall (Memories) | I knew that Steven had once heard a lady on the promenade say, \"She was a girlfriend of little Célimène.\"\n[1897-07-17 13:50:03] Corridor of the hotel | I thought of Steven's confident expression, which was like someone explaining, \"He is the inseparable companion of young La Roche-Foucauld.\"\n[1897-07-17 13:50:08] Corridor of the hotel | I thought at once that from the face of the person who had heard the news, you could feel a strong desire, a longing to take another good look at the person who was so beloved, the one who was known as \"the girlfriend of little Cimino.\"\n[1897-07-17 13:50:13] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that Steven surely considered this a privilege, one probably not granted to just anyone.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:18] Corridor of the hotel | I thought about how Steven believed that the aristocracy was relative, that there were small, lowly cracks where a shopkeeper's son could become a refined prince and rule a court like a young Prince of Wales.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:23] Corridor of the hotel | I thought about how, since then, Steven often tried desperately to recall how the name \"Simeon\" had affected him on the beach, when Steven had not yet been able to discern its form, had no confidence in the name, and was uncertain whether it referred to this person or that one.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:28] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that Steven found this name full of exciting, vague, and fresh feelings for the story that followed Steven, each letter, every second, etched more deeply into Steven's heart because of the constant attention it received.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:33] Corridor of the hotel | I thought of this name becoming the first word that returned to Steven's mind (or upon waking up, or after fainting), even before concepts like \"What time is it?\" or \"Where is Steven?\" even before the word \"Steven\" itself.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:38] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that Steven seemed to believe that the person it referred to was Steven himself, more than even Steven himself, and that after the moment of losing consciousness, the silence that came before all other silences was the process in which this very word had not yet been thought of.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:43] Corridor of the hotel | I thought, for no reason at all, ever since the first day, Steven had wondered, perhaps the name Simone was the name of one of these girls.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:48] Corridor of the hotel | I thought about Steven constantly pondering how to get acquainted with the Cottard family, of course through someone he considered of higher status than himself.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:53] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that if these people were just common street girls, it would probably not be hard to make her not develop a contemptuous view of Steven.\n[1897-07-17 13:50:58] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that Steven believed there could be no perfect old friends, and that as long as one had not overcome this disdain, one could never fully enter the heart of someone who looked down on you.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:03] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that Steven's mind would only find peace once Steven and his kind had transformed these outsiders into something similar to themselves.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:08] Corridor of the hotel | I thought that in this regard, the minds of the Stevenes reacted and functioned in the same way as their bodies; their bodies could not tolerate the intrusion of something foreign, unless they immediately digested or assimilated the intruder.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:13] Corridor of the hotel | I saw her turn her head and look around only two or three times, as if she had become aware of Steven's fixed gaze. I thought Steven must have supposed that little Simone was the most beautiful of all the girls—Steven seemed to think she could have become his mistress.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:18] Corridor of the hotel | I saw Steven asking the elevator operator if he knew anyone in Riverside with the surname Simeon. I realized that this person disliked being told he knew nothing about something, so I replied that he seemed to have heard of the name before.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:23] Corridor of the hotel | I had reached the last floor when Steven asked him to have the latest list of outsiders sent to Steven.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:33] Corridor of the hotel | I saw Steven come out of the elevator, but instead of heading to his own room, he kept walking straight down the corridor.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:43] Corridor of the hotel | I saw that, although the servant in charge of this floor was afraid of the draft, he had already opened the window at the end of the corridor. I knew this window did not face the sea, but the hills and the valley.\n[1897-07-17 13:51:58] Corridor of the hotel | I know that people never really see the outside view, because the window glass is opaque and is often closed.\n[1897-07-17 13:52:18] Corridor of the hotel | I saw Steven pause briefly by the window, just long enough to pay homage to this \"scene.\"\n[1897-07-17 13:52:28] Hotel corridor | I saw this time, and it allowed me to look farther than the hills.\n[1897-07-17 13:52:43] Corridor of the hotel | I saw Steven seeing the hotel backed against this small hill, on which there was only a single house visible in the distance.\n[1897-07-17 13:52:58] Corridor of the hotel | I saw it, but the distant view, along with the sunset's glow, retained its size while being adorned with delicate carvings and a velvet-like jewelry box, just as one would decorate a miniature architectural model.\n[1897-07-17 13:53:13] Corridor of the hotel | I thought of Steven as a sacred object, like a small golden or enameled temple or chapel that was only brought out on rare occasions for the faithful to venerate.\n[1897-07-18 01:42:47] Corridor of the hotel | I saw the servant holding a large bunch of keys in one hand and touching his clerical round cap to Steven, greeting him, but since the evening air was fresh and cool, he didn't take off his hat. I thought, but the moment of adoration had already lasted too long.\n[1897-07-18 01:42:52] Corridor of the hotel | I saw him coming back and closing the two window shutters again. I thought of Steven, who felt as though he were closing the two panels of a reliquary containing a saint's relics, thus concealing the small temple and the golden sacred object from Steven's worship.\n[1897-07-18 04:56:19] Bedroom | I saw Steven enter his own bedroom. I saw that as the seasons advanced, the view from the window also changed.\n[1897-07-18 04:56:29] Bedroom | I saw that the room was first very bright, only on overcast days did it become dim.\n[1897-07-18 04:56:44] Bedroom | I saw that at this moment, within the sea-blue glass, framed by the iron bars of Steven's window, the sea was set like a stained-glass window in a church, its circular waves making the glass seem endless.\n[1897-07-18 04:56:59] Bedroom | I saw that along the entire rocky, deeply indented edge of the bay, the sea scattered some triangles, each adorned with delicate brushstrokes depicting motionless spumes. I thought how Steven would have described it as a feather from Pisanello's work—snow-white, ever-persistent, creamy enameled, fixed in that triangular shape, representing a layer of snow among the glassware of Calais.\n[1897-07-18 04:57:04] Bedroom | I saw that soon, the days grew shorter. When Steven returned to the room, the sky was a pale purple, as if stamped by the stiff, geometric, fleeting, dazzling face of the sun.\n[1897-07-19 15:26:12] Bedroom | I saw the sun as if it were a magical symbol, a mysterious specter, bending down along the chain of the horizon toward the sea, like a religious painting above the altar.\n[1897-07-21 00:15:23] Bedroom | I saw the various parts of the sunset reflected on the glass of the low mahogany bookcases lined along the wall. I thought that in Steven's mind, it had already become associated with the famous painting from which it had originated.\n[1897-07-21 00:15:28] Bedroom | I thought that perhaps it was a series of scenes painted by some master of the past for a religious order, framed together. Later, in the museum's hall, they had displayed each piece separately, and the viewers had to use their imagination to place them back in their original position on the altarpiece's rear panel.\n[1897-07-21 00:15:33] Bedroom | A few weeks later, when Steven came upstairs, the sun had already set, and the sky above the sea was a red ribbon. It reminded me of what Steven had seen on the hill of Golgotha when he returned from his walk in Sunrise and was about to go down to the kitchen for dinner.",

The sight of a ship sailing away like a night traveler also gave Steven the same impression.\n[1897-07-23 10:45:59] Bedroom | I thought, but in the room where Steven himself was at that moment, Steven did not feel confined, because in an hour, Steven was going to leave this place and go out in a carriage.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:04] Bedroom | I saw Steven throw himself onto the bed. I saw a ship that was quite close to Steven, and I could see it from where Steven was.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:14] Bedroom | I found it strange that ships could be seen moving through the darkness at night, like dark-colored swans that were silent, motionless, and yet not asleep.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:29] Bedroom | I thought that Steven seemed to feel as though he were lying in a cabin on a ship, with the picture of the sea surrounding him from all sides.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:34] Bedroom | I saw, but it was indeed often just some drawings. I thought of Steven, who had forgotten that beneath the colors of the drawing, the beach was forming a desolate, pitiful expanse, and that the restless sea wind of night was sweeping across the entire beach.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:39] Bedroom | I knew that when we first arrived in Riverside, the night wind came, and Steven was so restless and uneasy. I thought that even now, in Steven's room, Steven's entire attention was still on the few girls who had passed by him, and Steven's emotions could no longer be calm, could no longer remain indifferent.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:44] Bedroom | I thought that in Steven's mind, the truly beautiful impressions would never arise, and the prospect of the Springfield dinner only made Steven more restless.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:49] Bedroom | I thought that at such moments, Steven's mind remained on the surface of his body, and Steven was about to dress this body in order to appear as attractive as possible before the scrutinizing eyes of the women in that dazzling hotel.\n[1897-07-23 10:46:54] Bedroom | I thought of Steven, who was unable to inject profound thoughts behind the colors of things.\n[1897-07-24 12:27:10] Bedroom | I saw the swifts and swallows tirelessly fluttering lightly beneath Steven's window, like a fountain, like the flame of life, blending the high, intermittent bursts with the unchanging white line of their long, horizontal trajectory.\n[1897-07-25 14:07:51] Bedroom | I thought that Steven felt this regional natural phenomenon connected the scenery that emerged before his eyes to reality.\n[1897-07-25 14:07:56] Bedroom | I thought that without this fascinating miracle, Steven might have considered the scene before him nothing more than a daily changing gallery of paintings, which people subjectively projected onto the place where Steven was, even though the paintings had no necessary connection to that location.\n[1897-07-25 14:08:01] Bedroom | I saw a yellow cloud next to the meticulously carved red sun, which was round as the moon, like a lake. I recalled once when Steven thought that was the exhibition of Japanese woodblock and copperplate prints.\n[1897-07-25 14:08:06] Bedroom | I saw by the lake, a black dagger-like shape, like the silhouette of the trees along the shore, and a faint pinkish hue.\n[1897-07-25 14:08:21] Bedroom | I saw the color bloom, like a river, and along its banks, it seemed there were boats stranded on the sand, waiting for people to pull them into the water. I knew that since Steven had gotten his first crayon box, he had never seen such a rosy hue.\n[1897-07-25 14:08:36] Bedroom | I thought of Steven's disdainful, bored, and frivolous glance, like that of an amateur or a woman who drops by a gallery between social visits, and muttered to myself: \"It's strange, this sunset, unique in some way, but Steven has already seen just as beautiful and astonishing sunsets.\"\n[1897-07-25 14:08:41] Bedroom | I saw at night as a boat was swallowed by the horizon, transforming it into a fluid, blending completely with the horizon's color, like an Impressionist painting.\n[1897-07-27 01:36:01] Bedroom | I saw the ships as if they were made of the same material as the horizon, as if people were merely sketching the hulls and ropes in the blue sky through the mist.\n[1897-07-27 01:36:16] Bedroom | I saw the ropes crossing each other, making the ship's body even smaller, turning it into a piece of gold and silverware.\n[1897-07-28 05:43:53] Bedroom | I sometimes saw the ocean filling almost the entire window of Steven, above which was a strip of sky, just a line, as blue as the sea. I thought that Steven believed it was still the sea, and only under the play of light did it show different colors.\n[1897-07-28 05:43:58] Bedroom | I saw another day when the sea was only depicted at the bottom of the window, while the rest of the window was filled with drifting clouds.\n[1897-07-29 09:51:45] Bedroom | I saw, one after another, clouds pushing and shoving Steven in the horizontal direction. I thought the result seemed to be the deliberate or skilled work of an artist, and the window glass was introducing \"The Study of Clouds.\"\n[1897-07-29 09:51:50] Bedroom | I saw that, at the same time, the various panes of the bookcase showed similar clouds, but these were clouds on another part of the horizon, and they were colored differently by the light. I thought of offering you the same subject repeatedly.\n[1897-07-30 13:59:32] Bedroom | I know this is a repetition that certain contemporary painters greatly cherish, always taken from different moments. I thought that now, thanks to the fixed nature of art, it could be laid out in a single room, in the form of a pastel painting, and pressed under a sheet of glass.\n[1897-07-30 13:59:37] Bedroom | I sometimes saw, on the uniform gray of sea and sky, a delicate, intricate touch of pink.\n[1897-07-30 13:59:52] Bedroom | I saw at that moment a small butterfly sleeping below the window, like it had settled its wings beneath this Whistler-esque painting titled \"Harmony in Grey and Pink.\"\n[1897-07-30 14:00:07] Bedroom | I saw the pink gradually fade, and there was nothing left to look at. I knew this was a work signed by Master Chelsea.\n[1897-07-30 14:00:22] Bedroom | I saw Steven stand there in a daze for a moment, then draw the curtains and lie down again.\n[1897-07-30 14:00:32] Bedroom | I saw from the bed, Steven saw a sliver of light still remaining above the curtain. I saw that streak of light gradually grow dimmer, getting finer and finer.\n[1897-07-30 14:00:42] Bedroom | I knew that at this usual time, Steven was already sitting at the table. I thought that today, Steven let this moment pass away above the curtain, neither sad nor regretful.\n[1897-07-30 14:00:47] Bedroom | I thought that because Steven knew, today was different from other days, like the brief interruption of night in the endless daylight of the polar day, today felt longer than usual.\n[1897-07-30 14:00:52] Bedroom | I thought that Steven knew, from this evening's chrysalis, the dazzling light of the Springfield Hotel was about to undergo a beautiful transformation and emerge fully formed.\n[1897-07-30 14:00:57] Bedroom | I saw Steven stretch in bed, get up, and finish getting ready. I heard Steven talking to himself: \"It's time.\"\n[1897-07-30 14:01:02] Bedroom | I thought of such useless time, freed from the burdens of material life, and Steven found it charming.\n[1897-07-30 15:00:00] Bedroom | I saw Steven here, and all the energy I had accumulated from wasting the afternoon was now spent on drying Steven's body after his bath, dressing him in a tailless formal suit, and tying a necktie. I know that others are having dinner downstairs.\n[1897-07-30 20:42:52] Bedroom | I thought of the movements guided by the joy of a long-awaited reunion with a woman.\n[1897-07-30 20:42:57] Bedroom | I knew that this was the woman whom Steven had noticed once before at Springfield, and she seemed to have been looking at Steven for a long time. I thought that for a moment she had left her seat, perhaps hoping that Steven would follow.\n[1897-07-30 20:43:02] Bedroom | I thought of Steven, who, with a happy heart, added all these bait to himself in order to fully and completely immerse himself in a new life.\n[1897-07-30 20:43:07] Bedroom | I thought of it as a life of freedom and carefree happiness. Steven wanted Peter's calm to support Steven's indecisiveness, and to make a choice among the various species of living things and the products from all over the world.\n[1897-07-30 20:43:12] Bedroom | I thought of these dishes, which were a bit of a treat for Steven, and they would greatly stimulate Steven's appetite or his imagination.\n[1897-07-30 20:43:17] Bedroom/Corridor | I saw it come to an end at last, the days when Steven could no longer return to his room from the seaside through the dining hall.",

    "text": "[1897-07-30 20:43:32] Outside the hotel | I saw that the restaurant's glass windows were no longer open, because night had already fallen outside, and this glass hive was brightly lit, drawing in the poor and the curious.\n[1897-07-30 20:43:47] Outside the hotel | I saw they could not enter into that brightly lit space, and so they clung to the shining, smooth walls of the glass hive like a dark, swarming mass of bees carried by the autumn wind.\n[1897-07-30 20:43:57] Bedroom | I saw someone knocking on the door, and it was Hemme who brought Steven the latest list of outsiders.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:02] Bedroom | I saw Hemme before he left, and he insisted on telling Steven. I heard that Unknown_Dreyfus deserved to die.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:07] Bedroom | \"I'll be told everything,\" he said to Steven, \"not this year, but next. It was a man very closely connected with the staff who said that to Steven.\"\n[1897-07-30 20:44:17] Bedroom | I saw Steven ask him whether, before the end of the year, people would still be unable to make up their minds to reveal everything immediately.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:22] Bedroom | I saw Hemme imitating the man's gestures, shaking his head and giving a thumbs-up as his customers did, the meaning being: \"Don't ask for too much.\" I heard \"He dropped his cigarette.\" Emile continued speaking.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:27] Bedroom | \"I'm not going this year, Émeri,\" he said, tapping Steven on the shoulder, \"it's not possible this year. By Easter, maybe.\"\n[1897-07-30 20:44:32] Bedroom | I saw it, then Hémé gently patted Steven's shoulder. I heard someone say to Steven: \"You see, this is what he said, Steven has told you exactly.\"\n[1897-07-30 20:44:37] Bedroom | I thought about it: either the great man treated him so casually that he was thoroughly pleased with himself, or Steven could more clearly see the value of the argument and the reason for the hopes of people like Steven.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:42] Bedroom | I saw Steven on the first page of the list of outsiders, and when I read the words \"Simone and her family,\" my heart gave a sudden jolt. I thought of Steven, whose heart still harbored the long-standing dream that had existed since childhood.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:47] Bedroom | I thought of how all the tenderness in my heart, the feelings I had, would merge into one, brought to Steven by someone as different from Steven as possible.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:52] Bedroom | I thought of her, now called Simone by Steven, and I recalled the youthful, vigorous body I had seen on the seawall.\n[1897-07-30 20:44:57] Bedroom | I thought how harmonious it was that Steven saw them arranged in a sports formation as magnificent as the masterpieces of ancient times and Giotto.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:02] Bedroom | I thought of Steven, who used this name and the beautiful, harmonious memory to create the Steven who was waiting.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:07] Bedroom | I thought that Steven didn't know which of these girls was Mademoiselle Ximenes, nor whether any of them actually bore that name.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:12] Bedroom | I thought, but Steven knew that Madame Simons loved Steven, and Steven had to rely on Peter to immediately make her acquaintance.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:32] Bedroom | I knew it was a pity that, under these conditions, Peter was only allowed to extend his vacation, and he had to return every day to East-Ingelheim.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:37] Bedroom | I thought that, in order to prevent him from fulfilling his military duty, Steven had originally believed he could count not only on his friendship for Steven, but also on the curiosity of a human naturalist.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:42] Bedroom | I thought of Steven, who often had this kind of curiosity. Sometimes Steven had never even seen the person people were talking about, but as soon as he heard that there was a beautiful cashier in some fruit shop, he would want to make acquaintance with this new variety of female beauty.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:47] Bedroom | I thought of Steven wanting to talk about his young girls in front of Peter, and how that would also stir up the same curiosity in him.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:52] Bedroom | I knew he was the actor's lover, and he loved her. I thought, who knew that Steven was completely wrong, this curiosity had long since become numb.\n[1897-07-30 20:45:57] Bedroom | I thought that even if he felt something, he would suppress it, because he was superstitious and believed that whether his mistress was faithful to him depended on whether he himself was faithful.\n[1897-07-30 20:46:02] Bedroom | When I saw all the Stevenes setting off for the Springfield dinner party, he didn't positively agree to take care of those girls.\n[1897-07-31 01:05:02] Rivebelle Hotel | At first, when the Stevenes arrived at Springfield, the sun had just set, but the sky was still very bright.\n[1897-07-31 01:05:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the hotel garden, where the lights had not yet been lit. The heat of the day was descending, as if stored at the bottom of a vase, and along the sides of the vase, the air formed a transparent, dark, and thick jelly.\n[1897-07-31 01:05:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw a large cluster of roses clinging to the wall, drawing pink streaks on the fading wall, like the branch-like patterns one sees in a piece of onyx.\n[1897-07-31 01:05:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw them getting down from the carriage not long after. I saw that night had already fallen.\n[1897-07-31 01:05:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that either the bad weather or the desire to have a moment of quiet had caused the driver to be called later than usual. In any case, when the Stevenes set out from Riverside, night had already fallen.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven listening to the sea wind. I thought of those days, but Steven wasn't sad. Steven knew this didn't mean giving up his plans, nor did it mean being locked away in a room.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, knowing that the Stevenes would enter the hotel lobby to the sound of the Cossack music, where countless lights would effortlessly conquer the darkness and cold with their bright, golden iron.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven happily getting into the carriage, sitting next to Peter. I saw the carriage waiting in the downpour for the Stevenes.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that now, every time Steven sat down at the table to begin a critical study or to read a novel, he felt bored.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that Christopher said, he was convinced that Steven was especially capable of appreciating the pleasures of intellectual labor. I thought that although Steven himself did not hold this view.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that in recent days, Christopher's words had made Steven feel that this boredom revealed a glimmer of hope regarding what Steven would do in the future.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought to myself, \"After all, perhaps whether or not one experiences pleasure while writing a novel is not an unassailable criterion for judging whether a piece of writing is beautiful or valuable.\"\n[1897-07-31 01:06:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought to myself, \"Perhaps this is just a secondary state that often comes along with it, and the absence of this pleasure does not necessarily mean the writing is not beautiful. Perhaps some masterpieces were written with a yawn.\"\n[1897-07-31 01:06:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that David told Steven that if Steven was in good health, he would write well and would do so with a happy heart. I thought of this and it dispelled Steven's doubts.\n[1897-07-31 01:06:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I know, but the family doctor of Steven's family thought it was more prudent to warn Steven that his health condition might put him in danger, and he listed various health precautions that Steven should follow to prevent any accidents.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, who believed that all pleasures should be subordinated to a goal, a goal that was infinitely more important than pleasure itself: the goal of becoming strong and powerful enough to accomplish the great work that might lie within Steven himself.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that ever since arriving at Riverside, Steven has been exercising a careful and frequent control over himself. I thought that drinking a cup of coffee would keep Steven awake all night, and sleep was essential for him to feel rested the next day, so no one could possibly get Steven to touch that coffee.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought, but once we arrived at Springfield, under the influence of new pleasures, Steven was in another state of mind again; it was only exceptional circumstances that could bring Steven into such a state.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, whose patient web, woven over so many days and meant to guide the Stevenes toward wisdom, had now been broken, as if there would be no more tomorrows, no more lofty goals to achieve.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that, in an instant, the entire meticulous and careful health maintenance system, which had been working to uphold this noble goal, would vanish into thin air.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw a footman ask Steven if he wanted a coat. I heard Peter always saying to Steven, \"Are you cold? You'd better put it on, the weather isn't very warm.\"\n[1897-07-31 01:07:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard Steven always answer, \"No, no.\" I thought that perhaps at that time Steven wasn't feeling cold, but in any case, Steven no longer knew what it meant to fear falling ill, to fear dying, or to consider writing important.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven hand over his coat.\n[1897-07-31 01:07:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the Stevenes entering the hotel lobby to the military music played by the Gypsies, moving forward between the rows of tables already set with food, like advancing along a path where honor was easily obtained.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the military honors bestowed on Steven and his companions, and the triumphant march they did not deserve, which filled them with the exuberant joy of the music's rhythm.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven and the others conceal this emotion beneath solemn, icy expressions and languid gestures. I thought to distinguish myself from the women in the cafés who were dressed up and pretentious.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw them, perfumed with the smell of gunpowder, singing light-hearted and brazen songs as they ran onto the stage. I thought that Steven found the martial gesture as if that of a general who had just won a battle.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that from this moment on, Steven would become another person, no longer the grandson of my grandmother, but rather a temporary younger brother to the young servant who would soon be serving the meals for the Stevenes, and he would only remember her when he stepped outside.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that Steven, who couldn't even reach the amount of beer that would take someone a week in Riverside, let alone champagne, now drank that much in an hour, plus a few drops of Bordeaux wine.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, who was absent-minded and unaware of the taste, and during his calm and lucid moments, the flavors of these drinks represented clearly commendable yet easily abandoned happiness.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the two \"Louis\" that Steven had saved up for a month, and I had originally intended to buy something with them, but at that moment I could no longer remember what it was, so I gave them to the violinist.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the waiters darting between the tables, some of them running at full speed, their outstretched hands holding plates of food. I thought this must be the end of the contest to see who would not drop their vegetable plate on the floor.\n[1897-07-31 01:08:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that indeed, the chocolate flan had arrived at its destination without spilling, the English fried potatoes, although they would have been jostled by the swift running, were still neatly arranged around the Boeuf à la Mode.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven notice a waiter, very tall, with dark, flowing hair, his face powdered like a mask. I thought that it made one more likely to recall certain rare birds rather than human beings.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw him running back and forth across the hall, as if without any purpose. I thought of a South American macaw, those macaws that fill the large bird cages of the zoo with their vividly colored feathers and their incomprehensible restlessness.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that soon, Steven would find the scene orderly, more refined, and calmer— at least in Steven's eyes— all those dizzying activities had condensed into a quiet harmony.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven looking at the round tables, which were filled with countless groups. I thought of Steven, who believed that each table was like a planet, like the planets in old allegorical paintings.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the irresistible force of gravity acting between these different planets.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the diners at each table, all staring at other tables, except for some wealthy host.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that he had a way of bringing in a famous writer, and by making use of the revolving table's features, he managed to coax the writer into saying meaningless things, which the ladies found extremely amusing.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw countless servants constantly moving about. I thought that Steven found a kind of harmony between these planet-like tables, and that didn't interfere with them.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that they were not sitting like the diners, but standing. I thought that was operating in the upper echelons.\n[1897-07-31 01:09:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw some running to deliver cold dishes, others changing the wine, and some adding more glasses.\n[1897-07-31 01:10:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that, despite these special reasons, they kept running back and forth around the table. I thought that in the end, the law governing this dizzying yet regular movement would have to be revealed.\n[1897-07-31 01:10:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw two utterly repulsive female cashiers sitting behind a large bunch of flowers, busily engaged in an endless tally of accounts. I thought of two female magicians, busy calculating the heavens to foresee the occasional great upheavals that would occur within this celestial sphere designed according to medieval science.\n[1897-07-31 01:10:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I felt sorry for all the people having dinner, because Steven thought that for them, these round tables were not planets, and in their dealings they never used any classification system that would free Steven and others from the constraints of their usual appearances, allowing them to see some similarities.\n[1897-07-31 01:10:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought about how they must be thinking that they were having dinner with someone, and how much it probably cost, and that they would have to come back the next day.\n[1897-07-31 01:10:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the young waiters' procession, and they seemed completely indifferent to it.\n[1897-07-31 01:10:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw these waiters probably had no urgent work at the moment, and were lined up passing around the bread baskets!\n[1897-07-31 01:10:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw a few who were especially young, and when the hotel manager passed by, he slapped them several times, knocking them off balance, their sad eyes staring blankly ahead.",

    "text": "[1897-07-31 01:10:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew they had once worked at the Riverside Hotel.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that if any of the guests from the Riverside hotel recognized them, and struck up a few words with them, personally ordering the unpalatable champagne to be removed. I felt very proud when I thought of them, and only then did I find some comfort.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven feeling his energy surge, which contained a comfortable element, but this was a comfort that existed apart from the external objects that could make Steven and others feel at ease.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the tiniest changes in the body and attention, which were enough to make Steven feel such comfort, just as a slight pressure was enough to make a closed eye perceive color.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that Steven had already drunk a lot of port wine. I thought that Steven still drank not so much for the sake of the new comfort that another few glasses would bring him, but because of the comfort already produced by the previous ones.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, how the music led Steven's happiness along with each beat, and happiness obediently settled into each beat.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the hotel in Springfield, which was similar to those chemical technologies, gathering many women at the same time. I thought about how thanks to chemical techniques, substances that could only be encountered by chance in nature could now be produced in large quantities, and the prospect of obtaining happiness from them stirred Steven's heart.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that in a year, Steven would not meet so many people through chance encounters on walks or travels. I thought about the other side of it, the music that Steven heard—the waltzes, German operettas, and café concert songs intermingling, all completely new to Steven.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of music itself as a place where gods themselves would find happiness, overlapping with another kind of happiness, yet more intoxicating than that other happiness.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of every melody as a woman, unique in her own way, yet unlike women, who keep the secret of their sensual pleasures for only a favored few.\n[1897-07-31 01:11:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of it, eager and greedy, approaching Steven with a defiant or wanton gait, striking up a conversation with Steven, touching Steven.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that Steven had suddenly become more attractive, stronger, or richer.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that Steven felt there was something very ruthless in these melodies, for they were utterly incompatible with any beauty that transcended material interests, with any gleam of wisdom.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that for them, there was only physical pleasure, and they presented this pleasure--the pleasure of the woman they loved being enjoyed by another man--as the only thing in the world to that poor jealous person, which was truly the most ruthless, the most inescapable hell.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven quietly repeating the notes of the melody, not giving it a kiss. I thought of how it conveyed to Steven a unique sensuality that made it so precious to him, to the point where Steven would even leave his parents behind to follow the melody into a strange world.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of it, building this strange world with its lines of notes, sometimes filled with lassitude, sometimes brimming with vitality, all invisible to the naked eye.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that whenever Stevens fail to win the favor of the women they're after, the women don't know whether at that moment the Stevenes are experiencing that subjective, inner state of extreme happiness. I thought that such happiness did not confer any higher value upon the person who obtained it, since only he himself could feel it, and thus it did not change her opinion of Steven at all.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that although this was the case, Steven still felt himself stronger and more vigorous, almost an irresistible man.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that Steven no longer saw his love as something repulsive, something others could sneer at, but rather as something truly beautiful and appealing, like music.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the music itself as a lovely place where Steven's beloved woman met Steven, and they immediately became close.\n[1897-07-31 01:12:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that the regulars at this hotel included not only women who had fallen into prostitution, but also people from the most refined social circles, who would come for tea around five o'clock or hold grand dinners here.\n[1897-07-31 01:13:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the tea service set up in a narrow, corridor-like glass passage running from the cloakroom to the dining room on one side and leading to the garden on the other. Apart from a few stone columns, the passage was separated from the garden only by glass windows.\n[1897-07-31 01:13:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I looked around and saw that the windows were open, resulting in not only cross breezes but also sudden bursts of strong light that made my eyes dazzle and the unstable lighting almost prevented me from seeing the ladies who had come for tea.\n[1897-07-31 01:13:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that, when these female guests sat two by two, pushing their tables together along this narrow neck of the bottle, every movement they made while drinking tea or greeting each other shone with brilliance.\n[1897-07-31 01:13:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought it was almost like a fishpond or a fish basket, where fishermen piled up brightly colored fish, their upper bodies out of the water, basking in the sunlight, flashing with ever-changing brilliance, like a mirror before people's eyes.\n[1897-07-31 01:13:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that dinner was naturally served in the dining room, where although the outside was still bright, the room was already lit with lamps. I knew that several hours had passed, and it was time for dinner.\n[1897-07-31 01:14:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw, looking forward from the dining room, the buildings in the garden, illuminated by the remaining sunlight, like pale-faced ghosts at night.\n[1897-07-31 01:14:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw groups of aspens beside the buildings, and a streak of sunset was passing through their pale green leaves.\n[1897-07-31 01:14:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw from the brightly lit dining room, through the glass window, that the green trees no longer seemed to be in a shimmering, damp fishnet. I thought of how, instead of those women Steven described, who took tea in the long corridor shining with blue and golden light, they were like the water plants in a vast, pale green fishpond illuminated by divine light.\n[1897-07-31 01:14:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw people leaving their seats. I knew that during the meal, all the guests spent their time looking at and identifying the guests at neighboring tables, and calling out the names of the guests at nearby tables, while maintaining a perfect cohesion around their own table.\n[1897-07-31 01:14:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw them go into the corridor where they had coffee. I thought of the gravitational pull that once centered around the host of a evening, which had now lost its powerful hold.\n[1897-07-31 01:15:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that it often happens that when someone passes by, a dinner in progress will abandon one or several of its tiny particles.\n[1897-07-31 01:15:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw this particle or these particles, drawn by the immense attraction of the other table, separate themselves from their own table. I knew that some of the gentlemen and ladies who had come to greet their friends had now taken their places.\n[1897-07-31 01:42:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard and then returned to my place, saying, \"Steven has to go, back to Mr. So-and-so... Steven is his guest tonight.\" I thought that, at this moment, one could say that the two bouquets had exchanged a few of their flowers.\n[1897-07-31 01:42:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw, and then the corridor itself gradually emptied. I often saw, even after dinner, that the sky was still light, and this long corridor remained unlit. The trees outside the glass windows swayed, giving the illusion of a path through a dark, wooded park.\n[1897-07-31 01:43:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that sometimes a lady dining would linger in the shadows for a long time.",

    "text": "[1897-08-01 01:36:47] Corridor of the Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven go out through the corridor one evening and found beautiful Sophia there, sitting among a group of people she didn't know.\n[1897-08-01 01:36:52] Corridor of the Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven take off his hat to greet her, but he didn't stop walking.\n[1897-08-01 01:36:57] Corridor of the Rivebelle Hotel | I saw her recognize Steven and she smiled, giving a slight nod. I thought of something far beyond this greeting, a few words rising from this very gesture to Steven, like celestial music.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:02] Corridor of the Rivebelle Hotel | I thought it might be a longer goodnight, not meant to make Steven stop, but simply an addition to that nod, forming a verbal greeting.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:07] Corridor of the Rivebelle Hotel | I saw it, but what the words actually meant was very vague and unclear, so Steven only heard the sound. I thought of that voice, so softly drawn out, which Steven found so musically beautiful, like a lark singing in the dark, delicate branches of a forest.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:12] Rivebelle | Sometimes I saw Peter happen to meet one of his friends, and then decide to spend the afternoon with them at an amusement park near the beach.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:17] Rivebelle | I saw that if he went with them, he would leave Steven alone in the carriage.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:22] Carriage | At that moment, Steven ordered the driver to urge the horse on with all his might. I thought that in order to prevent the time spent without any help from seeming so long, I wouldn't let Steven's sensitive heart recount all the changes he had undergone since Springfield—expressed through reflection and the effort to escape from the passive position he had fallen into, like a gear caught in a machine.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:27] Carriage | I saw that the narrow path was only wide enough for one carriage, and it was pitch black at night; there was a high chance of colliding with another carriage coming from the opposite direction.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:32] In the carriage | I often saw loose earth and stones tumbling down from the cliff, the road was uneven, and the steep cliff dropped abruptly into the sea right in front of me.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:37] Carriage | I thought that none of this could arouse even the slightest bit of strength in Steven's mind to bring back the awareness of danger and fear to his reason.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:42] In the carriage | I thought that what enabled Stevens to create a work was not the desire for fame and success, but the habit of diligence; what protected the future of Stevens was not the pleasure of the moment, but reflection on past wisdom.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:47] Carriage | I thought that what helped Steven's impaired minds find the right path was rational thinking and self-control, this pair of crutches.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:52] In the carriage | I thought, but if Steven arrived at Springfield, he would have already thrown away those crutches, and for once, relaxed his nerves, allowing himself to be in a state of mental disarray, under the influence of alcohol, which would mean that Steven was giving each moment of the present quality and charm.\n[1897-08-01 01:37:57] In the carriage | I thought the result would be neither making Steven more capable nor more determined to protect each minute.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:02] In the carriage | I thought of Steven, when he allowed himself to value these moments a thousand times more precious than the rest of his life, and his passion had already severed each minute from the remaining years of his life.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:07] In the carriage | I thought of Steven as a hero, closing himself off in the present like a drunkard.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:12] In the carriage | I thought of Steven's past, which had temporarily receded, no longer casting a shadow before Steven, and Steven called that shadow his future.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:17] In the carriage | I thought that Steven had ceased to set the purpose of his life in the realization of past dreams, and instead placed it in the pleasure of the present moment; Steven could not see anything further than this moment's joy.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:22] In the carriage | I thought that it was precisely at the moment when Steven felt especially happy, precisely when Steven believed he could live a happy life, precisely when Steven thought his life should have more meaning, that Steven freed himself from all the troubles that his life had so far been able to make him imagine. Without hesitation, Steven handed over his life to the accident.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:27] In the carriage | I thought that on the surface, this seemed contradictory, but it was only a superficial contradiction. In short, Steven had merely concentrated his recklessness into one evening, whereas for others, such recklessness was diluted throughout their entire existence.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:32] In the carriage | I thought about how, throughout their lives, they faced dangers hidden in daily sea voyages, plane rides, or car trips, and that the people who would be heartbroken by their deaths were waiting for them at home, expecting their return.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:37] In the carriage | I thought that the fact that a book was about to be published was the only reason they were still alive, and this book was connected to their fragile minds.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that, just like in the hotel at Springfield, during the nights when the Stevenes stayed there, if someone had come with the intention of killing Steven, he would have only seen Steven's grandmother, Steven's future life, and the book Steven was going to write, all in an unrealisticdistant view.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that Steven had completely merged with the scent of the woman at the next table, the polite manner of the hotel waiter, and the graceful and flowing melody of the waltz. I thought of Steven, who was entirely dependent on the present sensation, unable to think beyond it, with no other goal than not to be separated from it.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:52] Rivebelle Hotel | Whenever I thought of Steven, I would cling to that feeling and die, and Steven would let himself be killed without defending himself, motionless, like a bee numbed by tobacco smoke, no longer caring to protect the food it had painstakingly gathered, no longer hoping to save its hive.\n[1897-08-01 01:38:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought, in addition, that Steven should also have said that, in his heightened state of excitement, even the most serious matters seemed trivial, which finally allowed Steven to understand Madame Matthew and her girlfriends.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the great endeavor of making their acquaintance, which now seemed to Steven both effortless and indifferent, because only the intensity of Steven's present feelings, with each subtle variation, even just the mere continuation of this feeling, could bring Steven happiness and had real significance.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of everything else--my parents, my job, my amusements, the girls from Riverside--but none of it had any more weight than a speck of foam in the wind, existing only in relation to this intense inner feeling.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that getting drunk would realize for a few hours the subjective idealism, the pure theory of phenomena, and that everything was nothing but appearance, existing only in accordance with the nobility of Steven's own.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that it wasn't to say that true love couldn't exist in such a state—if the Stevenes did have feelings, but rather that the Stevenes felt, like newcomers to a place, that some inexplicable pressure had altered the scale of this emotion, so that they could no longer regard it with the same indifference.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that this same love could again be found by the Stevenes, but it would have shifted, no longer concerning themselves, content with the feeling given to them in the present, a feeling that was sufficient for the Stevenes, since they didn't care about anything non-present.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought it was a pity that such a change in values could only take effect at the moment of drunkenness, when nothing had any real importance anymore—people who were as insubstantial as soap bubbles, which vanish the moment you blow them, would once again regain their weight tomorrow.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought about having to make the effort to start again a research project that now seemed completely meaningless.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that even more seriously, this \"mathematics of tomorrow\" would, like the \"mathematics of yesterday,\" once again plunge the Stevenes helplessly into these math problems. It was, in fact, mathematics that still constrained the Stevenes even at such a moment, though it had in reality lost its power to constrain them.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that if, by chance, there were a dignified or an unfriendly woman near the Stevenes, the problem that had been so difficult the day before— even if the Stevenes could win her favor—now seemed a million times easier.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I realized that it was not actually the case, because this was only how it seemed to the Stevenes, only how it seemed to the Stevenes themselves, because the Stevenes had changed.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that at that very moment, if the Marceaux had been too forward, she would have been upset about it, just as the Marceaux would later be upset with themselves for having given a hundred francs as a tip to the waiter.\n[1897-08-01 01:39:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought the reasoning was the same: I was no longer drunk, but for Steven and others, reason had simply arrived too late.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the woman from Springfield that night, none of whom Steven knew; they became part of Steven's drunkenness, just as reflection is part of a mirror.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that all of them were a thousand times more in line with Steven's desires than Mademoiselle Ximene, and Mademoiselle Ximene was becoming increasingly nonexistent to Steven.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw a blonde girl, alone, looking sad, wearing a straw hat decorated with wild flowers, and she gazed at Steven for a long time, lost in thought. I thought she was so likable.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw, then it was another's turn, then the third, and finally a girl with a glowing complexion and chestnut hair.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that Peter was acquainted with almost all these girls, but Steven was not.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that before meeting the woman who would become his mistress, Peter had indeed lived for a long time in that extravagant and limited world.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that almost all the women who came to have dinner at Springfield were familiar to him; he or one of his friends had at least spent a night with each of them.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that many of them had come to the Springfield Hotel purely by chance; some had come to the seashore to reunite with their lovers, others were desperately trying to find one.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that if they were with a man, Peter would not greet them.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw them looking at Peter more than at the men beside them; by their expressions, it seemed they didn't know him. I thought that because everyone knew that, except for the actress, he now didn't care about any woman, and in the eyes of these women, this indifference gave him a special kind of authority.\n[1897-08-01 01:40:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard a woman whispering in a chatty way: \"That's little Peter. It seems he's always loved that prostitute. How romantic! He's really a handsome fellow! She thinks he's wonderful! What a good-looking man! Anyway, some women just have luck! And what a confident man he is!\"\n[1897-08-01 01:40:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard that Steven had been very close to the Duchess of Orléans, they were inseparable! He had squandered his money on her back then! But now he doesn't do that anymore. He doesn't betray her. Ah! She can really say she's lucky! Steven doesn't even know what he could get from her. He's definitely a big fool!\n[1897-08-01 01:41:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard her say, \"Her two feet are as big as boats, and she's got a mustache like an American woman. Her underclothes are terribly dirty! Her pants, Steven believes even a young factory girl wouldn't want! Look at those eyes of his—she'd jump into a fire for such a man! Hush, he's recognized Steven. He's smiling. Oh, he used to be very friendly with Steven. Just mention Steven to him.\"\n[1897-08-01 01:41:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw them exchange a knowing glance, letting Steven catch sight of it. I thought how I wished he would introduce Steven to these women, how I longed to be able to request a meeting with them, and how they would readily agree, even if Steven was unable to accept such an invitation.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that if it weren't so, in Steven's mind, their faces would forever lack that particular part which was unique to each of them—seemed to be hidden behind a veil—and this was what made every woman different.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that when they had not yet seen her, the Stevens could not imagine her, and only in the look she cast toward the Stevens did this aspect emerge, a look that approved of the Stevens' desires and promised them: their desires would be fulfilled.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of their faces, although Steven had only seen them partially, yet they still far surpassed the faces of the women Steven imagined would probably behave properly.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of the faces of those women, which bore no resemblance to these girls—plain, shallow, flat, without depth.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that the faces of these girls must have meant something different to Steven than they did to Peter.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that he was obviously indifferent to the effort of pretending not to know him, and his greeting was as unremarkable as one might offer to anyone.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of how, indifferent or commonplace as he was, he would recall in his heart, and before his eyes there would appear disheveled hair, a frenzied mouth, and half-open, half-closed eyes.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of this entire silent painting, like those paintings that artists cover with a decent oil painting in order to deceive most of the viewers.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, who felt that not the slightest bit of himself had ever entered the minds of any of these women, nor would anything of him be carried along the uncertain path that each of them would take through life.\n[1897-08-01 01:41:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that for Steven, these faces had always been closed off, but knowing that these faces had once smiled was enough to make Steven feel it was a reward.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that if their faces were not circular ornaments hiding memories of love, but just beautiful medals, Steven would not have found them valuable.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that as for Peter, he could never sit properly, and he masked his warrior's restless desire with the smile of a court favorite.",

    "text": "[1897-08-01 01:42:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw, beneath the delicate skin, bold architectural structures, the art of architecture from the feudal era. When I thought about examining him closely, Steven realized that the energetic structure of his triangular face was an exact replica of his ancestors, more suitable for a passionate archer than for a refined scholar.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw his head, which made me think of the towers on the main keep of an ancient castle, where the useless crenellations were still visible, but inside, these towers had been converted into libraries.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:22] On the way back to Balbec | I thought about one of the strange women he had introduced to Steven, and how Steven, without stopping for a single second and almost without realizing it, kept repeating in his mind: \"What a sweet young woman!\"\n[1897-08-01 01:42:27] On the way back to Balbec | I thought of it as a kind of refrain, natural, more precisely, these words came from an overexcited nervous state rather than a lasting judgment.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:32] On the way back to Balbec | I thought that if Steven had had a thousand francs on him and if there had been a jewelry shop still open at that time, Steven would certainly have bought a ring for that strange girl, and it was true.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:37] On the way back to Balbec | I thought about how, when Stevenes spend certain moments of their lives in extremely different environments, they often give too generously to all sorts of people.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:42] On the way back to Balbec | I thought that the next day, I would probably find these people utterly dull. But people feel responsible for what they said the day before and want to keep their promises.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:47] Bedroom | I arrived late that evening, returning to Steven's room, and saw the bed; Steven was happy. I thought of the room, which no longer held any hostility for Steven. On the day he first arrived, he had thought he would never be able to rest in this bed!\n[1897-08-01 01:42:52] Bedroom | I saw Steven's thighs, Steven's buttocks, Steven's shoulders, one after another, trying as much as possible to merge with the sheet covering the mattress. I thought that, now, my exhausted limbs needed to find a support here, as if Steven's exhaustion were like a sculptor trying to obtain a complete human mold.\n[1897-08-01 01:42:57] Bedroom | I thought of Steven, who couldn't sleep, and Steven felt that dawn was approaching.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:02] Bedroom | I thought of a calm mind and a healthy body, but they no longer existed. In his melancholy, Steven seemed to feel that he would never regain them again, and Steven would have to sleep for a long time before he could get them back.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:07] Bedroom | I saw that even if I took a short nap, I would be awakened two hours later by the symphony concert. I thought, but Steven suddenly fell asleep, sinking into a dream.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:12] Dream | I thought of dreams, of returning to my youth, of lost years coming back, of lost feelings rekindled, of my soul leaving my body and wandering about, of memories of the dead, of absurd fantasies about life, of retreating to an age when nature was the most primitive ruler.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:17] Dream | I know that it's said that Steven and others often see animals in their dreams, but I had forgotten that in their dreams, Steven and others are almost always irrational animals themselves, and it is this very rationality that casts a definite light upon things.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:22] Dream | I thought the opposite: that Steven, in his dreams, only offered an unreliable view of scenes from life, and each minute this view was forgotten and destroyed. The previous scene vanished before the next one, just like a magic lantern, where one picture is replaced by another, and the previous one disappears.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:27] Dream | I thought about all these mysteries, which the Stevens believed they didn't understand, yet the Stevens were actually in the process of encountering them almost every night, as well as another great mystery, the mystery of destruction and rebirth.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:32] Dream | I saw Steven talking to Thomas just now in a dream. I thought of certain places in my past that had already grown dim, and now they were being illuminated one by one. The dinner at Springfield was difficult to digest, making this lightness even more uncertain, which made Steven into a person for whom the highest happiness seemed to be meeting Thomas.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:37] Dream | I thought that indeed, even Steven's own life was completely blocked from view by a new set, just like the scenery placed on a stage.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:42] Dream | When I saw the scene changes in the backstage, some actors were performing a funny program on the main stage. I thought of the funny program in which Steven played a role, with the flavor of an Eastern story.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:47] Dream | I thought that because the set was extremely close to an Oriental style, Steven in the play had no knowledge of his past, not even of himself; Steven was merely a character who had been beaten and punished in various ways for his transgressions.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:52] Dream | I realized what the fault was, which Steven had not noticed—that it was simply drinking too much port.\n[1897-08-01 01:43:57] Bedroom | I saw Steven suddenly wake up, and I realized that thanks to this long sleep, he had not heard the noise of the symphony concert.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:00] Bedroom | It was already afternoon when I saw it. Steven tried hard to sit up and look at his watch, wanting to know for sure.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:05] Bedroom | I saw that at first, no matter how hard I tried, it was of no use. My head again sank heavily onto the pillow, and I gave up halfway. I thought this was a brief descent following drowsiness and other states of intoxication, or caused by drinking or by recovering from a serious illness.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:10] Bedroom | I thought, even before looking at the time, that it was certainly past noon, and Steven as well.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:15] Bedroom | I saw Steven tossing and turning, speaking, no longer having any weight, no center of gravity. Steven was thrown out, as if he could continue his gloomy run all the way to the moon. I thought of last night, when Steven was nothing more than a hollowed-out, weightless man (like someone who must first lie down before he can sit up, or sleep before he can stop talking).\n[1897-08-01 06:59:20] Bedroom | I thought that although I was asleep, Steven's eyes did not see the passage of time, but his body could still calculate it.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:25] Bedroom | I thought of it not as measuring time on the surface of a clock face, but rather as gradually weighing how much of Steven's strength had been restored.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:30] Bedroom | I thought of Steven's body as a large clock, with strength flowing from the mind down to the rest of the body in stages. Now, this strength had accumulated in solid quantity all the way up to his knees.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:35] Bedroom | I know that if, in the past, the sea was the environment on which Steven's life depended, it was necessary to return Steven's blood to the sea in order to restore their strength. I thought that the situation was the same with forgetting and spiritual emptiness.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:40] Bedroom | I thought that sometimes, within a few hours, it seemed as if time had been suspended, but during that time, the effort that had accumulated without being spent was measured by its quantity, just as accurately as time measured by the weight of a clock or the collapse of a sand dune.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:45] Bedroom | I thought to myself that waking up from such a sleep was no easier than trying to fall asleep after staying up all night; everything has a tendency to continue.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:50] Bedroom | I thought that if certain anesthetics do indeed make people fall asleep, then prolonged sleep is a stronger anesthetic, and it's difficult to wake up after such a long sleep.\n[1897-08-01 06:59:55] Bedroom | I thought of Steven like a sailor who clearly saw his ship's ropes tied to the dock, yet the vessel still swayed with the waves.\n[1897-08-01 07:00:00] Bedroom | I saw that Steven really wanted to look at the time, to get up. I thought about it, but Steven's body was once again thrown into sleep every single moment.\n[1897-08-01 14:59:50] Bedroom | I saw that landing was difficult; Steven collapsed onto his pillow two or three times before finally standing up and walking over to Steven's watch.\n[1897-08-01 14:59:55] Bedroom | I saw the time on the watch being compared to the time indicated by the rich materiality of Steven's limp legs.\n[1897-08-01 15:00:00] Bedroom | I saw at last that Steven finally understood: \"At two o'clock!\" Steven rang the bell, but he immediately fell back to sleep.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:10] Bedroom | I thought that, given the calm I felt when Steven woke up again and the sense that a long night had passed, this time I must have slept for much longer.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:15] Bedroom | I saw that Steven's awakening was caused by Françoise entering the room, and she entered because Steven had rung the bell. I thought I had fallen asleep this time, and Steven himself felt that it had probably lasted longer than the previous time, bringing him such a sense of ease and forgetfulness, although in fact it had only lasted half a minute.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:20] Bedroom | I saw David open Steven's door, and Steven immediately began firing a series of questions at her about the Thomas family.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:30] Bedroom | I realized that merely saying Steven had regained his calm and health was far from enough, because this went well beyond the simple question of how much calmer and healthier Steven was compared to the day before.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:35] Bedroom | I thought of Steven struggling against the current all night long, and then, not only did Steven return to peace and health, but peace and health themselves returned to Steven.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:40] Bedroom | I thought my head was empty, and one day it would probably shatter; there were a few specific places on top of my head that hurt.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:45] Bedroom | I thought of the mind, allowing Steven's thoughts to roam freely, and then thoughts once again took their places and met life again.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:50] Bedroom | I thought it was sad that, even to this day, Steven's mind still does not properly make use of Steven's life.\n[1897-08-01 23:38:55] Bedroom | I thought of Steven once again escaping the torment of insomnia, evading the chaos of the universe, and avoiding the destruction of a nervous breakdown.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:00] Bedroom | I thought of everything Paul had threatened to do to Steven the night before, when Steven had been unable to find peace; now, Steven was no longer afraid at all.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:05] Bedroom | I thought of a new life unfolding before me, although Steven was already quite comfortable, it still felt as if my bones had fallen apart.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:10] Bedroom | I saw Steven motionless, savoring with joy his own exhaustion. I thought that fatigue had dislocated Steven's bones in his legs and arms, breaking them, and now Steven felt these bones gathered before him, ready to be reassembled.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:15] Bedroom | I thought that if I sang, like the architect in the fable, Steven would be able to re-erect the framework.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:20] Bedroom | I thought suddenly, Steven recalled the golden-haired girl with a melancholy expression who had looked at him for a while in Springfield.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:25] Bedroom | I thought of the entire evening, of many other girls who looked pleasant, but now, only she had just risen from the depths of Steven's memory.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:30] Bedroom | I thought Steven must have felt that she had noticed him, and that a waiter from Springfield would come to deliver a message to Steven on her behalf.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:35] Bedroom | I thought that Peter didn't know her, but considered her decent, and that meeting her, often meeting her, might be difficult, but Steven would do anything for it; Steven thought only of her.\n[1897-08-01 23:39:40] Bedroom | I know that philosophy often speaks of free actions and necessary actions.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:00] Bedroom | I thought of an action that, by suppressing lift during the process, would allow a particular memory to resurface once Steven's thoughts had settled down—this memory had been leveled with other memories by the pressure of distraction—until now—and then set it surging forward, because it was more enchanting than the others.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:05] Bedroom | I thought of the Stevenes, who had not realized it at the time, and only discovered it twenty-four hours later.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:10] Bedroom | I can think of no behavior more fully experienced by the Stevenets than this one, and perhaps none more free, since it does not yet have the nature of a habit.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:15] Bedroom | I thought that in love, it is precisely this mental quirk that helps revive the image of a particular person.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:20] Bedroom | The next day after Steven had seen that group of beautiful women walking along the seashore, Steven asked several regular guests at the Riverside hotel about them.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:30] Bedroom | I knew they had not been able to tell Steven anything, and then a photograph explained why.\n[1897-08-01 23:40:50] Bedroom | I knew that just a few years earlier, they had still been a group of childish, unfinished, and wonderfully sweet little girls, whom one could see sitting in a circle on the sand around the tent.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:10] Bedroom | I knew they were like faint, distant white star clusters. I thought that even if you could discern a pair of eyes brighter than the others in this indistinct galaxy of nebulae, they would immediately be forgotten and blend in with the rest.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:15] Bedroom | I knew that, although they were still in the age of the \"girl's eighteen changes,\" they had indeed already passed that age. Who could recognize them as the same group of girls from a few years ago?\n[1897-08-01 23:41:20] Bedroom | I thought that in those not-so-distant years, they certainly did not give the impression of a group, as they had done the day before when first appearing before Steven.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:25] Bedroom | I thought of this group, which at that time was still not clearly defined; those children were too young, still in the basic stage of formation, and their personalities had not yet left their mark on each face.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:30] Bedroom | I thought that, rather like a primitive organ existing in a formless state, the individual was more accurately made up of coral skeletons than of the individual polyps that composed the coral skeletons.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:35] Bedroom | I saw that at the time, they were still packed together, you pushing Steven, Steven pushing you, and sometimes a child would knock over the child beside him, and then there would be a burst of laughter. I thought that perhaps this was the only manifestation of their individual lives.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:40] Bedroom | I saw everyone laughing uncontrollably. I thought of those hazy, grotesque faces merged into a jiggling mass of jelly, shining and trembling.\n[1897-08-01 23:41:45] Bedroom | I know that on an old photograph, which they later showed to Steven and which Steven kept, the childish group had already the same number of faces as their later procession.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:05] Bedroom | I found myself glancing at them, unable to stop thinking that they must have left some extraordinary impression on the beach.",

    "text": "[1897-08-01 23:42:10] Bedroom | I thought that people could only recognize them one by one through reason, and that even though a daughter changed repeatedly, it was only when these newly recombined forms gradually took over another person with a distinct personality that the boundary was reached, and then one had to identify that other person with a distinct personality.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:15] Bedroom | I knew that tall stature and curly hair coexisted. I thought that another beautiful face might very well be the thin, pale little girl shown in the photograph album.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:20] Bedroom | I thought of these girls, whose physical features had changed so much in such a short time that these features had become a vague standard.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:25] Bedroom | I knew that from then on, the common and seemingly collective aspects between them became so prominent. I thought that sometimes even their best friends would confuse one for the other in this photo.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:30] Bedroom | I thought the only way to dispel the doubt was through some small article of clothing; only then could I be certain that someone had worn such clothes and put on such an item, while others definitely had not.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:35] Bedroom | I thought about how different that season was from the day when Steven had just seen them on the seawall, and how close those two times were to each other.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:40] Bedroom | I knew that since that season, they still laughed as loudly as Steven had felt the day before. I thought of it, but this laughter was no longer the intermittent, almost spontaneous laughter of childhood.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:45] Bedroom | I saw that the former convulsive relaxation could instantly send these minds plunging into a dive. I thought of the fish in the River Véfina, scattering, vanishing, then gathering again into a school after a little while.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:50] Bedroom | I saw that now, their appearances had become their own masters, each of them staring intently at the goal they were pursuing.\n[1897-08-01 23:42:55] Bedroom | I thought only Steven, in his uncertain and trembling way yesterday, when he first caught a vague glimpse of them, could have confused these spores, just as the laughter of days gone by and the old photographs had once blended them all together.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:00] Bedroom | I thought that by now, these spores had acquired personalities of their own, separate from the pale coral.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:05] Bedroom | I saw that, many times, when a beautiful girl passed by Steven, Steven would make a promise to himself to meet her again.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:10] Bedroom | I thought that generally, they would no longer appear, and besides, memory would soon forget them, making it hard to find their faces again.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:15] Bedroom | I thought that before Steven's eyes had even recognized them, they would have already seen other girls passing by, girls who Steven would never meet again in the future.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:20] Bedroom | I thought of other times, like this arrogant group, when they would inevitably have to appear again before Steven's eyes.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:25] Bedroom | At this moment, the Stevenes felt it was a beautiful accident, because from this accident they would discern what had seemed to be the elements that formed and developed in the very beginning of their existence, composing their lives.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:30] Bedroom | I thought that, in the end, Stevenes would consider these images as destined, and that this kind of chance would turn their loyalty to certain images into something easy and inevitable, sometimes—after certain interruptions that made one wish to stop remembering—something cruel.\n[1897-08-01 23:43:35] Bedroom | I thought that without this chance encounter, the Stevenes would probably have been forgotten just as easily as so many others, right from the start.\n[1897-08-02 18:16:20] Balbec | I knew that Peter's stay was soon coming to an end.\n[1897-08-02 18:32:34] Beach | I saw that Steven had not met those girls again on the beach.\n[1897-08-02 18:48:48] Balbec | I knew that Peter would only be in Riverside for a short time in the afternoon, too brief to attend to them or to make their acquaintance for Steven's sake.\n[1897-08-03 00:40:32] Rivebelle | I saw that in the evening he had more time, and he still often took Steven to Springfield.\n[1897-08-03 00:40:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, who discovered that in these restaurants, just as in parks and on trains, some people remained invisible beneath their ordinary appearances, and their names would surprise Stevenes.\n[1897-08-03 00:40:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of asking them their names, and the Stevenes would then realize that they were not just insignificant people, as the Stevenes had thought, but precisely a certain minister or Samuel, whose name they had long heard of.\n[1897-08-03 00:40:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that when Peter and Steven noticed everyone starting to leave, a man had just arrived and sat down at a table (this had happened two or three times already).\n[1897-08-03 00:40:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw the man who entered Steven's view: tall and well-built, with a regular face and white beard, but his thoughtful eyes were always fixed intently on the sky.\n[1897-08-03 00:40:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw one evening that the Stevens asked the waiter who this gloomy, solitary, and late-arriving customer was.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard him say to the Stevenes, \"Well, this is the famous painter George, don't you recognize him?\"\n[1897-08-03 00:41:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that once, Matthew mentioned this name to Steven. I thought about how to bring it up, but Steven had completely forgotten.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought, but just as a lapse in memory is sometimes not an obstacle to grasping something uncertain, but rather leads to an early certainty, so too with the oversight of a particular sentence while reading.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard Steven say to Peter, \"He's a friend of Matthew, a very famous and wealthy artist.\"\n[1897-08-03 00:41:22] Rivebelle Hotel | As I thought, a shiver seemed to pass over both him and Steven, and both of them thought that George was a great artist, a celebrity.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought, and then Steven thought, that he had blended Steven and the other diners into one group, and surely hadn't expected how excited Steven's genius was.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, who was unaware of the admiration that Steven's peers felt for him, and who also did not know that Steven's peers knew Matthew.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought to myself: If the Stevenes hadn't come for the sea baths, they probably wouldn't have suffered this ordeal.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that Steven had written a letter, signed with Steven's name. I thought, but Stevens still lingered in that age when they were unable to keep their passion silent, and I put myself in their place, imagining the oppressive life of living under a false name.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I read in the letter that the Marceaux had confided to George that the two diners sitting a few paces away were two amateur enthusiasts who were extremely devoted to his talent, friends of Matthew.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that in the letter, the Stevenes asked to extend their respects to him, and a waiter was assigned the task of delivering the letter to that famous person.\n[1897-08-03 00:41:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that George, although already quite well known, was not yet as famous as the hotel owner claimed he was; it was only a few years later that he became really famous.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew he was the one who had first come here to live when it was still just a farmhouse, bringing with him a group of artists.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I know those artists, who all move elsewhere once the farm where people ate under a simple rain-sheltered awning becomes an upscale dining center.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that George himself lived not far from here with his wife, and it was only because she wasn't there that he had come back to the hotel.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of a great genius, whose very existence, even before he had been recognized, would inevitably provoke certain acts of worship.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I know of more than one Englishwoman who, during a brief stopover, was extremely curious about George's life. The farmer could guess something from the questions the Englishwoman asked or from the many letters the painter received from abroad.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that at this moment the boss was more attentive: George did not like to be disturbed when he was painting; under the clear moonlight, he would get up late at night and take a small model to the sea, making her stand naked in position.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought to myself that it was worth all the effort, and the tourists' praise was not without reason, when the boss recognized the wooden cross hanging at the entrance to Springfield from a painting by George.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I heard him exclaiming in astonishment, \"It's this crucifix, all four pieces are here! Oh, how much effort he must have put into it!\"\n[1897-08-03 00:42:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew, but whether the small painting of \"Sunrise at Sea\" that George had given him was worth a fortune, he didn't know.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw Steven and the others see George read their letter, put it in his pocket, continue eating, then ask for his coat, stand up, and leave.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought for certain that Steven's behavior was annoying him, and now Steven really wanted (and also feared) to slip away before he noticed Steven.\n[1897-08-03 00:42:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of one thing that Steven and his friends never considered, yet in their eyes it was the most important thing: the passion that Steven and his friends felt for George, a passion they would not allow anyone to question or doubt.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that the Stevenes could indeed prove, with the anxious heart they carried during the wait, their willingness to risk everything for this great man, but this enthusiasm was not, as the Stevenes themselves imagined, a sign of admiration, since they had never actually seen any of George's works.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that the object of Steven's emotions was probably the empty concept of a \"great artist,\" rather than a work that Steven had never seen.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that, at best, it was a hollow admiration, an empty framework of admiration, a skeletal structure of feeling—something connected to childhood, just like certain organs that no longer exist in adults, and so the Stevenes were still children.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that George was about to reach the door when he suddenly turned and came toward us.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Steven, both surprised and delighted, overwhelmed with tension.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that, several years later, Steven would no longer feel this way, because as people grow older, their abilities decline, and becoming accustomed to social occasions makes one never again think of seizing such an unusual opportunity or feeling such excitement.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw George sitting at the table with Steven and speaking a few words to them. I heard Steven mention Matthew to him several times, but he never answered Steven.\n[1897-08-03 00:43:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw him, and he didn't stop inviting Steven to come visit him in his studio at Riverside. I thought that Steven had initially believed he didn't know Matthew.\n[1897-08-03 00:44:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew this invitation had not been extended to Peter, because Steven had said a few words that made him believe Steven was fond of art and thus earned the invitation.\n[1897-08-03 00:44:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that even if George and Matthew were close friends, Matthew's recommendation probably wouldn't have had such an effect (because in life, the proportion of emotions that are free from self-interest is greater than people think).\n[1897-08-03 00:44:12] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of how kind he was to Steven, even more so than Peter, just as Peter's kindness surpassed the politeness of a petty bourgeois.\n[1897-08-03 00:44:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that compared to the kindness of a great artist, the kindness of a nobleman, no matter how touching, always had an air of acting and affectation.\n[1897-08-03 00:44:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought of Peter, who went to great lengths to be liked, while George loved giving and sacrificing.\n[1897-08-03 00:44:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I knew that everything he possessed—his thoughts, his works, and all the rest he considered secondary—would be gladly given to someone who understood him.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I know, but he didn't have a social circle that he could endure on his own; he lived in solitude, with a wild element to him.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:22] Rivebelle Hotel | I know that people in the upper classes call this pretentiousness, lack of refinement; those in power call it having the wrong ideas; neighbors call it insanity; and family members call it selfishness and arrogance.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:27] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that, at first, even in solitude, he had happily considered that through his work he could speak to those who did not understand or had offended him, allowing them to know themselves fully.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:32] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that perhaps he lived alone not out of indifference to others, but out of love for them, just as Steven had given up Michael in order to one day reappear in a more charming form.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:37] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that perhaps his work was meant for certain people, like returning to them, and in this return, people would like him, admire him, and talk about him, even though they had not seen him himself.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:42] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that whether they were patients, monks, artists, or heroes, when Stevenes decided to give something up with their original mindset, it was not always entirely complete at first. Later, through reaction, it finally had an effect on the Stevenes.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:47] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that if he had ever wished to paint for certain people, then when he was painting, he was living for himself, away from the society he had grown indifferent to.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:52] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that the practice of solitude had made him love solitude, just as Steven and others at first feared every important matter.\n[1897-08-03 00:45:57] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that because the Stevenes knew that such a major matter was incompatible with smaller ones, and the Stevenes placed great importance on small matters.\n[1897-08-03 00:46:02] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought that great matters did not take away Steven's small concerns, but rather set Steven free from them.\n[1897-08-03 00:46:07] Rivebelle Hotel | I thought about how, before experiencing great events, Steven's entire focus was on figuring out to what extent they could reconcile their lives with some small pleasures, but once they experienced great events, those little joys no longer seemed like joy at all.\n[1897-08-03 00:46:17] Rivebelle Hotel | I saw that George hadn't spoken with the Marceaux for very long, and Steven was preparing to visit his studio two or three days later.",

    "text": "[1897-08-04 01:42:47] Corner of Balbec Street | I saw it, but the next evening, Steven accompanied David as they walked from the end of the seawall toward the cliffs of Cancale. When they returned, at a street corner leading to the beach, Steven and his grandmother encountered a young girl.\n[1897-08-04 01:43:02] Corner of Balbec Street | What I saw entering Steven's eyes was her, her head bowed like a beast reluctantly driven back to the pen, holding a golf club in her hand, followed by a domineering man.\n[1897-08-04 01:43:07] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought that the man was probably his \"English governess,\" or perhaps the \"English governess\" of one of his girlfriends.\n[1897-08-04 01:43:22] Corner of Balbec Street | I saw Steven looking at the man, who bore a striking resemblance to the portrait of the Jeffries family in Hogarth's work. His face was red, probably because his favorite drink wasn't tea, but gin.\n[1897-08-04 01:43:37] Corner of Balbec Street | I saw him with his white, thick mustache, and the unchewed tobacco sticking out blackly as a crooked hook, which made the mustache even longer.\n[1897-08-04 01:43:42] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought of the girl walking ahead of him, who was very similar to that one among the group of young girls—a girl wearing a black equestrian-style hat, with plump cheeks, a rather expressionless face, but eyes that smiled.\n[1897-08-04 01:43:57] Corner of Balbec Street | I saw that this one returning home was also wearing a black polo cap, but Steven thought she was more beautiful than the other one; her nose had a straighter line, and the lower part of her nostrils were wider, with more flesh.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:02] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought that, in front of Steven, the first girl had appeared pale and proud, while the second one seemed like a child who had been tamed, with a rosy complexion.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:07] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought, however, that since she was pushing the same bicycle and wearing the same deerskin gloves, Steven concluded that the difference he saw might have been due to his own different position and circumstances.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:12] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought that it was unlikely there would be another girl in Riverside with such a similar face, and who also had the same characteristics in her short hairstyle.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:22] Corner of Balbec Street | I saw her quickly glance toward Steven.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:27] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought that in the days to come, when Steven would again see this group on the beach, and even later, when Steven had met all the girls who made up the group, he would never have been absolutely certain which of them was the girl he had seen that evening at the end of the beach, at the corner of the street.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:32] Corner of Balbec Street | I thought even among all the people, the girl who looked most like her, the one pushing a bicycle, the girl that Steven had noticed in this group, although the difference wasn't great, there was still some difference.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:37] Balbec | I thought back to a few days earlier, when Steven had been especially preoccupied with the tall girl, but from that afternoon on, it was again the girl with the golf club, whom Steven had imagined was Miss Simone, who once more unsettled him completely.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:52] Balbec | When I saw her with someone else, I often stopped in my tracks, forcing her girlfriends—apparently very respectful of her—to stop moving as well.\n[1897-08-04 01:44:57] Balbec | I thought of Steven, and before my eyes the image still floated of her stopping in her steps, her eyes shining beneath her polo cap, this figure reflected on the sea behind her, which formed a screen for her, the transparent blue space between her and Steven, and the time that had passed since then.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:02] Balbec | The first image I thought of, in Steven's memory, was very faint. Steven longed for it, pursued it, then forgot it, and later found it again.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:07] Balbec | I thought that ever since then, Steven often projected this face onto the past, so that when he faced a girl in his room, he could secretly think to himself, \"It's her!\"\n[1897-08-04 01:45:12] Balbec | I thought, but perhaps what Steven most wanted to meet was the girl with a face like a carnation and green eyes.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:17] Balbec | I thought, after all, no matter which girl Steven wished to see on any given day, even if not for that one, the others would be enough to stir Steven's emotions.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:22] Balbec | I thought of Steven's desires, which, even if they were directed this time toward one woman and next time toward another, still, like Steven's vague vision on the first day, continued to bring them together, continuing to see them as a single, separate world.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:27] Balbec | I thought of a shared life that animated this small world, and perhaps they too hoped to form this isolated little world!\n[1897-08-04 01:45:32] Balbec | I thought that if Steven became the boyfriend of one of them, he would probably enter—like a delicate pagan or a cautious Christian in a barbarian land—a circle that would make him seem even younger.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:37] Balbec | I thought that Steven found this circle full of health, unconsciousness, sensuality, cruelty, non-intellectuality, and joy.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:42] Balbec | I saw Steven telling David about his brief meeting with George. I felt happy that she was pleased with the various spiritual benefits Steven was getting from George's friendship, and I thought it was absurd and unfeeling that Steven had not yet visited George.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:47] Balbec | I saw Steven not daring to go far away. I thought, but Steven was only thinking about that small group, and he had no idea when those girls would pass by the seawall.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:52] Balbec | I saw Steven change his hat every day, never wearing the same one twice, and even wrote to Willowbrook to have new hats and new cravats sent to him. I thought of David's surprise at Steven's well-dressed appearance, because Steven had suddenly remembered the formal suit that had been lying in the bottom of the trunk until then.\n[1897-08-04 01:45:57] Balbec | I thought of places like Riverside, seaside resorts where, if a beautiful young girl, a seller of seafood, candy, or flowers, was painted in vivid colors in the minds of Stevens, then for those Stevens, each day from morning on would become the goal of those idle yet sunny days spent on the beach.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:02] Balbec | I found life greatly enriched by this, for even though the days were idle, as easygoing as certain workdays, they were drawn in a certain direction, attracted by a magnet, slightly raised toward some approaching moment.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:07] Balbec | I thought this was the moment when people, while buying oil cakes, roses, and ammonites, would become delighted by seeing, on a woman's face, bright colors that seemed to be freshly sprinkled on a flower.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:12] Balbec | I thought, but first of all, these street vendors, one could at least speak to them, which spared the need to build, through imagination, other aspects beyond the simple visual ones that Steven was given, to re-create their lives, to exaggerate their charm, as one would before a portrait.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:17] Balbec | I thought that, precisely because I was talking to them, I would find out where and when I could see them again.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:22] Balbec | I thought, but for Steven, it was by no means the same thing, at least as far as that small group of girls was concerned.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:27] Balbec | I thought about their habits, which Steven did not know. On certain days, they would disappear without a trace, and I didn't know why they weren't there.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:32] Balbec | I tried to find a pattern when thinking about Steven: whether they had a fixed time for not appearing, whether I could only see them once every two days, or whether it had something to do with the weather, or whether there were certain days when I would never see them at all.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:37] Balbec | I thought of Steven, who had already imagined himself as their friend, and who said to them, \"On such and such a day, you won't be there?\" \"Ah yes, that was on Saturday, the Saturdays when Stevens never come, because...\"\n[1897-08-04 01:46:42] Balbec | I thought about Steven, who still wanted to find an answer: if you know that the bleak Saturday is hopeless, no matter how desperately you run around on the beach, sit in front of a pastry shop pretending to eat cream pastries, step into odd little shops, wait for the time of seawater baths, the concert, the high tide, sunset, nightfall—yet you never see that small group of people you long for—would everything then be just as simple?\n[1897-08-04 01:46:47] Balbec | I thought of that fateful day, which might not come just once a week, and might not necessarily fall on Saturday.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:52] Balbec | I thought that perhaps certain climatic conditions might also have an influence, or perhaps they had nothing to do with the climate at all.\n[1897-08-04 01:46:57] Balbec | I thought about how many patient yet restless observations would be needed to confirm that I had not been deceived by coincidence, that Steven's estimates were correct, and how one could finally establish precise laws for this exciting astronomical phenomenon!\n[1897-08-04 01:47:02] Balbec | I thought to myself, this was earned through painful experience!\n[1897-08-04 01:47:07] Balbec | I saw it just then, and Steven faintly caught sight of them. I thought that sometimes Steven would recall a day like today, when he hadn't seen them, and secretly wondered whether they wouldn't come, finding it pointless to linger on the beach.\n[1897-08-04 01:47:12] Balbec | I thought about the reverse: one day, Steven believed that some pattern dictated when these stars would return. Steven calculated that day to be an auspicious one, yet they didn't come out.\n[1897-08-04 01:47:17] Balbec | I wondered whether Steven might see them, which was the first of the uncertain matters.\n[1897-08-04 01:47:22] Balbec | I thought of another more serious uncertainty: whether Steven would ever meet them again, since Steven had no idea whether they were going to America or returning to Willowbrook.\n[1897-08-04 01:47:27] Balbec | It was enough for Steven to think about this to begin falling in love with them. One can have a taste for a person, but to feel that melancholy, which serves as a prelude to love, irreparable and unbearable, leading to an uncontrolled restlessness, one must have the danger of \"impossibility.\"\n[1897-08-04 01:47:32] Balbec | I thought of \"impossibility,\" a dangerous and restless yearning to find a target to passionately embrace, perhaps the target is right here, not on a person.\n[1897-08-04 01:47:37] Balbec | I thought about how the recurring influence during successive love affairs was already at work, at least these influences were constantly recurring when Steven was involved in successive relationships.\n[1897-08-04 01:47:42] Balbec | I thought that it was possible for one to have successive love affairs, but I suppose it was more a matter of city life (for the factory girls, you never knew which day they would be off, and you feared missing them when they left the workshop).\n[1897-08-04 01:47:47] Balbec | I thought that it might be inseparable from love, that perhaps all the special aspects of the first love would, through memory, insight, and habit, be added to later loves, through the various stages of life that followed Steven's, thereby giving each aspect of those later loves a certain universality.",

    "text": "[1897-08-07 18:12:42] Balbec | I found Steven making all sorts of excuses to go to the beach during the moments when he hoped to meet them.\n[1897-08-07 18:12:47] Balbec Restaurant | I once saw Steven having lunch, and he spotted them from afar.\n[1897-08-08 04:45:27] Balbec Seawall | I was sorry that Steven arrived too late; he had waited on the seawall for a long time, waiting for them to pass by.\n[1897-08-08 09:40:49] Restaurant Balbec | I saw that after that, Steven stayed only a short time in the dining room, his eyes searching the blue glass window.\n[1897-08-08 09:40:59] Balbec Restaurant | I saw that the after-dinner sweets hadn't been served yet, so Steven got up, afraid that if he waited any longer, he might miss them.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:09] Restaurant Balbec | I thought of David, who would stay with Steven longer than Steven considered advantageous, and this made Steven angry, which became her own unconscious spitefulness (Steven tilted his chair to extend his view as much as possible).\n[1897-08-08 09:41:14] Restaurant Balbec | I thought that if Steven happened to catch a glimpse of any one of these girls, since they all belonged to the same special breed, he would see the shadow of a dream within the monstrous illusion moving before his eyes.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:19] Restaurant Balbec | I thought of this dream opposing Steven, who passionately longed for it.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:24] Balbec Restaurant | I thought that before this moment, this dream had only existed in Steven's mind, and afterward it would often linger there.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:29] Balbec Restaurant | I thought that Steven did not love any one in particular; Steven loved them all, and the chance of meeting them was the only sweet element that made life bearable for Steven. Only by seeing them could Steven feel the hope of breaking through all obstacles.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:34] Balbec Restaurant | I thought that if Steven had not seen them, the fury that would follow this hope would be overwhelming.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:39] Balbec Restaurant | I thought of such moments, when, in Steven's mind, these girls overshadowed the David.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:44] Balbec Restaurant | At that moment, if I mentioned going somewhere, they would be there, and Steven would immediately run off happily. I thought that when Steven imagined he was thinking about something else, or thinking about nothing at all, his mind was actually happily and entirely occupied with them.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:49] Restaurant Balbec | I thought that when Steven, even without being aware of it, thought of them more unconsciously, they were for Steven the undulating blue waves of the sea, the silhouettes passing in line along the shore.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:54] Restaurant Balbec | I thought that if Steven went to the city where they were, Steven would certainly want to reunite with the sea, for the most exclusive love a person can feel is always for an object.\n[1897-08-08 09:41:59] Balbec | I thought of Steven, who was now very interested in golf and tennis, and who had missed the chance to watch an artist—David knew he was one of the greatest artists—painting and listening to him go on at length.\n[1897-08-08 09:42:04] Balbec | I thought that David looked down on Steven, and Steven believed this disdain came from certain narrow-minded views.\n[1897-08-08 09:42:09] Balbec | I thought of how Steven had once observed on the Champs-Élysées, and from that time on, Steven himself had become more aware that when Stevenes are infatuated with a woman, they are merely projecting their own mental state onto her.\n[1897-08-08 09:42:14] Balbec | I thought that therefore, the important thing was not the value of this woman, but the depth of one's state of mind.\n[1897-08-08 09:42:19] Balbec | I thought of an ordinary young girl, whose passion for Steven could bring to his consciousness the most hidden, personal, remote, and fundamental parts of his own soul.\n[1897-08-08 09:42:24] Balbec | I thought of the pleasure that a conversation with an extraordinary person, or even the reverent contemplation of his work, could bring to Stevenes, yet it failed to produce such an effect.\n[1897-08-11 21:22:14] Balbec | I saw Steven finally give in to David.\n[1897-08-11 21:22:24] Balbec | I saw a tram passing along Beach Street, and the heat of the day forced Steven to take the tram. What troubled Steven even more was that George was living on the newest street in Riverside, quite far from the beach.\n[1897-08-11 21:22:29] Balbec Street | I saw that Steven was trying hard not to look at the buildings that stretched out before him, which were clumsily luxurious, in order to imagine that Steven was in the ancient kingdom of Simerian, in the realm of King Mark, or among the ruins of the Borosland forest.\n[1897-08-11 21:59:14] Outside Elstir's villa | I thought George's villa was the ugliest yet most luxurious of all the buildings.\n[1897-08-11 21:59:29] Outside Elstir's Villa | I knew he still rented it, because among the remaining villas in Riverside, only this one offered a large studio.\n[1897-08-11 22:23:54] Elstir's Studio Garden | When I saw Steven crossing the garden, his eyes were also looking elsewhere.\n[1897-08-11 22:24:04] Elstir's Studio Garden | I saw a patch of grass in the garden, like the kind any bourgeois person in the suburbs of Willowbrook would have in their house, but smaller.\n[1897-08-11 22:24:19] Elstir's Studio Garden | What I saw that entered Steven's eyes was a small statue of a dashing gardener, from which one could admire a glass ball, with begonias as an edging, and a tiny pavilion (beneath which, at a metal table, several wicker chairs were arranged).\n[1897-08-11 23:00:53] The studio of Elstir | I thought that after coming into contact with these ugly urban things, when Steven entered the studio, he would no longer pay attention to the chocolate-colored stripes on the paneling covering the seams.\n[1897-08-11 23:00:58] The studio of Elstir | I thought of Steven, and I was happy because, through all the works surrounding Steven, Steven felt that it was possible for his emotions to be elevated into a poetic awareness filled with joy, in various forms.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:03] The studio of Elstir | I thought that up until then, Steven had not yet separated these works from the entire situation in reality.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:08] The studio of Elstir | I thought of George's studio, which in Steven's eyes was like some kind of innovative laboratory in the world.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw that, from the jumble of things that Steven had encountered, he extracted the crashing waves of the sea that crushed his lilac-colored foam on the beach, and from somewhere else, a young man in a white piqué jacket, his elbows resting on the ship's deck.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:28] The studio of Elstir | I saw him painting them on various rectangular canvases, which were scattered there in all directions.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:38] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the young man's jacket and the splashing waves, even though they had lost the content that people once believed they contained. The waves could no longer splash, and the jacket could no longer be worn by anyone, yet they continued to exist, and in that continuation, they acquired a new dignity.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:43] The studio of Elstir | When I saw Steven enter, the master of creation was still holding his brush, completing the shape of the sunset.\n[1897-08-11 23:01:53] The studio of Elstir | I saw that the shutters on all sides were almost completely closed, and the studio was quite cool, except for one spot where strong sunlight left a vivid and fleeting decoration on the dark wall — only a small rectangular window was open.\n[1897-08-11 23:02:08] The studio of Elstir | I saw the small window surrounded by honeysuckle, facing a main street, and below it was a corner of the garden.\n[1897-08-11 23:02:23] The studio of Elstir | I saw that the studio was mostly dim and lifeless, the air transparent and forming a solid mass, but in the cracks where the sunlight was embedded, it was both damp and dull yet sparkling, like a large piece of crystal rock, one side of which had been carved and smoothed, and here and there it shimmered like a mirror, casting a spectrum of colors.\n[1897-08-11 23:02:38] The studio of Elstir | I saw, at Steven's request, George continued painting, while Steven moved about in the half-light, pausing for a while in front of this painting and then for a while in front of another.\n[1897-08-11 23:02:48] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven looking around at all the paintings, which were all his own. I thought that Steven considered most of them not to be the sort he had hoped to see.\n[1897-08-11 23:02:53] The studio of Elstir | I knew these paintings, as an English art magazine left on the table in the big hotel said, belonged to his first and second styles, that is, mythological painting and the style influenced by Japan.\n[1897-08-11 23:03:13] The studio of Elstir | I know that it is said that both of these styles are beautifully represented in Edward's collection.\n[1897-08-11 23:03:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw, of course, that the works in his studio were almost all painted here, in Riverside, from seascapes.\n[1897-08-11 23:03:48] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, but Steven could still discern that the charm of each scene lay in the fact that the thing it portrayed had undergone some change, similar to what is called a metaphor in poetry.\n[1897-08-11 23:03:53] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if God the James had created everything and given each thing a name, then George had recreated them, stripping them of their names or giving them another.\n[1897-08-11 23:03:58] The studio of Elstir | I thought of how the names of things always correspond to a certain concept in the mind, and since this concept was utterly incompatible with Steven's true impressions, Steven had no choice but to exclude everything unrelated to this concept from the thing itself.\n[1897-08-11 23:04:03] The studio of Elstir | I know that in the morning at the Riverside hotel, when Françoise removed the blanket that blocked the sunlight, and in the evening, when Steven stood by the window waiting for the moment when he would go out with Peter.\n[1897-08-11 23:04:23] The studio of Elstir | I thought that because of the play of light, sometimes Steven mistook the darker part of the sea for a distant shore, or gazed with delight at the blue expanse, not knowing whether it was sea or sky.\n[1897-08-11 23:04:28] The studio of Elstir | I thought that soon Steven's reason would once again separate the elements, while Steven's impression would cancel that distinction once more.\n[1897-08-11 23:04:33] The studio of Elstir | I know it was the same in Willowbrook; sometimes Steven would hear an argument, almost a commotion, in his own room, and wouldn't connect the sound with its cause until, for example, a carriage drew up nearby.\n[1897-08-11 23:04:53] The studio of Elstir | I thought only Steven could exclude the sharp, grating scolding from that sound, even though Steven's ears had indeed heard the sharp, grating scolding, and Steven's reason knew that the wheels could not produce such a sound.\n[1897-08-11 23:04:58] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the moments when people truly see nature poetically are rare, and George's work is made up precisely of such moments.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:03] The studio of Elstir | I saw, among the sea views that surrounded him at this moment, that Steven's most common comparison was the contrast between the sea and the sky, with any boundary between them abolished.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:18] The studio of Elstir | I realized that it was precisely through this unspoken, tireless repetition of the contrast in the same painting that he introduced a high degree of harmony in various forms.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:23] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the reason George's paintings aroused such fervent responses in certain enthusiasts was precisely this, though sometimes these people themselves failed to recognize it clearly.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:28] The studio of Elstir | I watched Steven gaze at the painting for a long time. I saw that he had just finished a painting in the past few days, a painting depicting the harbor of Unknown_Carquethuit.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:38] The studio of Elstir | I thought that in this painting, George had already prepared the viewer for this kind of comparison; he used only maritime vocabulary to descri be the small town, and only urban vocabulary to descri be the sea.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:43] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven seeing either the houses blocking part of the harbor, or the patched-up ponds, or even the sea extending inland as a bay, which was a common occurrence in the area of Riverside.\n[1897-08-11 23:05:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw masts rising from the forward-pointing tip of the city, just as chimneys or church towers might appear on a roof, as if the roofs themselves had become part of ships, forming the hulls of vessels.\n[1897-08-11 23:06:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw other boats moored along the seawall, which only strengthened this impression. I thought, but this also has a city character, it was built on land.\n[1897-08-11 23:06:18] The studio of Elstir | I saw the boats so closely packed together that one could stand on one and chat with people on another, unable to tell them apart or even distinguish the small gaps between them.\n[1897-08-11 23:06:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw the church of Saint-Cricq, which appeared to be surrounded by water from a distance, because the city itself was invisible. I thought that the fishing fleet was less belonging to the sea than the church at Criques-Bec.\n[1897-08-11 23:06:38] The studio of Elstir | I saw the church rising from the water like a shell, as if made of white stone or foam, tied to a poetic rainbow belt, forming an unreal and mysterious picture amid the sunlight and waves, which seemed like swirling dust.\n[1897-08-11 23:06:53] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the painter's way of making people's eyes accustomed to the indistinct boundary between land and sea, the absolute line of separation.\n[1897-08-11 23:06:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw several strong men pushing the boats into the sea, running both in the waves and on the sand.\n[1897-08-11 23:07:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw the sand become wet, as if turned into water, reflecting the hull of the boat.\n[1897-08-11 23:07:28] The studio of Elstir | I saw that the sea did not rise evenly, but rather overflowed along the curve of the coastline.\n[1897-08-11 23:07:43] The studio of Elstir | I saw the distant view tearing the sandy shore into threads, a ship sailing on the vast sea, half hidden by the nearly completed naval shipyard, as if it were sailing through a city.\n[1897-08-11 23:07:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw women gathering sea shrimp among the rocks. Because everything around them was water, and because they were behind the fortress of rocks, which was lower in elevation, the beach (at the two ends closest to the land) had dropped to sea level, making them seem as if they were inside a cave beneath the sea.\n[1897-08-11 23:08:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw the cave in the sea, its upper part extending toward the ships and waves, yet it had been carved out and protected amid the miraculously parted surging tides.\n[1897-08-11 23:08:28] The studio of Elstir | I thought that although the entire scene gave the impression of the harbor as if the sea had entered the land, making the land have the nature of the sea, and people had become amphibians, the power of the marine element still burst forth everywhere.",

    "text": "[1897-08-11 23:08:33] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the place at the entrance of the breakwater, by the rocks, where the sea was noisy. From the sailors' toil, from the ships tilted at sharp angles lying against the high docks, churches, and houses in the city, some people returned to the city while others went out to fish from it. Steven felt their hard work on the water, as if they were riding horses.\n[1897-08-11 23:08:38] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the horse, which was fierce and swift, but if they weren't alert and nimble, the animal would throw them to the ground with a shake of its body.\n[1897-08-11 23:08:43] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven watching a group of tourists happily taking a small boat out to sea; the little boat swayed unsteadily, like an inferior carriage.\n[1897-08-11 23:08:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw a sailor, naturally cheerful yet completely absorbed, steering his boat as if guiding a horse with reins, his strong sails billowing.\n[1897-08-11 23:09:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw each tourist sitting quietly in their own seat, avoiding the risk of the boat tipping over due to excessive weight on one side.\n[1897-08-11 23:09:28] The studio of Elstir | I thought of how, in the sunlit fields and under the green shade of scenic spots, people also ran and tumbled down the hills like that.\n[1897-08-11 23:09:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw that although it had rained heavily, the morning was still bright and clear.\n[1897-08-11 23:09:48] The studio of Elstir | I thought of how even the still ship could feel the sun and shade, and how much powerful resistance had to be subdued in those parts of the sea where it was so calm and peaceful!\n[1897-08-11 23:09:53] The studio of Elstir | I saw the sea so calm. I thought that the reflection in the water seemed more solid and real than the ship's hull, which appeared to have already evaporated due to the sun's effect.\n[1897-08-11 23:09:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw the distant view making the ship's hull look like a row of scales.\n[1897-08-11 23:10:13] The studio of Elstir | I thought, or rather, the Stevenes had not yet mentioned the other parts of the sea, which differed greatly from each other, just as one part differed from the church that emerged from the water and the ships behind the city.\n[1897-08-11 23:10:18] The studio of Elstir | I saw the storm here, pitch black; a bit farther away, the colors were vivid, and like the sky, glazed with a glossy sheen.\n[1897-08-11 23:10:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw over there, where the sunlight, mist, and foam made the sea so white, so unbroken, so full of the scent of earth, so full of the illusion of houses. I thought that people might even believe it was a stone path or a plain of snow.\n[1897-08-11 23:10:38] The studio of Elstir | I saw, but Steven saw a boat on the stone path or snowy plain. I was startled at the thought of Steven.\n[1897-08-11 23:10:43] The studio of Elstir | I saw the boats suspended on the steep slope, resting on dry land, like a carriage that had just emerged from a crossing and was now drying.\n[1897-08-11 23:10:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw, but a moment later, people again saw some wobbly boats on the vast, uneven surface of this solid plateau. I thought that it was only then that people finally realized it was still the sea, and that all these sights were real.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:03] The studio of Elstir | I thought about what people say, that there is no progress or discovery in art, only in science; each artist must start over again on his own, for the strength of anyone else can neither help him nor hinder him.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:08] The studio of Elstir | I thought that although this was not without reason, one still had to admit that within the realm where art reveals certain laws, once a particular technique has made these laws widespread, the earlier art loses some of its novelty and originality.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:13] The studio of Elstir | I knew that since George had started painting, the Stevenes had already gone through the \"exciting\" phase of photographing natural scenery and cities.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:33] The studio of Elstir | I wondered what exactly the amateur enthusiasts meant by this adjective in such a situation. To explain clearly, Steven would see that this adjective is generally used to descri be the strange appearance of a familiar thing.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:38] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this image, which was different from the usual ones that Steven was familiar with—strange yet real—therefore especially fascinating to Steven, because it astonished Steven, led him out of routine, and at the same time brought him back to himself by evoking a certain impression.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:43] The studio of Elstir | I thought, for example, of a single frame from these \"excellent\" photographs, which illustrated a regularity of the distant view. To Steven and others, it showed a cathedral that was commonplace in their city, but it was shot from a carefully chosen vantage point.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:48] The studio of Elstir | I thought that from that point, it seemed thirty times taller than the house, and jutted out at a sharp angle from the river, although in reality it was very far away from the river.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:53] The studio of Elstir | I thought that George didn't work by simply reproducing things as they were--he knew what they were--but by presenting them according to the optical illusions on which Steven's original vision was based.\n[1897-08-11 23:11:58] The studio of Elstir | I thought that this kind of effort was precisely what he needed to explain certain general laws of the distant, which was even more astonishing, because it was art that first revealed these laws.\n[1897-08-11 23:12:03] The studio of Elstir | I thought of a river, whose winding course made a bay, which, because it appeared to be close to the cliff, seemed like a lake completely enclosed on all sides, as if dug out from the plains or mountains.\n[1897-08-11 23:12:08] The studio of Elstir | I saw a painting, taken from Riverside, depicting a summer day with a blazing sun, in which a section of the sea, enclosed by pink granite cliffs, seemed not like the sea at all, but the sea began only from a slightly farther distance.\n[1897-08-11 23:12:23] The studio of Elstir | I saw the continuity of the ocean only hinted at by some gulls, which circled above what seemed to be stones, drinking in the damp air of the waves.\n[1897-08-11 23:12:38] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this same painting, which also revealed other patterns.\n[1897-08-11 23:12:43] The studio of Elstir | I saw, for example, small white sails reflected in the blue mirror of the sea beneath the towering cliffs, like butterflies deeply asleep, displaying the utmost delicacy of size; or again, certain shadows in sharp contrast with the brightness of light.\n[1897-08-11 23:12:58] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the art of composition had made the infinite variations of shadow well known, yet George was so interested in the infinite variations of shadow that, before, he had devoted himself wholeheartedly to painting real mirages.\n[1897-08-11 23:13:03] The studio of Elstir | I saw a castle in the mirage, its top crowned with a tower, appearing as a completely circular old castle, with a tower extending upward from the top and another tower pointing downward at the bottom.\n[1897-08-11 23:13:18] The studio of Elstir | I thought it might be because the sky was especially clear, giving the reflection in the water a stony hardness and luster, or perhaps because the morning mist made the stones and their reflections equally hazy.\n[1897-08-11 23:13:23] The studio of Elstir | I saw, just the same, far away, beyond the sea, behind a row of distant trees, another sea began, painted by the setting sun in shades of rose, and this was the sky.\n[1897-08-11 23:13:38] The studio of Elstir | I saw the sunlight, as if a new solid had been created, pushing against the ship it directly illuminated, while the other ship behind was shrouded in shadow, like a crystal staircase with each step placed on a surface.\n[1897-08-11 23:13:53] The studio of Elstir | I saw that, in terms of its material composition, the surface was flat, but the light of the morning sea broke through this surface.\n[1897-08-11 23:13:58] The studio of Elstir | I saw a river flowing under a bridge of a city, and from such a viewpoint, the river seemed completely broken up—here it was arranged like a lake, there it was as thin as a web, and elsewhere it was fractured by the insertion of a small hill covered with trees.\n[1897-08-11 23:14:13] The studio of Elstir | I knew that the residents of the town came up to the woods on the hill at night to breathe in the cool evening air.\n[1897-08-11 23:14:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw this turbulent city, whose rhythm was expressed only by the unyielding verticality of the bell tower.\n[1897-08-11 23:14:48] The studio of Elstir | I saw the clock tower not reaching toward the sky, but rather, through heavy straight lines, indicating the rhythm of life, like in a triumphal march, as if it were suspending, beneath its own body, the entire vast area of buildings shrouded in mist, which seemed even more blurred, along the broken, crushed river. I know that George's earliest works originated in an era when a single figure was used to enliven a landscape painting.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:03] The studio of Elstir | I thought about the roads on cliffs or in the mountains, that part of the natural scenery which has a human quality, and how they, like rivers or the sea, are eroded by the distant view.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:08] The studio of Elstir | I thought of mountain peaks, or the mist of waterfalls, or the sea, which make it impossible to keep moving forward along the path that is visible to travelers, but not to Steven.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw the little figure dressed in outdated clothing, lost in this desolate solitude, seeming to often stop before the abyss, and here the winding path he followed had come to an end.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:28] The studio of Elstir | I saw, and higher up three hundred meters in the pine forest, the Stevenes saw the welcoming sandy path, a white, fine line reappearing under the travelers' feet. I thought it was just what would reassure Steven, and my eyes were moved as well.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw the hills surrounding the waterfall or the bay, hiding the winding bends in the middle of the path from the Stevenes.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:38] The studio of Elstir | I thought it was remarkable that George had managed to strip away all intellectual concepts before the reality.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:43] The studio of Elstir | I thought of how, especially, he would make himself completely ignorant before painting, forgetting everything out of integrity (for the things people know do not truly belong to them), and this was precisely the wisdom of a highly cultivated mind.\n[1897-08-11 23:15:48] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven admit, as he stood in front of the church at Riverside, that he was disappointed. I heard him say to Steven, \"Well, did the gate disappoint you? This is the most beautiful Bible, historically transformed, that the people will never understand!\"\n[1897-08-11 23:15:53] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"The Madonna and all the reliefs depicting her life are the most beautiful and poetic expression of the long medieval hymn of praise dedicated to the Virgin.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:15:58] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"Besides accurately and meticulously depicting the Bible, what lofty discoveries did the aged sculptor make, how profound his reflections, and what beautiful poetry did he infuse into it!\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:03] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"The angels carrying the shroud that wraps the Virgin's body—so sacred, they dare not touch it directly. What a magnificent idea!\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:08] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven tell him that he had also studied this subject at the Church of Saint-André. I had heard that he had seen a photo of the gates of Saint Andrew's Church, but he pointed to Steven and said, \"Those little peasants, all running around the Virgin at the same time, are nothing like the two almost Italian-style slender, gentle archangels here.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:13] The studio of Elstir | I heard him continue: \"The angel who took the soul of the Virgin so that it might unite with her body; the moment when Elizabeth touched Mary's breast upon their meeting and was astonished by the swelling of her breast; the midwife who refused to believe in the Immaculate Conception until she had touched the arm wrapped in the swaddling clothes;\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:18] The studio of Elstir | I heard about the girdle that the Virgin threw to Saint Thomas to prove she had risen from the dead, and about the fine linen she tore from her breast to cover her son's naked body—the blood collected by the Church on his side, which was the drink of the Eucharist.\n[1897-08-11 23:16:23] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"On the other side, there is a hall where rule has ended, blindfolded, holding a scepter broken in half, the crown falling from its head, while the laws of the previous reign lie scattered on the ground;\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:28] The studio of Elstir | \"I don't you think it's quite a clever idea, the idea of a husband helping his young wife out of the grave at the Last Judgment, placing her hand on her own chest to reassure her and prove that her heart is indeed still beating?\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:33] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"And what about the angel who took away the sun and the moon? If the light of the cross is seven times brighter than that of the stars, then the sun and the moon are utterly useless!\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:38] The studio of Elstir | \"I heard about the angel who dipped his hand in the baptismal water of Jesus to see if it was hot enough; the angel who descended from the clouds to place a wreath on the Virgin's forehead; and all the angels who leaned over the balustrades of the heavenly Jerusalem temple, seeing the wicked suffer and the good prosper, raising their arms either out of fear or joy!\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:43] The studio of Elstir | \"I heard, 'What you are seeing here are the various groups in heaven, the entire great poetic work of theology and symbolism! It's simply absurd, simply amazing, a thousand times better than everything you'll see in Italy!\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:48] The studio of Elstir | I heard \"Besides, the triangular pediment of Italy was a work of a sculptor whose genius was greatly inferior, who copied it verbatim.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:53] The studio of Elstir | I heard him say, \"You must understand, all these things are nothing but a question of genius. There has never been an age when everyone was a genius. That's all nonsense, and it's even worse than the Golden Age.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:16:58] The studio of Elstir | \"I heard him say, 'A guy who carved such a façade—please be sure, he's also very talented. His thoughts are just as deep as those people you admire the most now.'\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:03] The studio of Elstir | \"I heard, 'If the Marceaux went to Italy, Steven would show you these things; certain parts of the religious ceremony for the Assumption of the Virgin are very skillfully expressed here, even Léon could not match it.'\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:08] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the vast celestial realm and the immense theological poem that he had spoken to Steven about, and now Steven finally understood how it had been composed. At first, when Steven had opened his eyes full of longing at the front door, he had not seen these things.",

    "text": "[1897-08-11 23:17:13] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven talking to him about the tall statues of saints, standing on high pedestals, as if forming a great avenue. I heard him say to Steven, \"This great road began in ancient times and finally reached Jesus Christ.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:18] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"On one side are the spiritual ancestors of Jesus, on the other the King of Judah, the physical ancestor of Jesus. Every century is concentrated here.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:23] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"The thing you take as a pedestal, if you look more carefully, you can call out the name of the person crouching above it.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:28] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"Because beneath Moses, you will recognize the golden calf; beneath Abraham, you will recognize the lamb; beneath Joseph, you will recognize the demon who advised Potiphar's wife.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:33] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven say to him that Steven had expected to see a building that was almost Persian in style. I thought this was probably one of the reasons Steven felt disappointed.\n[1897-08-11 23:17:38] The studio of Elstir | I heard him answer Steven: \"No, no, there are many true things, some parts are entirely Eastern.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:43] The studio of Elstir | I heard someone say, \"There is a column that accurately reproduces a Persian theme, and the omnipresence of Eastern legends cannot explain this phenomenon; the sculptor must have copied something brought back by sailors from the East.\"\n[1897-08-11 23:17:48] The studio of Elstir | I saw that he showed Steven a photo of a column. I saw Steven seeing, from the column, almost Chinese-style dragons devouring each other.\n[1897-08-11 23:17:58] The studio of Elstir | I thought of it, but in Riverside, this small carving passed unnoticed by Steven, as part of the overall architecture, which did not resemble the scene that the words \"almost Persian-style church\" had revealed to Steven.\n[1897-08-11 23:18:03] The studio of Elstir | I felt the warmth of the transparent varnish, the flickering half-light of the room, the continuous heat of the sun-baked street outside the small window surrounded by ivy, which carried the full scent of the countryside. I thought that, although Steven experienced a kind of spiritual happiness in this studio, it did nothing to stop Steven from feeling that everything was surrounding him, and that Steven and his kind could no longer act on their own.\n[1897-08-11 23:18:08] The studio of Elstir | I saw that only the shade of the distant trees veiled the sun. I thought of the painting \"Unknown_Carquethuit Harbor\" and how it would make Steven very happy.\n[1897-08-11 23:18:13] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the unconscious comfort this summer brought to Steven, which might have expanded his happiness like a tributary widening a river.\n[1897-08-12 23:28:37] The studio of Elstir | I noticed that in a sentence expressing gratitude, Steven used the word \"honor.\" I saw Steven's face slightly altered by sorrow.\n[1897-08-12 23:28:47] The studio of Elstir | I thought that Steven had originally believed George was modest, but now Steven realized he had made a terrible mistake.\n[1897-08-12 23:28:52] The studio of Elstir | I thought of those who believe their work will endure forever—George was in this category—people accustomed to placing their works in an era when they themselves had long turned to dust.\n[1897-08-12 23:28:57] The studio of Elstir | I thought, the concept of \"honor\" forced them to reflect on this empty world, causing them sorrow because the concept was inextricably linked with that of death.\n[1897-08-12 23:29:02] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven quickly change the subject to dispel the cloud. I thought of how the thoughtless, unintentional act had raised this proud and melancholy cloud over George's brow.\n[1897-08-12 23:29:07] The studio of Elstir | I heard Steven say to him, \"They advised Steven not to go to England, saying it's bad for a mind already prone to fantasy.\" I thought of Steven and of the conversation I had once with Thomas in Sunrise, and I hoped to learn his views on that very discussion.\n[1897-08-12 23:29:12] The studio of Elstir | I heard him answer Steven: \"No! When a person's mind is already inclined toward fantasy, it shouldn't be taken away from its dreams, shouldn't be restricted.\"\n[1897-08-12 23:29:17] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"Once you take your mind away from dreams, your mind will never again understand its own dreams. You will be deceived by a hundred appearances, because you have not understood the essence of those appearances.\"\n[1897-08-12 23:29:22] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"If a little fantasy is dangerous, then the cure for this illness is not less fantasy, but more fantasy, becoming entirely immersed in fantasy.\"\n[1897-08-12 23:29:27] The studio of Elstir | I heard, \"It is important to fully understand one's own fantasies in order not to suffer from them anymore.\"\n[1897-08-12 23:29:32] The studio of Elstir | I heard that it was beneficial to keep fantasy and life properly separated, to the point where Steven began to wonder if he shouldn't, like some surgeons who advocated removing all children's appendixes in order to prevent appendicitis later on, take a preventive step and separate fantasy from life at an early stage.\n[1897-08-13 01:56:31] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw George and Steven walk all the way to the end of the painting room and stand by the window. I saw the window behind the garden, facing a narrow side street that was almost a country path.\n[1897-08-13 01:56:41] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw Steven and his friends come here to breathe in the fresh air of late afternoon.\n[1897-08-13 01:56:51] The window of Elstir's studio | I thought that Steven, feeling himself so far away from that small group of girls, had finally made up his mind to sacrifice the hope of seeing them, which is why he at last agreed to visit George at David's request.\n[1897-08-13 01:56:56] The window of Elstir's studio | I thought of where the thing you're searching for is, something you don't know about, and which you often avoid for other reasons, the very place where everyone asks Steven to go, but the Stevenes don't expect that it's precisely here that they will see the person they've been longing for day and night.\n[1897-08-13 01:57:01] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw Steven staring aimlessly down this country road. I saw the path running close to the studio, but it no longer belonged to George.\n[1897-08-13 01:57:11] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw, suddenly, a small group of people, and among them was the girl pushing a bicycle.\n[1897-08-13 01:57:26] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw Steven seeing her hurry along the path, her jet-black hair crowned with her polo cap, which was pulled low, revealing her full cheeks and her lively, yet stubborn eyes.\n[1897-08-13 01:57:41] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw Steven seeing her send a friendly greeting to George from under the tree, along this miraculously lucky and tenderly promising path.\n[1897-08-13 01:57:51] The window of Elstir's studio | I thought it was like a rainbow, connecting Steven's world with a region that Steven and his kind had always considered unattainable.\n[1897-08-13 01:57:56] The window of Elstir's studio | I saw her even come over and offer her hand to the painter, but she didn't stop walking. I saw Steven notice a beauty mark on her chin.\n[1897-08-13 01:58:06] The window of Elstir's studio | I heard Steven ask George, \"Sir, do you know this girl?\" I thought that Steven must have understood that he had introduced Steven to her and asked her to come to his house.",

    "text": "[1897-08-13 01:58:11] The studio of Elstir | I saw the quiet studio surrounded by countryside scenery, which was filled with an even deeper layer of poetry. I thought of a situation like a child who is already very happy in a house, and then learns that beautiful things and noble people are extremely generous, about to endlessly increase their gifts, preparing a sumptuous tea for him.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:16] The studio of Elstir | I heard George tell Steven that her name was Albertine Simonet, and she also listed the names of her other girlfriends.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought Steven described these girls quite accurately, so he spoke their names without hesitation.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought about their social status, and Steven was wrong, but this kind of mistake was not of the same type as the usual errors in judgment one makes at Riverside.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the shopkeeper's son riding on horseback, and Steven had easily taken them for princes, but this time, Steven had placed some young women from fairly wealthy bourgeois and business families into a suspicious class.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought about the issue of social class, which Steven had the least interest in at first.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:41] The studio of Elstir | I thought that to Steven, neither the lower classes nor the upper society of the Fairhaven had any mystery.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if the colorful emptiness of seaside life had not already endowed them with some charm before Steven's dazzled eyes, and if they would never lose this charm, then Steven probably would not have fought so successfully against the idea of their being daughters of large-scale merchants.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:51] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, at this point, Steven could only admire the French bourgeoisie as an exquisite and most diverse sculptor's workshop.\n[1897-08-13 04:12:56] The studio of Elstir | How many unexpected types I thought of! What a remarkable invention the facial features were! What decisiveness, what freshness, what simplicity in the lines of the face!\n[1897-08-13 04:13:01] The studio of Elstir | I thought it was incredible that these Diana and nymphs had come from the stingy old bourgeois class, and Steven really found these old bourgeois to be the most magnificent statues.\n[1897-08-13 04:13:06] The studio of Elstir | I thought about the changing social status of these girls, and before Steven even noticed, another idea had already taken root behind their vulgar faces.\n[1897-08-13 04:13:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought that originally Steven had considered them mistresses of bicycle athletes or boxing champions, but now I felt they were probably very closely connected with some lawyer's family that Steven knew.\n[1897-08-13 04:13:16] The studio of Elstir | I thought of these discoveries, and how they could completely alter a person's views with the instantaneous chemical reaction of a revelation!\n[1897-08-13 04:13:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought about what kind of person Albertine Simonin was, of whom Steven knew very little, and surely she had no idea how she would be to Steven on a particular day.\n[1897-08-13 04:13:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought about the name Simone, which Steven had already heard about on the beach. If someone had told Steven to write it, he might have written two \"n\"s, never imagining that this family placed such importance on having only one \"n\".\n[1897-08-13 04:13:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, the lower one went on the social ladder, the more one clung to trivial fashions. These trivial matters might not be any less meaningless than the symbols of nobility, but they were more absurd, more arbitrary, and more astonishing.\n[1897-08-13 04:13:36] The studio of Elstir | I know there may have been people named Simonnet who did bad things, even worse than this. In any case, it is said that if someone writes their surname with two \"n\"s, the members of the Simonnet family become extremely angry, as if they had been slandered.\n[1897-08-13 04:13:56] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the family of Montmorency, who took pride in being among the earliest barons of France, and probably felt the same pride in having the name Simeon with only one \"n,\" rather than two.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:01] The studio of Elstir | I heard Steven ask George whether the girls lived in Riverside.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:06] The studio of Elstir | I heard him answer Steven that some of the girls lived in Riverside.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:11] The studio of Elstir | I knew there was a girl's villa at the end of the beach, where the cliffs of Canaillers began.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought that because this girl was a close friend of Albertine Simonet, Steven had even more reason to believe that the girl he had met with his grandmother was indeed Albertine Simonet.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought, of course, that there were so many small streets running perpendicular to the beach, and they all looked so similar at their corners that Steven could not possibly have accurately identified which one it was.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:41] The studio of Elstir | I thought that people wished for memory to be accurate, but at that very moment, the vision was blurred.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, in fact, the girl who entered her girlfriend's house was actually the same person as Albertine.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:51] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, despite this, the countless images of the brown-haired golfer that appeared before Steven, no matter how different each image was from the others, all overlapped with one another.\n[1897-08-13 04:14:56] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if Steven followed the thread of memory, he could pass by all these images under this guise, like in an inner corridor, without being able to emerge from the same person.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:01] The studio of Elstir | I thought to myself that, if Steven wanted to go back all the way to the day when he had met the girl on the road with his grandmother, Steven would have to go back out into the open again.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:06] The studio of Elstir | I thought that Steven was certain he had found Albertine again, the one who walked between her girlfriends, often stopping during their stroll, the one who was higher than the sea level—that was the same person.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought, but all the above images remained separated from the original one, because Steven could not, in retrospect, endow her with qualities that she did not possess at the moment when she left a deep impression on Steven's eyes.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:16] The studio of Elstir | I thought that no matter what probability calculations could offer Steven, the plump-cheeked girl who had boldly looked at Steven around the corner of the small street and the beach, whom Steven thought might fall in love with Steven, was someone Steven had never met again.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought of Steven hesitating between the various girls in this little group, each of whom retained a bit of the collective charm that had first captivated him.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:26] The studio of Elstir | I wondered whether this hesitation added yet another reason to the previous ones, granting Steven, even during his most passionate love for Albertine—the second time he had fallen in love—a kind of intermittent and brief freedom from loving her?\n[1897-08-13 04:15:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought that because he first wandered among all her girlfriends before finally settling on her, Steven's love sometimes retained a certain \"game-like\" quality between love and the image of Albertine.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this game, like a beam of light that didn't aim properly, which first fell on someone else and then returned to her.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:41] The studio of Elstir | I thought that there seemed to be no necessary connection between Steven's sense of unease and his memories of Albertine, and perhaps it could just as easily be linked to the image of someone else.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this idea in a flash, which enabled Steven to render reality into nothingness—not just the external reality, such as Steven's love for Albertine, but even the purely subjective reality of the inner self.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:51] The studio of Elstir | I thought of Steven, who acknowledged that his love for Albertine was a state of mind in which he drew entirely from his own heart the unique qualities and particular character of the person he loved, making love an indispensable part of Steven's happiness.\n[1897-08-13 04:15:56] The studio of Elstir | I heard George say to Steven, \"There is no day when one or the other of them doesn't pass by the studio and come in for a brief visit.\"\n[1897-08-13 04:16:01] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if David had called Steven to come see her, he would have come right away, and it was likely that Steven had already met Albertine.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:06] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this, and George's words truly hurt Steven.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:11] The studio of Elstir | I saw her walking away. I could no longer see her from the studio.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought to myself, Steven, she's gone to the sea wall to meet her girlfriends.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if Steven had gone to the sea wall with George earlier, he would have met them too.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:31] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven come up with a hundred excuses to get him to agree to go for a walk on the beach with Steven.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought that before the girl appeared in the frame of that small window, Steven's heart had been at peace, but now Steven had lost that peace.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:41] The studio of Elstir | I saw that small window, which had been so moving, enclosed by the jasmine up until then, but now it seemed empty and desolate.\n[1897-08-13 04:16:56] The studio of Elstir | I heard George tell Steven that he wanted to walk a bit with him, but he had to finish the painting he was working on first. I thought of this which made Steven happy, a happiness mixed with torment.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:01] The studio of Elstir | I saw that he was painting flowers, but not crabapple blossoms, rose hips, cornflowers, or apple blossoms. I thought that if Steven were to commission a painting, he would prefer a painting of these flowers rather than a portrait, so that through his genius, the thing that Steven had been searching for in front of these flowers but had never been able to find might be revealed.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:06] The studio of Elstir | I saw George painting while talking about plants with Steven, but Steven wasn't listening. I realized that just him alone was no longer enough; he was now merely a necessary intermediary between those girls and Steven.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought about his prestige, which not long ago had been conferred upon Steven by his genius, but now had value only in the eyes of that small group of people he was about to introduce to Steven, through whom this prestige would be extended to Steven.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:16] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven pacing back and forth. I thought Steven was eager for him to finish quickly.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:21] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven grabbing some exercises and examining them closely. Many of the exercises were flipped over against the wall, stacked one on top of another.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:31] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven happen to come across a watercolor painting. I thought this painting was probably from an earlier period in George's career, a time that particularly fascinated Steven.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought of some works that were not only technically superb but also had such unusual and enticing themes, that the Stevenes could attribute part of the work's charm to the theme, as if this charm had already existed in a material form in nature, and the painter needed only to discover it, to observe it, and to copy it.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:41] The studio of Elstir | I found it satisfying that such objects could exist, and even apart from the painter's style, they were beautiful. This fulfilled the materialism innate to Steven's heart, which had later been undermined by reason, and served as a counterweight for the abstraction of aesthetics.\n[1897-08-13 04:17:46] The studio of Elstir | I saw this watercolor, a portrait of a young woman. She was not beautiful, but belonged to a unique type.\n[1897-08-13 04:18:01] The studio of Elstir | I saw her wearing a soft cap on her head, very similar to a melon-shaped hat with a cherry-red ribbon on the brim.\n[1897-08-13 04:18:16] The studio of Elstir | I saw two hands wearing open-fingered gloves, one holding a lit cigarette, the other raising something that looked like a large straw hat used solely for shading from the sun up to knee level.\n[1897-08-13 04:18:31] The studio of Elstir | I saw a table beside her, with a vase full of roses on it. I thought that the charm of such works lay precisely in the fact that they were created under specific conditions, which Stevens often fail to grasp at first, as is the case with this painting.\n[1897-08-13 04:18:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought, for example, that Steven and others didn't know whether the strange outfit of a female model was a costume for a masquerade ball or whether it was an old man wearing a red overcoat, who looked as if he had deliberately put it on to cater to the painter's eccentric fancy. But Steven and others didn't know whether it was his professor's robe, or a director's robe, or his bishop's stole.\n[1897-08-13 04:18:41] The studio of Elstir | I saw the portrait of Steven, and the character in the painting was unfathomable, because it was a former young actress, half-cross-dressed, leaving one puzzled.\n[1897-08-13 04:18:46] The studio of Elstir | I saw her short hair puffing up under the straw hat, her velvet jacket without a large collar, with a white stiff chest in the middle.\n[1897-08-13 04:19:01] The studio of Elstir | I wondered whether themelon cap and jacket were from a period that Steven could not immediately identify, and whether the model was male or female. In the end, all Steven could be certain of was that what he saw before him was the painter's most vibrant work.\n[1897-08-13 04:19:06] The studio of Elstir | I saw the sunlight through the small window had already begun to slope westward. I thought of the pleasure the painting had given Steven, disturbed now by his anxiety, for Steven was afraid that George would be slow again and that Steven would miss the girls.\n[1897-08-13 04:19:11] The studio of Elstir | I saw that in this watercolor, nothing could be simply confirmed and left at that; it had been painted because it belonged to the scene. I thought about clothing because the woman had to be dressed, and I painted the vase because there were flowers in it.\n[1897-08-13 04:19:16] The studio of Elstir | I found the glass vase itself endearing, as if it had been filled with water. The stems of the carnations inserted into the vase seemed to be immersed in a substance as clear and almost as liquid as water.\n[1897-08-13 04:19:31] The studio of Elstir | I saw the woman's attire enveloping her with a unique and yet familiar charm, as if industrial products could rival the miracles of the Creator. These miracles were as delicate as cat fur, carnation petals, and dove feathers, and they felt so sweet to the eye, painted with such vivid colors.",

    "text": "[1897-08-13 04:19:46] The studio of Elstir | I saw the stiff white chest, as fine as snowflakes, its delicate folds shaped like small bell-shaped flowers, just like the blossoms of a lily of the valley, opening in the bright refracted light of the room.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:01] The studio of Elstir | I saw that the refracted light itself was very strong, but just as a bouquet of flowers casts lace-like patterns on the sheet, this light was also slightly softened.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:16] The studio of Elstir | I saw the velvet of the jacket shimmering with a pearl-like luster; here and there something was standing up, something was torn, something was furry, evoking the image of scattered carnations in a vase.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought that what people especially felt was that George didn't care at all about the moral corruption implied by this costume and makeup for a young actress; to him, the kind of stimulation she might provide to the numb or already corrupted senses of certain spectators probably mattered more than her talent for playing her role.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, therefore, he focused all the more on these ambiguous characteristics, just as he would on a particular aesthetic element worth highlighting, which he would emphasize with all his effort.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:41] The studio of Elstir | I thought about following the lines of her face, and it seemed as though I had to admit she was a girl with a somewhat boyish appearance, but just then, that gender disappeared.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought back to the past, and it reappeared, but what it suggested was less the idea of a young man who was feminine, addicted to bad habits, and given to daydreams.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:51] The studio of Elstir | I thought that after that, sex had once again fled, always beyond my grasp.\n[1897-08-13 04:20:56] The studio of Elstir | I saw in his eyes that melancholy dreaminess, which stood in sharp contrast to the details of the decadent upper class and the theater world; this feature was not the least likely to stir one's emotions.\n[1897-08-13 04:21:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, in addition, people would think it was a disguise, and this young man, who seemed to be offering himself to be touched by the provocative nature of his outfit, probably found that adding some secret emotions kept within his heart, some romantic expressions of melancholy that were never revealed, would be more exciting.\n[1897-08-13 04:21:16] The studio of Elstir | I saw beneath the portrait: Miss Sacripant, October 1872.\n[1897-08-13 04:21:31] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven unable to refrain from applauding. I heard him say, \"Oh, it's nothing, just something hastily painted in my youth, for the costumes at a circus theater, long ago.\"\n[1897-08-13 04:21:36] The studio of Elstir | I saw Steven's words first make him start, then after a second, his face took on an expression of complete indifference and absent-mindedness. I heard, \"What happened to the model afterwards?\"\n[1897-08-13 04:21:41] The studio of Elstir | I saw him start at the sound of Madame George's footsteps. I heard him say to Steven, \"Hey, hurry up and give that painting to Steven, Mrs. George is here.\"\n[1897-08-13 04:21:46] The studio of Elstir | I heard him say, \"Although the young man in the melon hat played no role in Steven's life, Steven assures you, it's of no benefit for Steven's wife to see this watercolor. Steven keeps it only as a rather amusing piece of theater from that era.\"\n[1897-08-13 04:21:51] The studio of Elstir | I saw that George had probably not seen this watercolor for a long time; he looked at it for a moment, then hid it.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:01] The studio of Elstir | I heard him mutter to himself, \"Steven must have kept only the head; the lower part is drawn too badly, those hands are simply a merchant's hands.\"\n[1897-08-13 04:22:06] The studio of Elstir | I saw Madame George arrive, which would only delay Steven and the others. I felt truly sorry for Steven's heart.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:11] The studio of Elstir | I saw the edge of the window quickly turning rose-colored.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought that even if the Stevenes went out, they would probably achieve nothing.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought there was no longer any possibility of seeing those girls again, so whether or not Madame George left Steven and his group quickly or slowly no longer had any meaning.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought she hadn't stayed long, and Steven found her especially repulsive.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:41] The studio of Elstir | I see now, her black hair is turning white. I thought of her as twenty years younger, leading a cow through the countryside near Northgate, and she might have been a beautiful woman.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought of her as ordinary yet not simple and natural, for she considered dignified behavior and solemn demeanor essential to her sculptural beauty, and her age had already stripped that beauty of all its charm.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:51] The studio of Elstir | I heard George say, with respectful tenderness, \"Steven's beautiful Gabrielle!\" every single moment. I saw that her clothing was extremely simple.\n[1897-08-13 04:22:56] The studio of Elstir | I thought that saying these words would move him, fill him with respect, and when people heard him say them, they were deeply moved but also surprised.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:01] The studio of Elstir | I thought later, after Steven had seen George's mythological paintings, he also found that Madame George had gained a bit more beauty.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:06] The studio of Elstir | I realized that Steven had understood: since he had devoted all his time, his entire mental effort, in short, his whole life, to better distinguishing these lines and more faithfully reproducing them, he had in fact already attributed almost divine qualities to some ideal type, some standard.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought that this ideal type could be reduced to certain lines, certain Arabesque patterns that repeatedly appear in his work.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:16] The studio of Elstir | I thought of the kind of ideal that gave George inspiration, which was indeed so serious, so demanding a superstition, that this faith never allowed him to feel satisfied.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this ideal, which was the most secret part of his own heart, so he could not remain indifferent to it, nor could he find passion in it, until the day he encountered the ideal itself.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought of that day when he encountered, upon a girl's body, the very ideal that had already been realized externally—that was the body of the woman who later became Madame George.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought that from her, he was able to feel that the ideal was noble, touching, and miraculous--only for those who were not Steven himself, could Steven feel such things.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the beauty, which had to be painstakingly developed from within up until then, had suddenly, mysteriously taken flesh, offered itself to him willingly, in order to produce the fruitful result of an effective emotional unity.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:41] The studio of Elstir | I thought of pressing my lips to it, oh, what peace the soul would find!\n[1897-08-13 04:23:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought of George at that time, no longer in the youthful period when he had only to expect a vigorous mind to realize his ideals; he was now approaching the age where he hoped to achieve mental vitality through physical satisfaction.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:51] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the Stevenes, when mentally exhausted, tended to favor material things; when their activities decreased, they tended to passively accept influences.\n[1897-08-13 04:23:56] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the mental fatigue and decreased activity of the Stevenes had begun to make them agree with the idea that there might indeed be certain privileged bodies, professions, and rhythms that could so naturally achieve the Stevenes' ideals that, even without genius, by merely copying a certain shoulder movement, a certain tension in the neck, the Stevenes could create a masterpiece.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:01] The studio of Elstir | I thought this was the age when Stevenes liked to caress beauty with their eyes, this beauty that lay outside of them, beside them, on a tapestry, in a beautiful sketch by Titian found in an antique shop, or in a mistress as beautiful as the Titian sketch.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:06] The studio of Elstir | I thought that after Steven understood all this, every time he saw Madame George, he could no longer help feeling happy, for her body had lost its heavy bulk, since Steven had filled her form with the idea that she was a non-material being, a reflection of George as seen through Steven's eyes.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought that for Steven, she was also a portrait, and perhaps for him as well.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:16] The studio of Elstir | I thought that for an artist, the materials of life don't count; they are only an opportunity to reveal his talent.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought about looking at the ten different portrait paintings George had created together, and one would clearly feel that, first of all, these people were all members of the same family as George.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought of genius surging and overwhelming life, but only when the mind grew tired and gradually lost its balance did life regain the upper hand, like a great river that returns to its normal flow only after a high tide has caused the water to surge back.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:31] The studio of Elstir | I thought about how, in the first stage, the artist gradually discovers the laws and patterns of a genius he is not even aware of.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:36] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if he were a novelist, he would know which situations could provide him with material; if he were a painter, he would know which scenes could provide him with material.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:41] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the subject itself was unimportant, but essential to his exploration, just as a laboratory or a studio is essential.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:46] The studio of Elstir | I thought he clearly knew that the effect produced by soft light, the guilt arising from changing his view of a certain fault, and the beautiful girls like statues standing under trees or half-submerged in water—these were what made his masterpiece.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:51] The studio of Elstir | I thought that there would finally come a day when his brain had deteriorated, and he would no longer be able to perform mental activity with the materials of his genius, for only mental activity produces works.\n[1897-08-13 04:24:56] The studio of Elstir | I thought that he would continue to search for these materials, delighted to be surrounded by them, because they aroused in him a spiritual joy, and spiritual joy is the catalyst of work.\n[1897-08-13 04:25:01] The studio of Elstir | I thought he would shroud these materials in an atmosphere of superstition, as if they were above all else, as if a large part of the artwork was already contained within them, as if they somehow contained a finished artwork already.\n[1897-08-13 04:25:06] The studio of Elstir | I thought of his frequent visits to the model and his excessive fondness for her, that was all; he would not go any further.\n[1897-08-13 04:25:11] The studio of Elstir | I thought he would go on endlessly talking to some repentant murderers, whose remorse and depravity had once formed the subject of his novels; he would buy a country house in a land where the mist made the sunlight gentle; he would spend hours watching women bathe; he would collect fine fabrics.\n[1897-08-13 04:25:16] The studio of Elstir | I thought that \"life is beautiful\" is, in a way, a meaningless word, still below the realm of art.\n[1897-08-13 04:25:21] The studio of Elstir | I thought that Steven had seen Matthew and had remained stuck at that stage.\n[1897-08-13 04:25:26] The studio of Elstir | I thought that the stage in which life seems beautiful is one that, due to the slowing of creative genius, due to the idolatry of all the forms that promote creative genius, and due to a desire to work less, people like George would eventually gradually slip into.",

    "text": "[1897-08-14 05:53:49] The studio of Elstir | I saw him finally put the finishing touch on his flower painting. Steven looked at the flowers and wasted another few minutes.\n[1897-08-14 05:53:59] The studio of Elstir | I thought that since Steven knew those girls probably wouldn't be back on the beach, it wasn't such a big deal for Steven to waste time looking at flowers.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:04] The studio of Elstir | I thought that even if Steven believed they were still on the beach, spending these few minutes would make him miss meeting them, but he would still look, because Steven was thinking to himself that George was probably more interested in his flowers than in Steven meeting these girls.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:09] The studio of Elstir | I thought of Steven's grandmother, whose nature was entirely the opposite of Steven's selfishness, yet her nature still found some reflection in Steven's.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:14] The studio of Elstir | I thought of a person completely unrelated to Steven, someone whom Steven had always pretended to be fond of or respectful toward. When Steven was in danger, while this person only had minor troubles, Steven would express deep sympathy for his troubles as if they were major issues, while he himself regarded his own peril as trivial, because Steven felt that, in his view, things were probably proportioned that way.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:19] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, honestly speaking, it was even worse: Steven not only did not lament his own dangerous situation, but actually went straight toward the risk; whereas when it came to other people's dangers, he did the opposite, trying to keep others from danger even if he himself was more likely to be hit by it.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:24] The studio of Elstir | I thought of many reasons for doing it, which would not really enhance Steven's reputation; one of them was that although Steven, when he was constantly thinking, considered his own life very important.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:29] The studio of Elstir | I thought that, throughout Steven's life, whenever Steven was tormented by moral anxieties or even just by mental unrest—sometimes such mental unrest was so childish that Steven himself dared not speak it aloud—if suddenly some unexpected situation arose that threatened Steven's life, this new burden was so light in comparison to other burdens that Steven would feel relieved, even joyful, in facing the danger.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:34] The studio of Elstir | I thought that although Steven was the most timid person in the world, he had once experienced such a fascination with danger; when Steven thought about it rationally, it seemed so out of character for him, so unimaginable.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:39] The studio of Elstir | I thought that even in a completely calm and happy phase, when some kind of danger, a life-threatening one, occurred—for example, when Steven was with someone else—Steven would still not place others in a safe position, but instead choose the dangerous one for himself.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:44] The studio of Elstir | I realized that a considerable number of practical experiences had made Steven understand that, when Steven always did things happily and willingly, Steven discovered that, contrary to what Steven had always believed and affirmed, Steven actually cared a great deal about what others thought of him, which truly embarrassed Steven.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:49] The studio of Elstir | I thought of this hidden sense of pride, which had nothing to do with vanity or arrogance, because what satisfies vanity and arrogance certainly brings no pleasure to Steven, and Steven had always been determined to avoid both vanity and arrogance.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:54] The studio of Elstir | I thought about how, in front of certain people, Steven managed to completely hide his small talents, because once they discovered these minor strengths, their opinion of Steven would no longer be so ordinary.\n[1897-08-14 05:54:59] The studio of Elstir | I thought that for these people, Steven had never been able to deprive himself of his happiness, and that what he was more eager to do was to remove the threat of death from their path rather than from his own.\n[1897-08-14 05:55:04] The studio of Elstir | I thought that since Steven's motivation was pride rather than noble character, their actions were the exact opposite of his own in any case, and Steven found this extremely natural; he would never have blamed them for it.\n[1897-08-14 05:55:09] The studio of Elstir | I thought that if Steven's motivation was driven by a sense of duty, he would probably feel that, in this case, both they and Steven himself had to do it, and they might be blamed for not doing so.\n[1897-08-14 05:55:14] The studio of Elstir | I thought the opposite; Steven felt it was wise for them to protect their own lives, yet he could not prevent himself from placing his own life in second place.\n[1897-08-14 05:55:19] The studio of Elstir | I thought about the bomb about to explode, about Steven placing himself before others, and later Steven discovered that among these people, many lives were worth less. Since then, Steven had found it especially absurd, even criminal.\n[1897-08-14 05:55:24] The studio of Elstir | I thought, to go back, that on the day I visited George, it was still a long way off for Steven to realize this gap in value, and there was no question of any danger at all—only a kind of premonitory signal of a very harmful sense of pride, which required that he not appear to value his own eagerly desired happiness more than the unfinished watercolor paintings of someone else.\n[1897-08-14 09:48:09] The painting room of Elstir | I saw the painting finally completed, and as soon as I stepped outside, Steven immediately realized the time was not as late as he had imagined. I saw how long the days were in this season.\n[1897-08-14 10:00:29] Seawall | I saw the Stevenes going up to the seawall.\n[1897-08-14 10:00:39] Location: Seawall | I saw how many tricks it took to keep George there! I thought that Steven believed those girls might pass by there again.\n[1897-08-14 10:00:44] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven pointing out to him the towering cliffs that loomed over Steven's companions, constantly urging him to talk with Steven about these girls, in order to make him forget the time and keep him there.\n[1897-08-14 10:00:54] Location: Seawall | I thought that Steven seemed more likely to head toward the end of the beach and intercept this little group.\n[1897-08-14 10:00:59] Location: Seawall | I heard Steven say to George, \"Steven would like to get a little closer with you, to take a look at these cliffs.\" I thought about how Steven had noticed that one of the girls often went that way.\n[1897-08-14 10:01:04] Location: Seawall | I heard Steven add, \"Walk while you talk to Steven about Unknown_Carquethuit! Oh, how Steven longs to go to Unknown_Carquethuit!\" I thought that the new quality so powerfully expressed in the painting \"The Harbor of Unknown_Carquethuit\" might have more to do with the painter's vision than with the beach itself having any particular value.\n[1897-08-14 10:01:09] Location: Seawall | I heard, \"Since Steven saw the painting, this port and the Bay of Tsunami might be the places Steven would most like to see. And the Bay of Tsunami is a long way from here.\"\n[1897-08-14 10:01:14] Location: Seawall | I heard George answer Steven, \"Even if Unknown_Carquethuit weren't closer, Steven would probably still be inclined to suggest you go to Unknown_Carquethuit.\"\n[1897-08-14 10:01:19] Location: Seawall | I heard him say, \"The Cape of Storms is certainly wonderful, but in the end it's just another big cliff like those in Normandy or Brittany, which you've already seen.\"\n[1897-08-14 10:01:24] Location: Seawall | \"I heard 'And Unknown_Carquethuit, with its low, rocky beach, was quite another matter. In France, Steven had never seen a landscape like it, reminding him of certain views in Florida.'\"",

I saw the night fall, and it was time to go back.\n[1897-08-14 12:28:39] Main Street | I saw it suddenly, as if Mephistopheles had abruptly appeared before Faust. At the end of the street, a few specks of the spirit emerged, which people would never confuse with anything else—several spores of the young coral-like colony. I thought of a nature entirely different from Steven's, a wild and merciless vitality that was unreal yet diabolically concrete, while Steven's sickly body, his pathological sensitivity, and his overworked mind lacked such vitality.\n[1897-08-14 12:28:44] Main Street | I saw them pretending not to see Steven. I thought, but there was no doubt that Steven was being subjected to cold, mocking criticism.\n[1897-08-14 12:28:49] Street | I turned away as soon as I saw Steven, just like a swimmer turns away when he sees a wave about to break over him. I thought of Steven, feeling that he would inevitably meet them, those Stevenes, and also felt that George was about to call Steven.\n[1897-08-14 12:28:54] Main Street | I saw Steven suddenly stop, letting his famous companion continue forward while Steven remained behind.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:04] Street | I saw the Stevenes passing by a curio shop, and Steven bent over the antique dealer's window, as though the window had suddenly caught Steven's attention.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:14] Main Street | I thought how proud Steven was to appear not to be thinking about these girls, and to be able to think about something else.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:19] Main Street | I thought, and Steven already vaguely knew that when George called out to Steven to introduce him to them, Steven would look at them with an inquisitive gaze, a gaze that showed not astonishment but the kind of feigned astonishment one pretends to feel—each person is a poor actor, or rather, everyone around us are people who judge character by appearance.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:24] Main Street | I thought that Steven might even point his finger at his chest and ask, \"Are you named Steven?\" Then he would run over eagerly, meekly lowering his head, masking his irritation with a cold expression, because Steven was deeply engrossed in admiring an ancient piece of porcelain and had been interrupted; introducing him to someone Steven did not wish to meet.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:29] Main Street | At that moment, I saw Steven examining the window display, waiting for George to call his name, like waiting for a long-anticipated but harmless bullet to finally hit him.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:34] Main Street | I thought for sure I would introduce Steven to these girls, but instead not only did I have him act as though he didn't care about them at all, but I also had to feel indifferent.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:39] Main Street | I thought that since the pleasure of meeting them was unavoidable, this pleasure was actually suppressed and reduced, and was no longer as enjoyable as talking with Peter or having dinner with David, or taking a trip nearby.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:44] Main Street | I thought that some people probably weren't very interested in ancient sites, and later, because of the delicate relationship with these people, Steven had to miss out on some excursions, which made Steven very sorry.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:49] Main Street | I thought that, in addition to making Steven's upcoming happiness seem greatly diminished, it was not only so sudden but also so disconnected and incoherent.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:54] Main Street | I thought that some laws, just as precise as those of hydrostatics, kept the images formed in Steven's mind in a fixed order, but then events suddenly appeared before me, breaking these laws.\n[1897-08-14 12:29:59] Main Street | I thought that George was about to call him Steven, and the way Steven had imagined meeting these girls on the beach, in the room, was completely different from this.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:04] Street | I thought of what was about to happen, which was another major event. Steven's mind was completely unprepared for it, and from this event, Steven could neither recognize his own yearning nor discern the object of that yearning.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:09] Main Street | I thought of Steven, and almost regretted having left with George.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:14] Street | I thought, in particular, that the happiness Steven had originally expected to feel was now greatly diminished precisely because there was certainly no longer anything that could take it away.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:19] Street | I saw Steven firmly turn his head away, and there was George standing a few paces away from the girls, saying goodbye to them. I thought of Hooke's law, and this happiness once again restored its towering image.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:24] Street | I saw the girl who was closest to him, her face large and round, her eyes shining brightly, her face like a big cake with just enough space left for the sky.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:39] Main Street | I saw her eyes, and even when they were fixed, they gave the impression of movement, like a day of howling wind, when although the air is invisible to the eye, one can feel its speed as it moves through the air.\n[1897-08-14 12:30:54] Street | I saw for a moment her eyes met Steven's, like the stormy clouds rushing across the sky, approaching a slower-moving cloud, brushing past it, touching it, then surpassing it.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:04] Street | I saw them, but they didn't know each other, each going their separate way. I thought of Steven's gaze in the same way, for a moment you were looking at Steven, and Steven was looking at you, but neither of you knew what promise or threat this heaven before you held for the future.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:09] Street | I saw that her gaze, which had not slowed down, just as it passed by Steven's, was lightly veiled in a mist.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:24] Main Street | I saw how, like a clear moonlit night, when the wind carried away the moon and a cloud covered it, for a moment the moonlight was veiled by mist, then quickly reappeared.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:39] Main Street | I saw that George had not called Steven, and he had already left the girls, who crossed the street diagonally. George came toward Steven.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:49] Main Street | I thought I had missed everything.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:54] Main Street | I thought of what Steven had once said, that day, when, in Steven's eyes, Albertine was different from before, and it seemed as though she was always changing, one moment after another.\n[1897-08-14 12:31:59] Main Street | I thought that at that moment, Steven felt that certain changes in a person's appearance, such as weight, height, or other physical characteristics, might also come from some change in the relationship between that person and Steven.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:04] Street | I thought that the most decisive factor in this matter was belief or disbelief.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:09] Street | I thought of that evening when Steven had first been certain he was about to meet Albertine, only for that certainty to vanish in an instant, making her at first insignificant and then suddenly invaluable in his eyes.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:14] Main Street | I thought of how, some years later, I had first been certain that Albertine would remain faithful to Steven, and then this certainty faded, bringing about similar changes.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:19] Street | I thought, of course, that in Sunrise, depending on the time, and according to the two ways that divided Steven's most sensitive spot, whether Steven entered one or the other, he had already felt that the pain of not being with Robert would either shrink or grow.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:24] Street | I thought of the whole afternoon, and Robert was like the moonlight that is unnoticed when the sun is high, but once night falls, she alone occupied Steven's restless heart, so much so that even the most recent memories had already vanished completely.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:29] Street | I saw it that day when Steven saw George not calling Steven, as he was leaving the girls. I thought to myself that Steven had understood again; a joy or a sorrow, in the eyes of Stevenes, could vary in intensity not only because of a shift between two states, but also due to an invisible shift in belief.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:34] Main Street | I thought of how such an invisible faith could make Stevenes face death fearlessly, because this faith cast an unrealistic glow over death, and it was also this faith that made Stevenes value attending a music party so much.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:39] Street | I thought, but once it was announced that Steven's group would be sent to the guillotine, the musical evening immediately lost its charm, and the faith that had enveloped the gathering would suddenly disappear.",

    "text": "[1897-08-14 12:32:44] Main Street | I thought about the effect of this \"letter,\" and something in my mind was really clear about it: that is, will.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:49] Main Street | I thought, but if reason and feeling continue to ignore this influence, then even a clear will is useless, because reason and feeling believe that the Stevenes want to leave their mistress, while only the Stevenes' own will knows that their hearts are still attached to her.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:54] Street | I thought that at such moments, reason and feeling were trustworthy, precisely because faith had blurred them, so Stevens could only regain their faith at such times.\n[1897-08-14 12:32:59] Main Street | I thought, but once this belief dissipated, once reason and feeling realized that the mistress had completely vanished, then reason and feeling lost all direction and became uncontrollable, so that small pleasures expanded into infinity.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:04] Street | I thought that the emptiness of love was also a kind of faith; love had always existed, was moving about everywhere, and it settled on the image of a particular woman only because that woman was almost unattainable.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:09] Main Street | I thought that from this moment on, I wouldn't think much about this woman, and it was hard to picture her in my mind; instead, I considered more how to get her.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:14] Main Street | I thought of a series of worries that grew within me, which was enough to fix Steven's love upon her, making her the object of his almost unfamiliar affection.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:19] Main Street | I thought about how love had become so vast, how small a place the real woman occupied within it, and the Stevenes didn't even consider that.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:24] Main Street | I thought that if, all of a sudden, just like the moment Steven saw George stop and speak to the girls, the Stevenes would stop being anxious and uneasy. Since their entire love was centered on her, when they finally caught their prey, that love might suddenly vanish, and they had not really considered the true value of the prey.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:29] Main Street | What did Steven know about Albertine?\n[1897-08-14 12:33:34] Street | I thought of the few figures reflected on the sea, which were certainly not as beautiful as the profiles of the girls in Veronese's paintings. If Steven had yielded to purely aesthetic reasons, he would have preferred those girls to Albertine.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:39] Main Street | I thought, but could Steven obey for any other reason, since, after losing his anxiety, Steven could only rediscover these silent figures, and had nothing else at all?\n[1897-08-14 12:33:44] Street | I thought of how, since Steven had met Albertine, he had had countless thoughts about her each day, engaging in inner dialogues with what Steven called \"her,\" in which Steven would have her ask questions, answer, think, and act.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:49] Main Street | I thought of how, in Steven's mind, an endless stream of imagined Albertines constantly appeared, one after another.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:54] Main Street | I thought that the real Albertine, the one I had seen from afar on the beach, appeared only at the beginning of this long series, just as a star actor appears only at the opening performance of a long-running play.\n[1897-08-14 12:33:59] Main Street | I thought of this Albertine as nothing more than a silhouette, all the added qualities were merely Steven's assumptions.\n[1897-08-14 12:34:04] Main Street | I thought that in matters of love, the embellishments and additions that Steven's heart creates are far greater than anything that comes to Steven's heart from the person he loves--even in terms of quantity.\n[1897-08-14 12:34:09] Main Street | I thought that real love was like this too: some people not only could cultivate feelings for Steven, but could also live on the basis of just a little something— even among those who had already experienced physical satisfaction.\n[1897-08-14 12:34:14] Main Street | I know that Steven's grandmother once had a drawing teacher, who had a daughter with an unknown mistress. Not long after the child was born, Robert died.\n[1897-08-14 12:34:34] Street | I knew the art teacher was so heartbroken that he didn't live much longer. In fact, he had never officially lived with her, and they hadn't really been lovers.\n[1897-08-14 12:34:54] Main Street | I knew that my David and the ladies of Sunrise would not even dare to mention this woman in front of their teacher.\n[1897-08-14 12:35:14] Street | I knew that in the last few months of his life, they had thought of securing the girl's future, each of them contributing some money to arrange a lifetime annuity for her.\n[1897-08-14 12:35:34] Street | I knew it had been David's idea, and some of her friends were quite reluctant, thinking: was this girl really so interesting? And was she really the daughter of the man who claimed to be her father?\n[1897-08-14 12:35:54] Street | I knew that for people like Robert, who were always uncertain about the little girl, they eventually made up their minds.\n[1897-08-14 12:36:14] Street | I knew the girl had come to thank me, and she was as ugly as the aged art teacher, and in an instant all my doubts vanished.\n[1897-08-14 12:36:34] Street | I knew the only thing the girl had that was good was her hair, and a lady said to the James who had brought his little daughter: \"What lovely hair she has!\"\n[1897-08-14 12:36:54] Street | I knew that Steven's grandmother thought that since the guilty Robert was already dead and the art teacher would soon be too, it no longer mattered to mention the once-secret affair, so she added: \"It must have come from the family, wasn't her Robert's hair very fine?\"\n[1897-08-14 12:37:14] Street | \"I know 'Steven doesn't know,' \" the child's James answered naively, \"when Steven saw her, she always wore a hat.\"\n[1897-08-14 12:37:34] Street | I realized I should go after George.\n[1897-08-14 12:37:39] Main Street | I saw Steven seeing himself in a large mirror. I saw Steven realize that his tie was completely crooked and that his long hair was sticking out of his hat, making him look very unattractive.\n[1897-08-14 12:37:49] Main Street | I thought that, apart from the great misfortune of not being introduced, in any case, they had encountered Steven and George together, and would not forget Steven.\n[1897-08-14 12:37:54] Main Street | I thought that was already good luck.\n[1897-08-14 12:37:59] Street | That day, I followed Steven's grandmother's advice and had Steven wear the beautiful sweater and carry his most handsome walking stick. I know that Steven almost put on another ugly vest.\n[1897-08-14 12:38:09] Main Street | I thought this was another stroke of good fortune.\n[1897-08-14 12:38:14] Main Street | I thought about how the major events that Steven and others expected never happened quite as Steven and others had anticipated, because the favorable conditions they thought could be relied upon were missing.\n[1897-08-14 12:38:19] Main Street | Other major events, which I thought and the Stevenes did not wish for, kept coming one after another, reinforcing each other.\n[1897-08-14 12:38:24] Street | I thought of the Stevenes, who were so afraid of the worst, and yet in the end, the Stevenes would come to believe that, overall, chance had actually been somewhat helpful to them.\n[1897-08-14 12:38:29] Main Street | I saw Steven go up to George. I heard Steven say to him, \"How happy Steven would be if he had met them!\"\n[1897-08-14 12:38:34] Street | \"I heard, 'Then why were you hiding ten miles away?'\"\n[1897-08-14 12:38:39] Main Street | I thought that was what he had said, and it was not because this expressed his thoughts that he had said it.\n[1897-08-14 12:38:44] Street | I thought, if fulfilling Steven's wish is his wish, then calling out to Steven would be as easy as pie?",

Those girls, Steven had asked him so many questions about them, and he clearly saw that Steven was interested in them!\n[1897-08-15 05:56:47] At Elstir's doorstep | I saw Steven about to part with him at his doorstep. I heard him say to Steven, \"Steven was just talking about Unknown_Carquethuit with you.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:56:52] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"Steven once drew a sketch in which the outline of the beach was clearly visible. The painting wasn't too bad, but it's no longer comparable.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:56:57] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"If you'll allow it, in memory of our friendship, Steven is giving you the sketch.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:57:02] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard him add, \"He who refuses to give you what you long for gives you something else instead.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:57:07] At Elstir's doorstep | \"I heard, 'If you have one, Steven would very much like a photograph of John's portrait, but what is this name, anyway?'\"\n[1897-08-15 05:57:12] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"This is the name of the role that model played in a ridiculous light opera.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:57:17] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"Sir, Steven doesn't know her at all, you know that, but your manner seems to suggest otherwise.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:57:22] At Elstir's doorstep | I saw George silent.\n[1897-08-15 05:57:32] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard Steven say, \"That's not Matthew's wife before the marriage, is it!\" I thought of Steven, who had suddenly and unfortunately been right.\n[1897-08-15 05:57:37] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that such situations were quite rare, yet they provided some basis for the theory of premonition, provided one deliberately forgot all the errors that could invalidate this theory.\n[1897-08-15 05:57:42] In front of Elstir's house | I knew it was a portrait of John de Crécy, and she had many reasons for not wanting to keep it, some quite obvious, and others perhaps more obscure.\n[1897-08-15 05:58:02] At Elstir's doorstep | I knew the portrait was from an earlier time; afterward, John had trained her lines, transforming her face and figure into this present creation.\n[1897-08-15 05:58:22] At Elstir's doorstep | I know that year after year, her hairdresser, her dressmaker, and she herself, in the way she sat or lay, in the way she spoke, smiled, placed her hands, conveyed her gaze, and thought, all had to conform to the general outline of this creation.\n[1897-08-15 05:58:42] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that only a lover who had grown weary of passion could have become so depraved as Matthew, who in the countless photographs of his enchanting wife, John, took a particular liking to that small picture from his own bedroom.\n[1897-08-15 05:58:47] At Elstir's doorstep | I saw in that photograph, what people saw was a rather ugly and thin young woman, wearing a straw hat decorated with violets, her hair disheveled, and her body emaciated.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:02] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought, and yet, even if this portrait was not painted, like Matthew's beloved little photograph, before John's lines were systematized into a new, dignified, and fascinating figure, but rather after that, it would still be enough for George's eye to dismantle this type.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:07] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that extremely high temperatures could break apart atomic structures and reassemble these atoms in a completely opposite sequence, just like an artistic genius could do.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:12] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of the artificial harmony this woman imposed on her various body parts, how she would scrutinize herself carefully in front of the mirror before leaving each day, determined to maintain it.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:17] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of adjusting the tilt of my hat, the smoothness of my hair, and the liveliness of my gaze in order to maintain this harmony.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:22] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of this harmony, which a great painter's gaze could destroy in a single moment, replacing it with another arrangement of a woman's lines, in order to fully satisfy some ideal feminine beauty or artistic beauty within his heart.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:27] The doorstep of Elstir's house | I thought, and it was also often the case that, from a certain age onward, a great researcher's gaze could everywhere find the necessary elements that formed a particular relationship, and he was only interested in such relationships.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:32] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of those workers and gamblers who never hesitate, taking whatever comes their way, and for any old thing, they can say: \"Yes, that's fine.\"\n[1897-08-15 05:59:37] At Elstir's doorstep | I know a cousin of the Marquise de Luxembourg, the most proud and beautiful woman, who once fell in love with an art that was still new at the time; she had one of the greatest naturalist painters paint her portrait.\n[1897-08-15 05:59:57] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought the artist's gaze had at last found what he was searching for everywhere.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:02] At Elstir's doorstep | I saw that instead of a lady of high society, the canvas depicted a female errand girl, with a broad purple background sloping downwards behind her, evoking the Place du Pari.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:17] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of a portrait of a woman painted by a great artist, who didn't bother at all to meet certain demands of the woman, but instead emphasized her hidden flaws, such as a flushed face, even a bluish or purplish one.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:22] At Elstir's doorstep | I know that some women, already beginning to grow old, insist on dressing in little girl's clothes so that people will take their pictures, and these little girl's clothes make them appear still to have a youthful figure, while their own daughter, standing beside them, is dressed in a way that conforms to the occasion—very unattractive indeed.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:42] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that it was precisely because of these shortcomings—\"so full of character\"—that they were even more attractive to the painter. Even without going as far as that, having these was enough to disillusion the unrefined viewer and shatter his ideals.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:47] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of that woman, who so proudly upheld the framework of this ideal, and it was precisely this ideal, in its singular and unconquerable form, that placed her outside and above humanity.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:52] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that now, this woman had been cast down, removed from the secure and inviolable prototype she once occupied, and was nothing more than an ordinary woman, and Stevens had lost all confidence in her exceptional nature.\n[1897-08-15 06:00:57] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought about how, in general, Stevens go to such great lengths not only to display John's beauty but also to embody her personality and characteristics.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:02] At Elstir's doorstep | I found myself standing in front of this portrait that had been stripped of John's beauty, personality, and distinctive features, and Steven would not only exclaim, \"She's even uglier than she is!\" but also cry out, \"It doesn't look like her at all!\"\n[1897-08-15 06:01:07] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought how Steven and others could hardly believe it was her, they hadn't recognized her.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:12] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of this man, and the Stevenes certainly felt they had met him somewhere before, but this man was not John.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:17] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of this person's face, posture, and expression, which Steven and others were very familiar with.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:22] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought about how all this made Steven remember, not the woman John, who never took such a position, whose usual posture would never outline such an absurd and provocative Arabic pattern.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:27] At Elstir's doorstep | It was other women, the ones who had inspired Steven's memories, all the women George had painted.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:32] At Elstir's doorstep | I know that although these women were very different from each other, George always liked them to pose facing forward, with their arches curved, their skirts lifted, and large round straw hats held in their hands, the hats covering up to the level of their knees, forming a second circle that corresponded with the face when viewed from the front.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:52] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that, in general, a portrait of genius not only dissects the original model of a woman—the type determined by her coquetry and her self-centered concept of beauty—but if the portrait is old, it also fails to content itself with making the original look aged by dressing her in outdated clothes, as a photograph would.\n[1897-08-15 06:01:57] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that in the portrait, what marked the passage of time was not only how the woman was dressed, but also how the artist had painted her.\n[1897-08-15 06:02:02] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of this painting method, which was George's earliest method, namely extracting the most pressing issue regarding John's origin.\n[1897-08-15 06:02:07] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that this painting not only portrayed her as a later representative of the famous courtesans like John, but also became a contemporary work to the many portraits painted by Manet or Whistler.\n[1897-08-15 06:02:12] At Elstir's doorstep | I knew that the models on which the works of Manet or Whistler were based had long since vanished, becoming forgotten or mere relics of history.",

    "text": "[1897-08-15 14:47:06] Main Street | I saw Steven walking George home, silently chewing over these thoughts beside him. I thought of the discovery of its model's identity, which had led Steven to these thoughts.\n[1897-08-15 14:47:11] Street | I thought that this first discovery led to a second one, the discovery of the artist himself, which unsettled Steven even more.\n[1897-08-15 14:47:16] Main Street | I thought of the portrait he had painted of John de Crevin, this genius, this wise man, this solitary figure, this philosopher whose speech was astonishing and who always achieved something remarkable in everything he did—could he possibly be the same ridiculous and incorrigibly bad painter who had once been taken in by the Verdurins?\n[1897-08-15 14:47:21] Street | I heard Steven ask him if he knew the Verdurin family, and whether by chance they had given him the nickname Mr. George at that time.\n[1897-08-15 14:47:26] Street | I saw him answer Steven that he was, and I didn't feel embarrassed. I thought that this was already a rather distant part of his life, and I seemed to have expected that it would evoke an extremely disappointing feeling in Steven's heart.\n[1897-08-15 14:47:31] Street | I saw him look up, and from Steven's facial expression, I caught that emotion. I saw his face show an expression of dissatisfaction.\n[1897-08-15 14:47:41] Street | At that moment, the Stevenes were almost at his front door.\n[1897-08-15 16:13:26] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that if I had chosen someone less noble in mind and heart, it would have been a simple, dry farewell, after which I would have avoided seeing Steven again. But George did not do that with Steven.\n[1897-08-15 16:13:31] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that as a true mentor—perhaps his only flaw, from a purely creative point of view, was his tendency to be didactic, because an artist, in order to be completely on the side of truth in spiritual life, should remain solitary and not squander himself on Steven, even with some of his pupils.\n[1897-08-15 16:13:36] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that, in any situation, he always tried to uncover a part of the truth contained within a given circumstance, even if that truth was relative to him or to others.\n[1897-08-15 16:13:41] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that rather than say a few words that might save his own dignity, he would prefer to say a few that would be instructive for Steven.\n[1897-08-15 16:13:46] The doorstep of Elstir | I heard him say to Steven, \"There's probably no one, however wise, at some stage in his youth, who hasn't said something or lived a certain way that he later regrets, wishing he could erase it.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:13:51] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"But he shouldn't feel absolute remorse for it, because only through the revelation of all the ridiculous and disgusting things could he be certain of becoming a sage within possible limits.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:13:56] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"This ridiculous and repulsive manifestation should be the precursor to the final one.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:01] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard him say, \"Steven knows some young people who are descendants of distinguished figures, and their private tutors have taught them to be spiritually noble and morally upright since their school days.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:06] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard him say, \"Perhaps there is no place in their lives that needs to be hidden; everything they have said can be published, signed with their own names.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:11] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"But they are people of poor spirit, the weak descendants of doctrinaires, their wisdom is passive, and it bears no fruit.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:16] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard him say, \"Wisdom cannot be accepted; one must walk the path oneself and discover it. No one can walk it for Steven, no one can spare Steven this journey, because wisdom is simply a perspective on things.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:21] The doorstep of Elstir's house | I heard, \"The dignified manner of the person you admire is not arranged by a parent or governess.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:26] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"The forerunner of these things is a completely different beginning in life, shaped by the evil or vulgar forces that dominate the surroundings, representing a battle, a triumph.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:31] At Elstir's doorstep | \"I heard that Steven's image in the initial stages was unclear and unrecognizable, and in any case, it was unlikable, which Steven understood.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:36] At Elstir's doorstep | I heard, \"But the Stevenes shouldn't deny this image, because it is a witness to what the Stevenes have actually experienced. According to the laws of life and thought, the Stevenes extract something beyond all of this from the common elements of life—if a painter, then also from studio life and the artistic circle.\"\n[1897-08-15 16:14:41] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that by now, the Stevenes had already reached their doorstep without having met those girls, and Steven was very disappointed.\n[1897-08-15 16:14:46] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought, but now there is finally a faint hope of finding them again in life.\n[1897-08-15 16:14:51] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that they would no longer appear from the horizon as they once had, and Steven would never again see them coming from there.\n[1897-08-15 16:14:56] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of the great vortex that had once isolated the Stevenes, which was no longer floating around them.\n[1897-08-15 16:15:01] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that this great whirlpool was nothing more than the manifestation of a desire that would always remain out of their reach, forever slipping away and arousing in Steven's heart.\n[1897-08-15 16:15:06] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of this desire, which was constantly stirring within me, uncertain, impatient, and full of anxiety.\n[1897-08-15 16:15:11] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought of Steven's desire for them, and now I could set it aside for a while, storing it up along with many other desires.\n[1897-08-15 16:15:16] At Elstir's doorstep | I thought that once Steven realized these desires could be fulfilled, he would keep postponing the moment of realization.\n[1897-08-15 16:15:21] At Elstir's doorstep | I saw Steven leave George, and once again he was alone.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:26] Main Street | At that moment, I suddenly saw all these coincidences in Steven's mind, even though he was disappointed.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:31] Main Street | I thought about these coincidences, which had completely taken Steven by surprise, since George was closely connected with these girls.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:36] Street | I thought of these girls, and that very morning, they had still been figures on a painting of the sea in Steven's possession; now, they saw Steven, saw Steven in close contact with a great painter.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:41] Street | I thought that the painter, now knowing Steven's desire to meet them, would certainly help Steven, and all of this filled Steven's heart with immense joy.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:46] Street | I thought, but this happiness remained hidden from Steven.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:51] Main Street | I thought some guests had arrived and had already been announced, but they were waiting for other guests to leave, coming out only when no one else was present.\n[1897-08-15 21:09:56] Street | I thought that, and so the Stevenes saw them, the Stevenes could say to them, \"We are coming to see you,\" and listen to their conversation, this kind of pleasure belonged to such guests.\n[1897-08-15 21:10:01] Street | I thought that sometimes, between the moment when this happiness entered Steven's heart and the moment when Steven himself could enter this happiness, many more moments had passed. In this interval, Steven had met so many people that he began to worry that this happiness probably wouldn't wait for him anymore.",

I knew that in the days to come, time would be taken up by Peter's preparations for his departure.\n[1897-08-15 23:49:56] Balbec | I thought that, at this moment, it was very likely that Steven would meet them at the time he had hoped for, bringing peace to his soul, a peace that was especially precious.\n[1897-08-15 23:50:01] Balbec | I knew that Steven's friends were very attentive to David and Steven, and David greatly wished to show her gratitude to him.\n[1897-08-15 23:50:21] Balbec | I had learned from Steven that Peter greatly admired Proudhon, which gave my grandmother an idea; she ordered that many of the philosopher's autographed letters, which she had previously purchased, be brought to her.\n[1897-08-16 11:04:54] Balbec Hotel | The day I saw these things was the evening before Peter's departure, when he came to the hotel to see me.\n[1897-08-16 11:05:04] Balbec Hotel | I saw him greedily reading those letters, respectfully running his hands over each page, and trying desperately to memorize every sentence.\n[1897-08-16 11:05:14] Balbec Hotel | I saw him get up to take his leave, asking Steven's grandmother to forgive him for staying so long.\n[1897-08-16 11:05:24] Balbec Hotel | I heard David answer him: \"No need, take it. It's for you. Steven had someone bring it here specifically to give to you.\"\n[1897-08-16 11:05:29] Balbec Hotel | I couldn't help but show my delight at seeing him, no more able to control myself than I could control a physical condition beyond my will.\n[1897-08-16 11:05:39] Balbec Hotel | I saw him with a flushed face, like a child who had just been punished.\n[1897-08-16 11:05:49] Balbec Hotel | I saw him thanking me again and again, and trying (without success) to control the joy that surged through his entire body.\n[1897-08-16 11:05:59] Hotel Balbec | I thought of Steven; my grandmother was even more moved by how he controlled himself in such a way.\n[1897-08-16 11:06:04] The little train | The next day, when he returned to his garrison by the local train, he leaned out of the window and asked Steven for forgiveness. I thought, but Peter had always been worried that he hadn't expressed the proper amount of gratitude.\n[1897-08-17 12:23:59] Balbec Station | I knew that his quarters were not far away, and he had intended to take a carriage, since he would return that evening and it wasn't a case of leaving for good.\n[1897-08-17 12:24:19] Balbec Station | I thought, but this time, many suitcases had to be put into the compartment, and he felt it was simpler to take the train.\n[1897-08-17 12:24:24] Balbec Station | I saw that in this matter, he had taken the station master's advice, when he had asked the station master's opinion. I heard the station master say that the carriage or the little train \"was almost meaningless.\"\n[1897-08-17 12:24:29] Balbec Station | I thought that he understood the sentence to mean \"almost the same\" (in short, it was about the same as what Françoise had meant when she said \"it's almost the same thing\").\n[1897-08-17 12:24:34] Balbec Station | \"I heard 'Well,' Peter concluded, 'Steven will take this winding little railway train!'\"\n[1897-08-17 12:24:39] Balbec Station | I thought that if Steven weren't so ill, he would have taken the little train and accompanied his friend all the way to East Clichy.\n[1897-08-17 12:24:44] Balbec Station | During the time Steven and his friends were staying at the Riverside station, Steven had promised to visit him at least a few times a week.\n[1897-08-17 12:24:54] Balbec Station | I saw the locomotive driver calmly waiting for some friends who were arriving late; he wouldn't start the train without them, and at the same time he was calmly drinking a cold beverage.\n[1897-08-17 12:25:09] Balbec Station | I saw Richard come to the station to see me off. I thought Peter hated him.\n[1897-08-18 15:00:00] Balbec Station | I heard Peter, upon learning that I was going to Étretat for lunch, dinner, and to stay, finally say to him: \"If you happen to pass through Étretat one afternoon and Steven is free, you can come to the command post to see Steven.\"\n[1897-08-18 15:00:05] Balbec Station | I heard, \"But then, to say he's free, Steven is almost never free.\" I thought of the tone as extremely cold, its mission being to correct the forced enthusiasm of the invitation, preventing Richard from taking it seriously.\n[1897-08-18 15:00:10] Balbec Station | I thought Peter might also be worried that if Steven were alone, he wouldn't go. He assumed Steven's friendship with Richard was stronger than what Steven himself had said, so he thought it would be good for Steven to have a companion, someone to encourage him.\n[1897-08-18 15:00:15] Balbec Station | I feared that Steven's manner of inviting someone while at the same time urging them not to come would annoy Richard, and I thought that Peter might have been better off saying nothing at all.\n[1897-08-18 15:00:20] Street | After I saw the train leave, Steven and Richard left the station together, walking all the way to the intersection where Steven's street and Richard's street diverged. I thought that Steven was wrong.\n[1897-08-19 00:58:18] Main Street | I heard that one street led to the hotel and another to Richard's villa. Along the entire route, Richard kept asking Steven when he and the others would go to Étretat, because \"Peter was so kind to Steven,\" and if they didn't accept the invitation, it would be \"too insensitive.\"\n[1897-08-19 00:58:23] Street | I thought of Steven, who was happy he hadn't noticed how unurgent, how barely polite the invitation had been worded.\n[1897-08-19 00:58:28] Street | I thought perhaps he hadn't been angry enough yet to pretend not to notice.\n[1897-08-19 00:58:33] Street | I thought that Steven was still thinking of him, hoping he wouldn't go to East Cottier right away and become the butt of jokes.\n[1897-08-19 00:58:38] Street | I thought, but Steven was too afraid to show him that Peter was not nearly as eager as he was, and he didn't dare offer him a suggestion, which would only have made him unhappy.\n[1897-08-19 00:58:43] Main Street | I thought he was simply unbearable, although his shortcomings could certainly be compensated by some outstanding virtues; others who were more reserved wouldn't have these flaws, but his brazenness really annoyed me.\n[1897-08-19 00:58:48] Main Street | I thought that, as he said, the Stevenes had to go to Eastville within the week (he said \"the Stevenes,\" Steven thought, perhaps he was hoping that Steven would go, in order to use him as an excuse).\n[1897-08-19 00:58:53] Main Street | I saw him stop all along the way, at the tree-lined stadium, at the tennis court, at the town hall, and even at the seafood vendor, asking Steven to set a date.\n[1897-08-20 02:17:13] Main Street | I saw Steven was unwilling, and when he left Steven, he got angry. I heard him say to Steven, \"Go ahead, sir. Whatever the case, Steven has to go, since he asked Steven.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:17:18] Balbec | On the third day, Steven received a letter from him. I thought Peter was especially worried that he hadn't shown enough gratitude to Steven's grandmother.\n[1897-08-20 02:17:23] Balbec | I saw that in this letter, he again asked Steven to thank David.\n[1897-08-20 02:17:33] Balbec | I saw that the letter had been sent from the city where he was stationed, and the post office had stamped the envelope with the name of that city.\n[1897-08-20 02:17:48] Balbec | I thought of the letter as if it were rushing toward Steven, saying to him within the four walls of the Louis XVI cavalry barracks that he missed Steven.\n[1897-08-20 02:17:53] Balbec | I saw Steven looking at the letter and recognizing the coat of arms of Mantes, which showed a lion standing proudly atop a wreath, with a French senator's cap forming a circle beneath the wreath.\n[1897-08-20 02:18:08] Balbec | I heard him write to Steven: \"The journey was smooth. I read a book I bought at the station along the way. The author's name is Alfred Baring.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:13] Balbec | I heard \"Steven thought the author was Russian, and he found it amazing that a foreigner could write so well.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:18] Balbec | I heard, \"Tell Steven what you think of this book! You're probably familiar with it, you're a learned scholar who reads everything.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:23] Balbec | I heard \"Steven is back to this vulgar life again, alas! Steven feels as if he's been exiled here.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:28] Balbec | I heard, \"Everything that Steven left behind in Riverside is not here, and in this life, Steven could find no warm memories, no charm of wisdom.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:33] Balbec | I heard, \"You will certainly look down on such a living environment, but this life also has its touching aspects.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:38] Balbec | I heard, \"Since Steven left here last time, Steven seems to feel that everything has changed, because during that time, an important period of Steven's life began, the period in which the friendship between Steven and others started.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:43] Balbec | I heard, \"Steven hopes this era will never end. Steven only speaks about this era to one person, to you. That person is Steven's girlfriend.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:48] Balbec | I heard that she had unexpectedly come to Steven's side, and that Steven spent an hour with her. She very much wanted to meet you, and Steven thought that you two would get along very well, because she was also very fond of literature.\n[1897-08-20 02:18:53] Balbec | I heard, \"On the contrary, in order to recall our conversation, to relive those moments that Steven will never forget, Steven actually avoids his own companions.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:18:58] Balbec | I heard, \"They are fine young men, but Steven said these things to them, and they might not understand.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:19:03] Balbec | I heard, \"For the first day of the time spent together, Steven almost preferred to recall it alone, without writing to you.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:19:08] Balbec | I heard, \"But you are so thoughtful and sensitive, and I'm afraid you might start worrying if you don't receive a letter from Steven.\"\n[1897-08-20 02:19:13] Balbec | I heard, \"You are willing to accept this rough cavalryman, but you'll have to work hard to make him more refined, more delicate, more suitable for you.\"\n[1897-08-23 14:40:59] Balbec | I thought of the letter, and in terms of tenderness, it was basically very similar to the letter Steven had imagined himself writing to Steven.\n[1897-08-23 14:41:04] Balbec | I thought of Steven, who had not yet met Peter, and later, the latter's first reception was very cold, which woke Steven up from his fantasy and forced him to face the cold reality.\n[1897-08-23 14:41:09] Balbec | I thought that this cold reality was not as unchangeable as it had always seemed.",

I thought about how the letter always showed a second face, the one a person displays when they are not present.\n[1897-08-23 14:41:19] Balbec Restaurant | I thought that from the lines of this face (the characteristics of handwriting), the Stevenes had no reason to believe that they couldn't grasp a person's soul, just as they could from the lines of a nose or the inflections of a voice.\n[1897-08-24 04:45:00] Restaurant Balbec | Now, when the dishes were being cleared from the table, Steven sat quietly at his place.\n[1897-08-25 07:35:59] Restaurant Balbec | I realized that if it hadn't been for the moment when those girls might have passed by, Steven wouldn't have just been gazing out to sea.\n[1897-08-25 07:36:09] Balbec Restaurant | I saw the interrupted gesture of the knife and fork still lying askew, the napkin's bulging circle, and the sunlight added another patch of yellow velvet on top of it.\n[1897-08-25 07:36:24] Balbec Restaurant | I saw the half-filled glass more clearly, its elegant shape—narrow at the bottom, wide at the top. The deep red of the remaining wine gleamed brightly at the bottom of the translucent glass, as if it wereconcentrating the gaze.\n[1897-08-26 10:27:07] Balbec Restaurant | I saw the moving container, and the light caused the liquid drink to transform.\n[1897-08-26 10:27:22] Balbec Restaurant | I saw the plums in the high fruit dish, changing from green to blue, then again to gold.\n[1897-08-26 10:27:37] Balbec Restaurant | I saw the old chairs being moved around, arriving twice a day to sit around the tablecloth; once properly laid out, it seemed like an altar, and here the feast was celebrated.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:16] Restaurant Balbec | I saw on the tablecloth, a few drops of crystal-clear juice still remained at the bottom of the oyster shells, like drops of water in a small stone basin used for holy water.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:31] Balbec Restaurant | I thought of how, since I first saw such things in the watercolors George had painted, Steven had desperately tried to find them again in reality. Steven liked these things, just as he liked certain poetic and picturesque elements.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:36] Balbec Restaurant | I thought of the places where Steven had never imagined beauty, of the beauty he tirelessly sought in the most ordinary objects, in the profound life of still lifes.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:41] The Elstir's house | A few days after Peter had left, Steven finally managed to arrange a small gathering for George. I thought about the reception, where Steven would meet Albertine.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:46] The Grand Hotel | I saw Steven leaving the big hotel. I thought that people found Steven endlessly charming and refined.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:51] The Large Hotel | I thought this was entirely temporary (and due to long rest and careful grooming, I had failed to retain this charm and elegance, as well as George's trust, to win over someone more significant), and Steven deeply regretted it.\n[1897-08-27 13:18:56] The Large Hotel | I thought of all the effort I had put in, just to gain the pleasure of knowing Albertine, and Steven also felt deeply regretful.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:01] The Large Hotel | I thought that since this happiness was assured, Steven's reason considered it not precious anymore.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:06] The Large Hotel | I thought, but in Steven's mind, the desire to share this illusion was constant.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:11] The Grand Hotel | I thought of will as the persistent, unchanging servant of Steven's ever-changing, successive personalities. He remained hidden in the shadows, despised, tirelessly loyal. Regardless of how Steven changed from moment to moment, he constantly worked to ensure that Steven never lacked anything essential.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:16] The Large Hotel | When I thought about the long-anticipated journey finally becoming a reality, reason and emotion began to question whether the trip was truly worth taking.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:21] The Large Hotel | I thought that if the trip didn't take place, these idle hosts would immediately find it fascinating, so I let the two hosts go on endlessly at the station, making my decision even more difficult.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:26] The Large Hotel | I thought, but he was in charge of buying the tickets and settling Steven and the others into the compartment according to the departure time.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:31] The Grand Hotel | I thought that just as reason and feeling are fickle, will is eternal and unchanging, but because it remains silent and does not explain its reasons, it seems to have no existence at all.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:36] The Large Hotel | I thought of how the Stevenes, when they clearly distinguished themselves from other parts of Steven, would unknowingly follow a resolute will.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:41] The Large Hotel | I saw when Steven looked at the various useless and fragile decorations in the big wardro be mirror. I found myself engaged in a debate between Steven's sensibility and his reason, arguing over the value of the pleasure derived from meeting Albertine. Perhaps both sensibility and reason wished to preserve these things intact for another occasion.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:46] The Large Hotel | I saw him hand George's address to the coachman. I thought, but Steven's will did not allow the time to go out to pass.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:51] The Grand Hotel | I thought that since the lottery had already been drawn, Steven's reason and emotions now had the leisure to feel sorry about it.\n[1897-08-27 13:19:56] The Large Hotel | I thought that if Steven's wish had been given to another address, Steven's reason and sensibility would probably have been deceived.\n[1897-08-29 04:29:40] At Elstir's house | I saw that after a while, Steven arrived at George's house.\n[1897-08-29 04:29:50] The Elstir's house | I thought that at first, Steven had believed Miss Simone was not in the painting room.\n[1897-08-29 04:29:55] At Elstir's house | I saw that indeed a young girl was sitting there, wearing a silk dress and without a hat on her head.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:10] The Elstir's house | I thought, but she had that hair, that nose, that complexion, Steven didn't recognize her.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:15] the Elstir's house | I thought of Steven's entity, which he had inferred from a girl cycling along the beach, wearing a polo cap, and in these places Steven had not found it.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:20] At Elstir's house | I thought, but she was indeed Albertine.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:25] At Elstir's house | Even after I saw and found out about it, Steven didn't pay much attention to her.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:35] At Elstir's house | I thought of a young man who, upon entering a social gathering, had already experienced the death of his Steven, and had become a completely different person.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:40] At Elstir's house | I thought of the whole salon as a new world, a place where people were governed by different mental laws, completely focused on dancing, card games, and certain people, as if these people and things were of eternal importance to the Stevenes, yet in fact, by the next day, they were completely forgotten.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:45] At Elstir's house | I saw that in order to speak a few words with Albertine, Steven had to take a route that was not at all one he had himself charted.\n[1897-08-29 04:30:55] At Elstir's house | I saw the road first stop in front of George, then pass by several other groups of guests.\n[1897-08-29 04:31:05] The Elstir's house | I saw someone announcing Steven's name to these guests.\n[1897-08-29 04:31:15] The Elstir's house | I saw that the path continued along the cold buffet, where someone brought a strawberry tart to Steven.\n[1897-08-29 04:31:25] At Elstir's house | I watched Steven eat the strawberry tart, listening motionlessly to the music that had just begun.\n[1897-08-29 04:31:35] At Elstir's house | I thought that, for this phase, Steven attached the same importance to introducing Steven to Mademoiselle Ximore as he had to introducing him to Robert.\n[1897-08-29 04:31:40] At Elstir's house | I thought of introducing Steven to her—it was just one phase among many.",

    "text": "[1897-08-29 04:31:45] The Elstir's house | I thought about how, just a few minutes earlier, Steven had completely forgotten the only reason he had come.\n[1897-08-29 04:31:50] The Elstir's house | I thought to myself, isn't it the same in real life, the moments of true happiness for Stevenes and the moments when Stevenes face great misfortunes?\n[1897-08-29 04:31:55] The Elstir's house | I thought of how, among many others, Steven's loved ones had received either the confirming reply Steven had waited a whole year for or the devastating one.\n[1897-08-29 04:32:00] At Elstir's house | I saw it, but I had to keep talking to people. I thought of various ideas that came one after another, forming a surface.\n[1897-08-29 04:32:05] The Elstir's house | I thought that disaster had already fallen upon the Stevenes, this deep and narrow memory, which could only occasionally surface silently beneath the surface.\n[1897-08-29 04:32:10] The Elstir's house | I thought that if it had not been a misfortune, but a great happiness, then perhaps only after several years would the Stevenes have remembered that the most significant event in their emotional lives had actually taken place at a social gathering.\n[1897-08-29 04:32:15] At Elstir's house | I thought that the Stevenes had gone to that social gathering with the expectation of this important event.\n[1897-08-29 04:32:20] At Elstir's house | I thought about it, but at that time, the Stevenes had no time to give this matter prolonged attention, hardly even time to realize its significance.\n[1897-08-30 05:46:53] At Elstir's house | I saw George signaling for Steven to come over so he could introduce Steven to Albertine, who was sitting a bit further away, but Steven first finished a small coffee cream pastry.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:03] At Elstir's house | I saw Steven eagerly asking a senior man he had just met to talk at length to Steven about certain marketplaces in Normandy, and Steven thought he could present this flower to him. I saw the old gentleman greatly admiring the rose on Steven's lapel.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:08] The Elstir's house | I thought that it wasn't that the subsequent introductions did not bring Steven any pleasure; to Steven, the matter did not seem important at all.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:13] At Elstir's house | I thought about happiness, and naturally Steven only felt it later. Some happiness is like taking a photograph: when the person you love is present, you only get a negative, and it's not until you return home and can develop the film in your own darkroom that you finally see the picture.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:18] At Elstir's house | I thought that as long as the house was being kept, the entrance to the darkroom was \"closed.\"\n[1897-08-30 05:47:23] At Elstir's house | I thought about the importance of this introduction, and Steven immediately sensed it, even though Steven felt himself suddenly granted a \"ticket,\" one that would apply to future happiness.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:28] The Elstir's house | I thought that the Stevenes also clearly understood that, for them, obtaining this \"voucher\" did not merely end a long search, but also the existence of a particular person.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:33] The Elstir's house | I thought of this man, whose image had been distorted by Steven's imagination. Steven was anxious, afraid he would never meet Steven, and this only made him seem even more towering.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:38] At Elstir's house | When I heard the name of Steven being loudly announced in the introduction, especially if the speaker, like George, inserted Steven's name into the praises. I thought of the woman whom the Stevenes so eagerly wished to approach, who suddenly vanished.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:43] At Elstir's house | I thought of the conscious gaze that the Stevenes had originally sought, those indistinct thoughts that were instantly and miraculously replaced by the image of the Stevenes themselves, an image that seemed to be painted deep within a smiling mirror.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:48] At Elstir's house | I thought that if the Stevenes themselves were transformed into people who were the least like themselves, this transformation would greatly alter the person who had just been introduced to them, and his shape would become even more indistinct.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:53] The Elstir's house | I thought of the few words the strange girl was about to say to Steven, and how they were as skillful as those of a wax sculptor who could shape a bust in five minutes before Steven's eyes.\n[1897-08-30 05:47:58] The Elstir's house | I thought of these few sentences, which gave this shape a certain decisive quality, sweeping away all the hypotheses that Steven's desires and imagination had conjured up the day before.\n[1897-08-30 05:48:03] At Elstir's house | I knew she was related to Madame Bontemps, which had already limited those beautiful fantasies and blocked one path through which the beautiful fantasies could spread.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:16] The Elstir's house | I thought that as Steven grew closer to the girl and came to know her better, this knowledge would actually be measured in terms of subtraction, with each part of his desire and imagination replaced by a much less valuable perception.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:21] At Elstir's house | I saw Steven standing beside her. I saw Steven again, and he noticed the small beauty mark under her cheek.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:31] At Elstir's house | I heard her say about one person: \"This man is perfectly crazy, but he's still very warm-hearted.\" About another person, she said: \"This gentleman is perfectly ordinary, perfectly boring.\" I thought it was funny that Steven was so surprised when she used the adverb \"perfectly\" instead of \"completely.\"\n[1897-08-31 07:03:36] The house of Elstir | I found the use of the phrase \"perfectly\" unpleasant, but it indicated a person's upbringing and level of culture. Steven really couldn't imagine a prostitute who rode a bicycle, or a muse who drank and played golf, reaching such a level.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:41] At Elstir's house | I thought that at first, Steven found Albertine's expression not defiant at all, but rather timid.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:46] At Elstir's house | I heard her add remarks like \"she has very poor manners\" or \"she looks rather strange\" about every girl Steven had spoken to. I thought that, from this, Steven seemed to find her quite proper rather than unrefined.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:51] At Elstir's house | I saw that one of her temples was very red, which looked uncomfortable; her strange gaze was also unsettling, and even now Steven still cannot forget that look.\n[1897-08-31 07:03:56] At Elstir's house | I thought, but it was impossible to know him, because when Steven and others continually adjusted their perspective of this person, he himself was not a stationary target, but kept changing.\n[1897-08-31 07:04:01] At Elstir's house | I thought that, moving toward things barely visible, toward things we have the time to imagine, this process, no matter how inevitably disappointing it might be, is the only healthy and beneficial one for the senses, the one that keeps a person's appetite alive.\n[1897-08-31 07:04:06] The Large Hotel | I saw Steven return to his lodgings, still thinking about the party. I thought of Steven, who had just eaten a small coffee cream pastry before obediently following George to Albertine's side, and I saw again the rose Steven had given to that old gentleman.\n[1897-08-31 07:04:11] The Large Hotel | I thought of all this, of the details that the Stevenes unconsciously and through circumstances chose, which, for the Stevenes, were carefully and accidentally arranged, forming the picture of their first meeting.\n[1897-08-31 19:01:55] The Large Hotel | I knew that several months later, when Steven spoke to Albertine about the day he first met her, what surprised Steven greatly was that she also mentioned the cream-filled pastries and the flowers Steven had given her.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:15] The Large Hotel | I realized then that Steven had performed a complete transformation, a magic trick in which Steven had spoken for a while with a person who had nothing in common with the girl he had followed so long along the shore, and this person had been replaced by that one.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:20] The Large Hotel | I thought that, despite this, since Steven had identified the girl with Albertine in his conversation with George, he felt a moral obligation toward Albertine to fulfill the promise of love he had made to the imagined Albertine.",

    "text": "[1897-08-31 19:02:25] The Grand Hotel | I thought that, recalling his dignified manner, the phrase \"perfectly commonplace,\" and the fiery temples, was enough to calm Steven's anxieties.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:30] The Large Hotel | I thought that recalling these memories still stirred another desire in Steven's heart, a desire that was sweet and caused no pain, similar to the feeling one has for a sibling. But over time, it became dangerous, making Steven feel at every moment the need to hold this new person in his arms.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:35] The Large Hotel | I thought of the ordinary, touching Albertine whom Steven had spoken to, and then Steven saw the mysterious Albertine across the sea; up until this moment, they were all just memories, just images, and in Steven's eyes, none of these images was any more real than the others.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:40] The Large Hotel | I thought of how, in order to stop thinking about that first evening of introduction and meeting, Steven was again trying hard to catch another glimpse of the little beauty mark under the eyes, on the cheeks.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:45] The Large Hotel | I thought of Steven, who had noticed the mole on Albertine's chin when she left George's house.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:50] The Large Hotel | I thought how Steven must have felt disappointed upon realizing that Miss Simone was almost no different from all the other girls he had known.\n[1897-08-31 19:02:55] The Grand Hotel | I thought to myself that although Albertine herself was not exactly what Steven had hoped for, at least through her he could meet her little group of friends.\n[1897-08-31 19:03:00] Beach | I saw the result: Steven met her every day, and each time she would only greet Steven from a distance. I found it really worrying: if things continued this way, throughout the entire summer, Steven would keep greeting her every day, yet nothing would ever change.\n[1897-09-05 07:58:55] Location: Seawall | I saw a girl approaching Steven on the seawall. I saw one morning, after a rain, that the weather was very cool.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:00] Location: Seawall | I saw her wearing a hat without a brim and a pair of elbow sleeves. I found her so different from the girl I had met at George's party that my mind simply couldn't reconcile the two, and I could not recognize them as the same person.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:05] Location: Seawall | I thought that after a second of surprise, Steven's mind finally caught on. Steven thought that this second of surprise had not escaped Albertine's eyes.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:10] Location: Seawall | I thought of this moment, when Steven recalled the \"proper manners\" that had once impressed him. Now, her rough tone and \"girlie\" behavior shocked Steven in the opposite direction.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:15] Location: Seawall | I thought that, in addition, the temples no longer served as the center of vision on the face, perhaps because Steven was on the other side, or perhaps because the wide-brimmed hat covered the temples, or perhaps because the temples were not always inflamed.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:20] Sea Wall | I heard her say to Steven, \"What kind of weather is this! In any case, the idea that Riverside's summer never ends is pure nonsense!\"\n[1897-09-05 07:59:25] Location: Seawall | \"I heard, 'What, you're doing nothing here! I've never seen you play golf, go to a dance at the casino. You don't even ride horses. You must be so bored!'\"\n[1897-09-05 07:59:30] Seawall | \"I heard him say, 'Don't you think spending all day on the beach makes you go crazy? Ah! Do you like being a lizard? You sure have the time.' Steven noticed that you're different from Steven, because Steven loves all kinds of sports!\"\n[1897-09-05 07:59:35] Dike | \"I heard 'You didn't go to the races at La Sornais, did you? The Marceaux took the train. Steven understands, with a vehicle like that, you wouldn't find it amusing at all! The Marceaux spent two hours on the way! In that time, you could have ridden Steven's old bike back and forth three times!\"\n[1897-09-05 07:59:40] Location: Seawall | I thought about how, because the railway wound so tortuously, Peter naturally called it \"the Nine Bends and Eighteen Turns,\" and Steven had already been very impressed by him. Now, Albertine casually called it \"a rickety old thing,\" which startled Steven again.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:45] Location: Seawall | I thought of Steven, who felt that she was perfectly at ease with her way of speaking, and how Steven was afraid that she might discover he was a complete failure in this area, and thus look down on his incompetence.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:50] Seawall | When I saw Albertine speaking, her head remained still, her nostrils pinched, and only her lips moved, resulting in a drawn-out, nasal tone.\n[1897-09-05 07:59:55] Location: Seawall | I thought the tone was originally likely to be unpleasant, but it had a certain unique charm that fascinated Steven.\n[1897-09-05 08:00:00] Location: Seawall | I saw that morning, the Stevenes formed a pair like that, and Steven carefully observed the moment of stillness. I thought that Steven had finally found out exactly where the beauty mark was.\n[1897-09-05 08:00:05] Location: Seawall | I thought of a passage from Vandeuvre's sonata that had once intoxicated Steven, but in Steven's memory, this passage had wandered uncertainly from the adagio to the rest of the piece until one day, when Steven was holding the score in his hands, he finally found the passage and fixed it in its proper place within his memory, discovering it had actually been in the scherzo.\n[1897-09-05 08:00:10] Seawall | I saw that, and this mole remained forever on the upper lip below my nose. I thought of it in the same way; Steven would recall the beauty mark on his cheek, then remember it was actually on his chin.\n[1897-09-05 13:43:12] Location: Seawall | At that moment, I saw Steven noticing the girlfriends of Albertine, who revealed their presence as a group, with legs that were captivating, slender figures, and each so different from the other.\n[1897-09-05 13:43:27] Seawall | I saw this group of figures growing larger, leaning against the sea, moving in parallel lines toward Steven's group, as if these maidens, bathed in sunlight and sea breeze, adorned with radiant light and glowing with redness, were unfolding beautiful formations, creating a richly varied and decoratively beautiful whole. They would multiply and flourish freely before the sea, changing their shapes endlessly.\n[1897-09-05 13:43:37] Sea Wall | I saw Steven ask Albertine if he could walk with her for a while.\n[1897-09-05 13:43:47] Location: Seawall | I saw it was a pity she only waved at them in greeting.\n[1897-09-05 13:43:52] Sea Wall | I heard Steven say to her, \"If you ignore your friends like that, they'll be upset.\" I thought with a desire that Steven and the others might walk with them.\n[1897-09-05 13:44:02] Location: Seawall | I saw at that moment a well-built young man, holding a racket, walking up to Steven and his friends. I thought he was the one whose absurd behavior while playing cards had greatly angered the wife of the chief judge of the court.\n[1897-09-05 13:44:07] Seawall | I saw him greet Albertine with a cold, indifferent manner. I thought that obviously his self-perceived superiority was expressed in that very look.\n[1897-09-05 13:44:12] Location: Seawall | I heard her ask, \"Ocada, did you come from the golf course? Everything all right? Are you feeling well?\"\n[1897-09-05 13:44:17] Dike | I heard him reply, \"Oh, disgusting, Steven is all dazed.\"\n[1897-09-05 13:44:22] Seawall | I heard, \"Is André here too?\" \"Yes, she hit seventy-seven.\"\n[1897-09-05 13:44:27] Location: Seawall | \"I heard, 'Oh, it's a record!' 'Steven scored eighty-two yesterday!'\"\n[1897-09-05 13:44:47] Location: Seawall | I knew this man was the son of an industrial magnate, and it was said that his father would play a fairly important role in organizing the next World's Fair.\n[1897-09-05 13:44:52] Location: Seawall | I knew this young man, and these few male friends of the girls, who possessed an extraordinary knowledge of everything relating to clothing, dressing, cigars, English beverages, and horses—knowledge that was thorough, comprehensive, and truly admirable. I was surprised by Steven, for these pieces of knowledge, when taken individually, were not accompanied by even the slightest trace of spiritual or cultural refinement.\n[1897-09-05 13:44:57] Location: Seawall | I thought about how suitable he was for a tailcoat or a dressing gown, without the slightest hesitation, yet I couldn't recall in what situations a particular word could be used, and I even failed to understand the simplest French grammar rules.\n[1897-09-06 12:44:19] Location: Seawall | I knew his father was chairman of the Riverside Real Estate Owners' Association, and in a public letter to the voters, there were lines such as, \"Steven had wanted to meet the mayor and discuss this matter with him. He refused to listen to Steven's just complaints.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:44:39] Location: Seawall | I knew that Ondine often won prizes at the fair, in games like Boston, tango, and various other competitions.\n[1897-09-06 12:44:59] Location: Seawall | I saw him say \"excuse me\" to Albertine while lighting a cigar. I thought that was a way of asking the other person's permission to chat while finishing an important task, because he had never been able to \"stay there doing nothing,\" even though in fact he never did anything at all.\n[1897-09-06 12:45:04] Location: Seawall | I thought that if Steven knew the friends of these girls, he would have more chances to meet them, so I immediately prepared to introduce Steven to Octave.\n[1897-09-06 12:45:09] Location: Seawall | I saw John mutter \"Steven is dazed\" as she left, and once she was gone, Steven spoke to Albertine about the thoughts I've just mentioned. I thought that by doing so, Steven would remember it and do the same next time.\n[1897-09-06 12:45:14] Location: Seawall | I saw her scream. I heard, \"But Steven can't introduce you to some slob! There are plenty of people like that here! They can't even have a conversation with you, this one just plays golf well, that's all. Steven knows perfectly well he's not the kind of person you are.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:45:19] Location: Seawall | I heard Steven say to her: \"You've left your girlfriends like this, they must be upset.\" I thought to myself that I hoped she would suggest to Steven that they go after them together.\n[1897-09-06 12:45:24] Location: Seawall | I heard, \"No, they don't need Steven at all.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:45:29] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven and Richard bump into each other, and he gave Steven a clever, meaningful smile.",

    "text": "[1897-09-06 12:45:39] Seawall | I saw that seeing Albertine made him feel awkward again. He made a stiff, repulsive movement, lowering his head toward his collar. I thought about how he didn't know Albertine, or at least only knew of her \"by name and not by sight.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:45:44] Location: Seawall | I heard Albertine ask Steven, \"What's the name of this monster?\" Steven didn't know why he had greeted him, since he didn't even know Steven, so Steven didn't return the greeting.\n[1897-09-06 12:45:49] Sea Wall | I saw Steven unable to answer Albertine's words when Richard had already rushed toward Steven and his group.\n[1897-09-06 12:45:59] Seawall | I heard him say, \"Please forgive Steven for interrupting you, Steven wants to tell you that he's going to East Thierry tomorrow, and he can't wait any longer, it would be impolite to wait any further, what must Peter think of Steven by now! Steven is informing you that he's taking the two o'clock train, please make the arrangements.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:46:04] Location: Seawall | I thought that at this moment Steven was solely focused on meeting Albertine again and trying to get to know her girlfriends, the ones from Eastville, who didn't go there. Steven went, but by the time he returned, he had missed their departure for the beach, so Steven felt that Eastville was the end of the world.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:09] Seawall | I saw Steven tell Richard that Steven couldn't go. I heard him say, \"Well, Steven will go himself. Steven wants to quote two funny Alexandrine lines from M. Alouette to Peter: You must know, Steven's duty doesn't depend on his duty; if he wants, he can avoid it, but Steven should fulfill Steven's duty, in order to provoke his ultramontanism.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:46:14] Location: Seawall | I heard Albertine say to Steven, \"Steven admits he's a rather good-looking fellow, but he really makes Steven sick!\"\n[1897-09-06 12:46:19] Seawall | I thought Steven had never imagined that Richard could be handsome, but he actually was. His head was somewhat round, his nose was hooked like an eagle's, and his expression was very refined, showing a confident awareness of his own elegance. His face was pleasant to look at.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:24] Seawall | I thought that he wouldn't be liked by Albertine, perhaps because of Albertine's own faults, because of the rigidity and insensitivity of this little group, because of their brutality toward anything outside their circle.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:29] Seawall | I later thought that when Steven introduced them, Albertine's dislike of Richard only grew stronger.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:34] Location: Seawall | I thought that Richard belonged to a certain social class, one in which on the one hand it freely slandered the upper class, and on the other hand showed full respect for the proper manners of a man \"with clean hands,\" resulting in a particularly peculiar compromise that was neither quite like the manners of the upper class nor, in any case, failed to display an especially repulsive form of social politeness.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:39] Location: Seawall | I thought of how, when people introduced him to others, he would bow slightly, smiling with a touch of suspicion and excessive politeness.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:44] Location: Seawall | I thought that if the other person were a man, he would always say, \"Sir, it's an honor.\" His voice seemed to mock the words he was saying, yet at the same time, he was aware that this voice belonged to someone not brutal.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:49] Location: Seawall | I thought of that first second, which he used on a habit he both followed and mocked, then he would look clever and sly, and \"loudly utter very subtle things,\" things that often contained truth, but which Albertine could not stand.\n[1897-09-06 12:46:54] Seawall | The first day I saw Steven tell her his name was Richard, she screamed. I heard \"Steven could bet, he's a Jewish devil, putting on polite manners, just their usual trick.\"\n[1897-09-06 12:46:59] Location: Seawall | I thought that, in addition, Richard probably later annoyed Albertine in another way, just as many intellectuals do; he never simply said something straightforward, but instead sought a refined adjective for everything, then generalized it broadly.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:04] Seawall | I thought of how Albertine would hate this, for she didn't like being meddled with, and she didn't like it when she had sprained her ankle and was quietly resting, the words that Richard had said.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:09] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven part from Albertine, promising each other to go on a trip together. I thought Steven had spoken to her, but I didn't know where Steven's words had fallen, nor what effect they might have had, as if I didn't know whether Steven had thrown a stone into an abyss with no bottom.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:14] Location: Seawall | I thought that, in general, the people who listened to Steven's words would fill those words with meaning drawn from their essential content, and this meaning was quite different from the one Steven himself gave to his words.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:19] Location: Seawall | I thought even further: if someone were right there beside a person, and the Stevenes found that person's education unimaginable (as Albertine's education was to Steven), and didn't understand his tastes, the books he read, or his principles, then the Stevenes wouldn't know whether what they said to him would awaken any feeling at all.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:24] Location: Seawall | I thought it was more like trying to evoke a certain feeling in an animal, since animals can still be made to understand certain things.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:29] Seawall | I thought that, therefore, I tried to develop a deep relationship with Albertine, which, in Steven's view, seemed like contacting an unknown quantity, if not an impossible one.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:34] Seawall | I thought that it must be just as difficult as breaking a horse, just as laborious as beekeeping or growing roses.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:39] Location: Seawall | I thought of Steven making a promise to himself in his heart, that the next time he saw Albertine, he would be bolder with her.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:44] Location: Seawall | I thought about what Steven was going to say to her, even (since Steven had probably formed a very frivolous impression of her) what he would ask her for pleasure, and Steven had already worked out every detail in advance.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:49] Seawall | I thought that human thoughts, like plants, like cells, like chemical elements, can be influenced.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:54] Location: Sea Wall | I thought that if one delves deeply into an environment, then changing the environment of thought is called situation, a new environment.\n[1897-09-06 12:47:59] Location: Seawall | I thought about how when Steven was once again with Albertine, the mere fact of her presence made Steven different from usual, so that what he said to her had nothing in common with what he had previously planned to say.\n[1897-09-06 12:48:04] Location: Seawall | I thought then, and Steven recalled his inflamed temple, and Steven again asked himself whether Albertine might have preferred another kind of attentiveness, and whether she would have understood it as being without any ulterior motive.\n[1897-09-06 12:48:09] Location: Seawall | I thought that in the face of certain glances, certain smiles, Steven felt embarrassed; these glances and smiles could either mean flirtatiousness or the happiness of a lively but virtuous young girl.\n[1897-09-06 12:48:14] Location: Seawall | I thought about how the same expression on the face and the same way of speaking could have different meanings, and Steven was as hesitant as a student struggling with the difficulties of a Latin translation exercise.\n[1897-09-07 21:33:30] Dike | I saw it that time, and Steven and the others almost immediately encountered the tall girl, Andre, the one who had jumped from the chief judge's bench.",

    "text": "[1897-09-07 21:33:40] Location: Seawall | I saw Albertine forced to introduce Steven to André. I saw her girlfriend's eyes were extremely clear and bright, as if she had walked from a room shaded by greenery into a bedroom that faced the sunlight and the greenish gleam of the sunlit sea through an open door.\n[1897-09-07 21:33:50] Location: Seawall | I saw five men walk by. I thought about how, since Steven had come to Riverside, I had often seen them and found them very familiar, and Steven often wondered in his mind who they were.\n[1897-09-07 21:33:55] Location: Seawall | I heard Albertine, her face filled with scorn, mock Steven by saying, \"They're not really rich people.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:00] Seawall | I heard, \"That balding old man with the dyed hair, wearing yellow gloves, he's quite good-looking, isn't he? He makes a lot of funny faces. He's the dentist from Riverside, and he's an honest man.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:05] Location: Seawall | I heard, \"That fat man is the mayor. Not that little short one. That little short one, you've probably met him, he's a dance instructor.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:10] Location: Seawall | I heard him say, \"He's really ugly, and he can't stand the Stevenes because they're too noisy at the fair. They either break the chairs or try to dance without the carpet, so he never lets the Stevenes win, even though only the Stevenes know how to dance.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:15] Sea Wall | I heard someone say, \"The dentist is an honest man. Steven should have greeted them just to make that dance instructor furious, but it wasn't possible because Monsieur de Peter was with them. This Peter was the chairman, from a noble family, but for money, his family had taken a side with the Republicans.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:20] Location: Seawall | I heard that \"no honest person would greet him; because of the cabinet, he knew Steven's uncle, but the rest of Steven's family ignored him.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:25] Location: Seawall | I heard someone say, \"That thin man in the raincoat is the orchestra conductor. What! You don't know him? He plays the piano like heavenly music. You didn't go to hear Cavalleria Rusticana. Oh! Steven thought it was absolutely perfect! He's giving a concert tonight, but the Stevenes can't go because the concert is being held at the town hall.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:30] Seawall | \"I heard, 'It's not related to the fair, but if Steven and his friends go to the town hall where they've taken down the Christ figure, Robert might have a stroke!'\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:35] Location: Seawall | \"I heard, 'You'll tell Steven that Steven's uncle also holds a position in the government! But what can be done? An aunt is an aunt, and that doesn't mean Steven has to like her! She's always had only one wish, which was to get rid of Steven!\"\n[1897-09-07 21:34:40] Location: Seawall | I heard that the one who truly acted as Steven's mother, and who gained double merit for it, was a girlfriend, since she had no blood relation to Steven at all. Steven loved her just as much as he loved Robert, and later Steven will show you her photo.\n[1897-09-07 21:34:45] Breakwater | I saw that the golf champion and the man who played Baccarat, Octave, came over to speak with Steven and his friends.\n[1897-09-07 21:34:55] Location: Seawall | I thought that Steven believed he had discovered a connection between himself and the others, because from the conversation Steven learned that he was somewhat related to the Verdurins and was quite beloved by them.\n[1897-09-07 21:35:00] Seawall | I saw him, but when he spoke of the famous Wednesday, he added with complete contempt. I heard someone say, \"Mr. Verdurin doesn't even know how to wear a tailcoat; it's embarrassing to run into him at some of those vaudeville theaters.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:35:05] Dike | I heard him say, \"In a place like that, I really don't like hearing a man in a usual suit, with a black tie, looking like a country notary, shouting at you, 'Hello, mischievous child!'\"\n[1897-09-07 21:35:10] Location: Seawall | I saw later that Octave left the group of Steven.\n[1897-09-07 21:35:20] Location: Seawall | I saw them after a while; Steven ran into André again, and they walked a bit together. She didn't say a word to Steven, and when they reached her wooden villa, she went inside.\n[1897-09-07 21:35:30] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven trying to get Albertine's attention, how indifferent her girlfriend was to Steven. I thought about how Steven found it difficult to establish a close relationship between himself and Albertine, and how George seemed to have encountered hostility from the very first day in his attempt to fulfill Steven's expectations.\n[1897-09-07 21:35:35] Location: Seawall | I saw this just as some young girls passed by. These were the ladies from the Ambresac family. Steven greeted them, and Albertine also said hello. I thought of this situation, which made Steven feel even more regretful about André's departure.\n[1897-09-07 21:35:40] Location: Seawall | I thought to myself, Steven, in his relationship with Albertine, was about to see his position improve.\n[1897-09-07 21:35:45] Seawall | I knew these young ladies were the daughters of a relative of Charles, who also knew Madame de Luxembourg.\n[1897-09-07 21:36:05] Location: Seawall | I knew the Durand-Debussy couple were very wealthy, owning a small villa in Riverside, but they lived the most modest life; the husband always wore the same jacket, and the wife always dressed in a dark long dress.\n[1897-09-07 21:36:25] Location: Seawall | I knew that the couple always greeted Steven's grandmother respectfully, but without any ulterior motive.\n[1897-09-07 21:36:45] Seawall | I saw my daughters, naturally beautiful and dressed in more elaborate clothes, but it was the elegance of the city, not the seaside (they wore long dresses and large straw hats). I thought that, compared to Albertine, that sort of person belonged to another human society.\n[1897-09-07 21:36:50] Location: Seawall | I thought about how Steven had realized that Albertine knew perfectly well who they were.\n[1897-09-07 21:36:55] Location: Seawall | I heard her say, \"Ah! You know the girl from the Ambresac family? Hey, you really do know some wonderful people! But they're very plain.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:37:00] Location: Seawall | I heard, \"These girls are nice to people, but they're so strictly chaperoned, they aren't allowed to go to the amusement parks, mainly because of the Stevenes, the Stevenes are such a disgrace.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:37:05] Location: Seawall | \"I heard, 'Do these girls please you? Oh, who knows, they're all little white geese. May be they have their own charm, if you like little white geese, you've certainly gotten what you wanted.'\"\n[1897-09-07 21:37:10] Sea Wall | I heard, \"It seems they are likable, since one of them is already engaged to the Marquis de Peter, and the younger one has fallen in love with this young man, which must be quite painful for her.\"\n[1897-09-07 21:37:15] Location: Seawall | \"I heard 'Steven, the way they talk with their lips hardly moving is enough to make Steven sick, and their clothes are really funny too—silk dresses for golf! Such young girls dressed more self-importantly than some well-dressed older women, like Mrs. George, who really knows how to dress!'”\n[1897-09-07 21:37:20] Location: Seawall | I saw Albertine laugh when she heard that. I heard Steven answer, and it seemed to me that Steven thought Madame George was dressed much more simply.\n[1897-09-07 21:37:25] Location: Seawall | I heard, \"She does dress very simply, but she makes you feel happy just by how she's dressed. She spends a lot of money to achieve the simplicity you think she has!\"\n[1897-09-08 22:10:43] Seawall | I thought of Madame George's long dress, which would not have attracted attention in the eyes of someone without a grounded and simple sense of fashion, a sense that Steven lacked.\n[1897-09-08 22:10:48] Seawall | I knew, according to Albertine's view, that George possessed this aesthetic sense, and had reached the highest degree of it.

I knew that George was so particular that he thought all women were badly dressed.\n[1897-09-08 22:11:18] Seawall | I knew he placed the greatest emphasis on proportions and subtle differences, spending a great deal of money to have his wife's parasols, hats, and coats made.\n[1897-09-08 22:11:38] Location: Seawall | I knew he had taught Albertine to appreciate the charm of these things. I thought of someone without an aesthetic sense, who would not pay more attention to these things than Steven.\n[1897-09-08 22:11:43] Location: Seawall | I knew that in addition, Albertine had dabbled a bit in painting, although she herself admitted she had no \"talent,\" and she worshipped George completely.\n[1897-09-08 22:12:03] Location: Seawall | I knew that thanks to George's words and the things he showed her, she had become quite adept at appreciating paintings. I thought of how this contrasted sharply with her passion for \"Cavalleria Rusticana.\"\n[1897-09-08 22:12:08] Seawall | I thought it was because, although it wasn't very noticeable yet, she was actually very intelligent. The foolishness in her conversation wasn't due to her own stupidity, but rather to her environment and her age.\n[1897-09-08 22:12:13] Location: Seawall | I thought George had a good influence on her, but it was only partial.\n[1897-09-08 22:12:18] Location: Seawall | I thought that not all forms of intelligence had reached the same level of development in Albertine; her ability to appreciate painting was almost as developed as her appreciation for clothing and all the various refined and luxurious forms, but her ability to appreciate music lagged far behind.\n[1897-09-08 22:12:23] Location: Seawall | After Steven had bowed to each of the ladies in the house, I didn't feel that Albertine was any more eager than before to introduce Steven to her girlfriends. I realized it was useless to think that Albertine knew what the Ambroise family was like, just as a person who can do great things is not necessarily able to do small ones.\n[1897-09-08 22:12:28] Dike | I heard, \"You value them a lot, you have a kind heart, but don't pay attention to them, they're not worth it.\"\n[1897-09-08 22:12:33] Location: Seawall | I heard him say, \"What are these girls to a man of your standing? At least Andréa is intelligent, she's a kind girl, though she's completely lost in her fantasies. The others, on the other hand, are truly stupid.\"\n[1897-09-08 22:12:38] Location: Sea Wall | I saw Albertine leave. I thought of Steven, who suddenly felt a pang of sorrow because Peter had kept his engagement secret from him, and because he was about to commit such a wrong as marrying his mistress without having broken off with her.\n[1897-09-09 14:34:58] Beach | I saw that a few days later, Steven was introduced to André.\n[1897-09-13 07:59:30] Beach | I had listened to her for a long time, and Steven took the opportunity to say to her, \"Steven would like to see her again the next day.\" But she replied to Steven that it was not possible, because her Robert was very ill, and she didn't want to leave Robert alone at home.\n[1897-09-13 07:59:35] Elstir's studio | Two days later, I saw Steven visit George. I heard him say to Steven that André had a great liking for Steven.\n[1897-09-13 07:59:40] Elstir's studio | I heard Steven answer him: \"It was Steven who had taken a liking to her from the very first day. Steven asked to meet her again the next day, but she couldn't come.\"\n[1897-09-13 07:59:45] Elstir's Studio | I heard George say to Steven, \"Yes, Steven knows, she told Steven, she's very sorry about it, but she had already promised to go on a picnic ten miles away, and she has to take a four-wheeled carriage, so she can't cancel the invitation anymore.\"\n[1897-09-13 07:59:50] Elstir's Studio | I thought that Andre was completely unaware of Steven, and although this lie was trivial, someone who would do such a thing was certainly not someone Steven should continue to associate with.\n[1897-09-13 07:59:55] Elstir's studio | I thought that Steven would be able to do it the first time, and also many times again, just like going to see a friend every year, and each time he would fail to come because of a cold, which he himself thought was a different reason, made up on the spot according to the situation.\n[1897-09-13 08:00:00] Location: Seawall | After the morning when I saw Andre on the day he told Steven that she had to stay by Robert's side, another morning came, and Steven saw from a distance that Albertine was holding a piece of silk rope with a strange object hanging from it.\n[1897-09-13 22:13:35] Location: Seawall | I knew this object was called \"the little devil,\" and it had long been discontinued. I thought she resembled the painting of \"The Worship of the Idol\" by Giotto.\n[1897-09-13 22:13:40] Seawall | I thought of Steven imagining the portrait of the young girl holding this object, and how future critics would be able to write long essays about the object in her hand, just as they would about the allegorical painting in the cathedral of Chartres.\n[1897-09-13 22:13:45] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven and Albertine walk a few steps, and a little while later, their poor-looking, severe-faced girlfriend came over. I heard her say to Albertine, \"Hello, Steven, are you bothering you?\"\n[1897-09-13 22:13:50] Location: Seawall | I knew she was the girl who had maliciously mocked, \"Poor old fellow, it really makes Steven feel bad,\" when André first strode past the old man's head on the first day.\n[1897-09-13 22:14:10] Location: Seawall | I saw that the hat was in the way, so she took it off. I saw her hair, like a variety of colorful but nameless flowers, spreading out and elegantly and skillfully resting on her forehead.\n[1897-09-13 22:14:20] Location: Seawall | I saw her remain silent, saying not a word, keeping a cold, unyielding silence. I thought Albertine probably saw her with her head uncovered, and I was angry.\n[1897-09-13 22:14:25] Seawall | Even so, the girl remained, and Albertine always told her to keep a distance from Steven. Now she would try to be alone with her, now she would try to go off with Steven, leaving her behind.\n[1897-09-13 22:14:35] Location: Seawall | I saw that Steven had to ask Albertine in front of the girl to introduce him to her.\n[1897-09-13 22:14:45] Sea Wall | I saw Albertine utter Steven's name. I saw, in an instant, Steven see a flicker of warmth and loving smile on the girl's face and in her blue eyes.\n[1897-09-13 22:14:55] Dike | I saw her reach out her hand to Steven. I thought of it, and when she said, \"Poor old fellow, it really makes Steven feel bad,\" Steven felt that her expression was so cruel!\n[1897-09-13 22:15:00] Location: Seawall | I saw her hair shining with golden light, and not only her hair, but her pink cheeks and blue eyes also seemed to sparkle with golden light all over, like the sky at dawn when the morning haze turns red.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:15] Location: Seawall | I thought, and suddenly Steven's whole body grew hot; I secretly thought to myself that this was a girl who was very shy when in love.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:20] Location: Seawall | I thought about Albertine's brutal and rude behavior, yet she remained, for Steven, out of love for Steven.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:25] Location: Seawall | I thought of Steven, who felt that she at last could with a smiling, kind look confess to Steven that she could be very gentle with him and yet very harsh with others, and that she was probably very happy about it.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:30] Location: Seawall | I thought that even before Steven had known her, she must have already noticed him on the beach, and from that moment on, she had been thinking of Steven.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:35] Location: Seawall | I thought that perhaps she had laughed at the old gentleman in order to make Steven admire her; perhaps later, when she seemed melancholy, it was because she couldn't meet Steven.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:40] Location: Seawall | I thought about the evening, and how Steven often saw her walking on the beach from the hotel, and she probably hoped to meet Steven.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:45] Sea Wall | I thought that just as before, when the whole little group was present and she felt embarrassed, now, with only Albertine present, she also felt embarrassed.",

    "text": "[1897-09-13 22:15:50] Location: Seawall | I thought that although Albertine's attitude was growing increasingly cold, she still never let go of Steven and his friends. Obviously, she was hoping to stay until the end, arrange a meeting with Steven, find a time when she could slip away without her family or her girlfriend finding out, and meet Steven at a reliable place either before Mass or after playing golf.\n[1897-09-13 22:15:55] Seawall | I thought that because Andre had a bad relationship with her and hated her, it would be extremely difficult to meet her.\n[1897-09-13 22:16:00] Location: Seawall | I later heard Andre saying to Steven: \"Steven had beenendureting for a long time at her terrible hypocrisy and meanness, and at the despicable things she did to Steven. For others, Steven endured everything, but finally, Steven couldendure no longer.\"\n[1897-09-13 22:16:05] Location: Seawall | I saw that she told Steven about the commotion the girl had caused. I thought that this matter could indeed damage André's reputation.\n[1897-09-13 22:16:10] Seawall | I saw that Héloïse, with her expressive looks, was hoping that Albertine would bring the Stevenes together so she could speak to Steven. But she never managed to say anything, because Albertine stubbornly remained between the two Stevenes, answering her girlfriend more and more briefly, and later simply stopped replying to her altogether.\n[1897-09-14 23:05:51] Location: Seawall | I saw that Hessel finally had to give up the position.\n[1897-09-14 23:06:01] Location: Seawall | I saw Steven scolding Albertine for being so difficult.\n[1897-09-14 23:06:11] Location: Seawall | I heard them say, \"Teach her a lesson, make her be more careful. She's not a bad girl, but she's annoying. There's no need for her to meddle everywhere. Nobody asked her to come, so why does she stick to Steven like this? In five more minutes Steven will tell her to get lost! And besides, look at the way she's dressed—Steven hates it, it looks improper.\"\n[1897-09-14 23:06:16] Location: Seawall | When I saw Albertine speaking to Steven, Steven was gazing at her cheeks. I thought to myself: How sweet, how delicious her face would be!\n[1897-09-14 23:06:21] Location: Seawall | I saw that day, her cheeks were not bright red, but smooth and uniformly pink, slightly tinged with purple, like cream, as if some roses had a waxy coating on their petals.\n[1897-09-14 23:06:36] Seawall | I thought of how, just as some people are passionately devoted to a particular kind of flower, Steven was utterly infatuated with those cheeks.\n[1897-09-14 23:06:41] Seawall | I heard Steven answer her: \"Steven had never noticed her before.\"\n[1897-09-14 23:06:46] Location: Seawall | I heard her say to Steven, \"You're looking at her very carefully today, it's almost as if you want to paint her portrait!\"\n[1897-09-14 23:06:51] Location: Seawall | I thought that Steven was now looking at her with utmost attention, but this did not calm her down at all.\n[1897-09-14 23:06:56] Seawall | I heard, \"But Steven doesn't think she'll be to your liking. She doesn't know how to flirt at all. You probably like girls who know how to flirt, don't you? Anyway, she'll never get the chance to be clingy again, nor to have someone brush her off. She's leaving for Willowbrook right away.\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:01] Dike | I heard, \"Are your other girlfriends going with her too?\" \"No, just her alone.\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:06] Location: Seawall | I heard, \"She and Miss, because she has to retake the exam, she'll have to study hard, this poor child, Steven assures you, it's not a pleasant thing at all.\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:11] Seawall | I heard, \"You might run into a great topic, the randomness is too big. Steven's girlfriend once got the question 'Descri be an accident you witnessed,' hey, that was really good luck!\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:16] Location: Seawall | I heard him say, \"But Steven also knows a girl who has to write an essay—on the topic: 'Between Alcandre and Philinte, whom would you prefer as a friend?'\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:21] Location: Seawall | \"I heard someone say, 'If Steven were faced with this topic, he'd be completely flustered. First of all, not to mention anything, but it's simply not appropriate to ask girls such questions. Girls should be close to other girls, not think that they should find male friends.'\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:26] Seawall | I thought of saying this to Steven, indicating that the chances of him being accepted into that little group were slim, and it would make Steven shudder all over.\n[1897-09-14 23:07:31] Location: Seawall | \"I heard him say, 'But regardless, even if you asked some young people this question, what could they possibly say? Several parents have written letters to the Gazette des Écoles, complaining that these kinds of topics are too difficult.'\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:36] Location: Seawall | I heard him say, \"What's even more absurd is that in a collection of award-winning student essays, this topic was done twice, and the approaches were completely opposite—everything depended on the examiner.\"\n[1897-09-14 23:07:41] Dike | I heard someone say that one examiner wanted the answer to be that Philinte was a social butterfly, a sycophant, and a fraud; while the other examiner wanted the answer to be that one couldn't help but praise Alcandre, but since he was too quarrelsome and had such a bad temper, it was better to choose Philinte as a friend.\n[1897-09-14 23:07:46] Seawall | I heard him say, \"If even the teachers can't agree, how can you expect the poor students to figure it out? And that's not all—the problems are getting harder every year. Hessel might not be able to pass without some backdoor help.\"\n[1897-09-15 07:59:10] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven return to the hotel, but David was not there. Steven had been waiting for her for a long time.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:15] Balbec Hotel | I waited for her to return, and Steven begged her to let Steven go on a trip, which had very good conditions, and the time would be about forty-eight hours.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:20] Balbec Hotel | I saw my grandmother for lunch, called a carriage, and ordered it to take Steven to the train station.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:25] Carriage | I thought that Hessel would not be surprised to see Steven at the station.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:30] Carriage | I thought about Steven wanting to stay with the Stevenets on the train to Willowbrook, which had a private compartment.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:35] Carriage | I thought that when Miss was dozing off, Steven could take Hélsie to a quiet corner and make an appointment with her for after he returned to Willowbrook, and Steven tried to get back to Willowbrook as quickly as possible.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:40] Carriage | I thought that, according to her wishes as she had expressed them to Steven, perhaps Steven would take her all the way to Gacé or Évreux, and then take the next train back.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:45] Carriage | I thought, but what would she think if she found out that Steven had long been torn between her and her girlfriend, wanting to be faithful to her, yet also wanting to be faithful to Albertine, to the girl with the bright eyes, and to Unknown_Rosemonde!\n[1897-09-15 07:59:50] In the carriage | I thought that since Steven and John were in love and about to be united, he must certainly feel deep remorse for the things that had happened.\n[1897-09-15 07:59:55] In the carriage | I thought that after all, Steven could solemnly assure her that Steven no longer loved Albertine.\n[1897-09-15 08:00:00] Carriage | I saw this morning that Steven turned his head away from her, just so he could speak with Céline.\n[1897-09-15 22:56:46] Carriage | I saw that on her pouting head, the hair at the back was different from the rest, darker in color and shining as if she had just emerged from water.\n[1897-09-15 22:57:01] Carriage | I thought of it as making Steven think of a drowned rat, and such hair made Steven see another expression of the soul in Albertine, completely different from her previously somewhat purple face and mysterious gaze.\n[1897-09-15 22:57:06] Carriage | I saw the shining hair at the back of her head. I thought that for a while, what Steven could see in her was only this, and what Steven continued to see was only this.\n[1897-09-15 22:57:11] In the carriage | I thought that Steven had always believed she was on terrible terms with Héloïse, so when she said these words, Steven was truly astonished.\n[1897-09-15 22:57:16] Carriage | I saw Andre turn toward Steven and added something. I heard, \"Clearly you don't think she's particularly outstanding, but she's a very honest girl, and Steven is very fond of her.\"\n[1897-09-15 22:57:21] Carriage | I thought that Steven had thus concluded that Andre had been at odds with people for only a short time.",

I knew that on days other than rainy ones, the Stevenes would ride their bicycles up to the cliffs or into the countryside.\n[1897-09-16 13:26:51] Balbec Hotel | I saw that if Françoise didn't have Steven's clothes ready, Steven would start grumbling.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:01] Balbec Hotel | I thought of Françoise, who was humble, modest, and lovely when she felt her self-esteem was satisfied by praise.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:06] Balbec Hotel | I saw it, but even if you pointed out the slightest fault in her, she would straighten her back proudly and angrily, even in Willowbrook—old age was already beginning to bend her.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:16] Balbec Hotel | I thought that this sense of pride was the main spring in her life, and her feelings of satisfaction and happiness were proportional to the difficulty of the tasks she had to perform.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:21] Balbec Hotel | I saw that she almost always wore an unhappy expression. I thought of all the things she would do in Riverside, and they all seemed so easy.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:26] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven going to meet his girlfriend, complaining about Steven's hat not being brushed or Steven's tie not being properly arranged. I would see her ill-humored expression suddenly multiplied a hundredfold, along with a look of scornful mockery.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:36] Balbec Hotel | I thought that before, she could go through great difficulties without considering what she had done as anything particularly remarkable. But now, all it takes is pointing out that a jacket is not where it should be, and she not only boasts about how carefully she has \"stored\" the jacket instead of letting it gather dust outside, but also feels compelled to praise her own work, complaining that in Riverside she wasn't on vacation, and that no one else here lives quite like she does.\n[1897-09-16 13:27:41] Balbec Hotel | I heard \"Steven really doesn't know how he can leave his things in such a mess. Go and take a look—would anyone else be able to find a clue in all this chaos? Even the devil himself would probably get lost.\"\n[1897-09-16 13:27:46] Hotel Balbec | I saw her either glaring furiously at Steven in silence. I saw her take on the face of a queen.\n[1897-09-16 23:48:32] Corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I saw her, but as soon as the door closed and we entered the corridor, her silence was immediately broken, and her words echoed through the corridor. I thought Steven was making an insult, but it was also like the first few lines spoken by the characters before they entered the stage, so unclear to understand.\n[1897-09-16 23:48:37] Balbec Hotel | I thought that even if Steven was dressed and ready to go out with his girlfriends, and even if he had everything he needed, if Françoise was in a good mood, she would still behave in a way that was unbearable.\n[1897-09-17 00:50:48] Balbec Hotel | I had seen Steven make some joking remarks about these girls in front of her. I knew that when Steven felt a need to talk about these girls, he would want to speak to someone.\n[1897-09-17 00:50:58] Balbec Hotel | I saw that now, she used these jests to pretend to be about to reveal something to Steven. I thought that, if it were true, Steven surely knew it better than she did.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:03] Balbec Hotel | I thought she didn't understand at all, because she hadn't grasped what Steven had said.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:08] Balbec Hotel | I thought that, like all people, she had her own temperament, and in people, such a temperament never follows a straight path, but instead astonishes us with its strange and inevitable twists and turns.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:13] Balbec Hotel | I thought that others would not notice these detours, and that Stevens would have to walk through them, which would be very difficult.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:18] Balbec Hotel | I thought about how every time Steven reached the point where it said \"the hat is not where it should be,\" and \"the name of André or Albertine,\" Françoise would force Steven to take a winding, nonsensical path, preventing him from moving forward.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:23] Balbec Hotel | When I saw Steven ordering a sandwich with cheddar and lettuce, and asking for some snacks, it was the same. I knew it was time for tea, the time when Steven and these girls had their tea on the cliff.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:33] Balbec Hotel | I saw, but Françoise claimed that if they hadn't been so concerned with material interests, they could have taken turns paying.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:43] Balbec Hotel | I thought that the entire regressive phenomenon of greed and vulgarity from the provinces had come to save Françoise.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:48] Hotel Balbec | I thought that, in her eyes, one might say the fragmented soul of the deceased Aline found a more beautiful incarnation in the attractive bodies of Steven's girlfriend and her little group than on Peter.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:53] Balbec Hotel | I thought of the accusations Steven would hear, and he was truly furious, feeling as though he had run into a place where, from here on, the familiar country paths had turned into dead ends that could not be passed.\n[1897-09-17 00:51:58] Balbec Hotel | I thought, thank goodness the time wasn't long, this familiar country path was just like Françoise's character.\n[1897-09-17 14:19:07] Balbec | I saw later, when the jacket was found and the sandwich was prepared, Steven went to look for Albertine, Andre, Unknown_Rosemonde, sometimes others.\n[1897-09-17 14:19:17] Balbec | I saw them, and the Stevenes set off, on foot or by bicycle.\n[1897-09-17 14:19:27] Balbec | I thought that if it had been earlier, Steven might have preferred to take a walk when the weather was bad.\n[1897-09-17 14:19:32] Balbec | I thought about that time when Steven was desperately trying to rediscover the \"homeland of the Simerians\" in Riverside. At that time, probably there was no such thing as fine weather; the good times were when people taking sea baths in an old, mist-veiled region during an ordinary summer.\n[1897-09-17 14:19:37] Balbec | I thought that now, Steven had passionately pursued everything he had once scorned and avoided in his field of vision—not just the play of sunlight, but even boat races and horse races.\n[1897-09-17 14:19:42] Balbec | I realized that the reason I once only wanted to see the sea swept by a storm was related to aesthetic notions, just like with Steven.\n[1897-09-17 19:30:02] Elstir's Studio | I saw that because Steven sometimes visited George with his girlfriends.\n[1897-09-17 19:30:12] Elstir's studio | When the girls were present, he preferred to show them the sketches of a pretty girl driving a speedboat or a rough drawing from a racetrack near Riverside.\n[1897-09-17 19:30:22] Elstir's Studio | I saw Steven first timidly acknowledge George. I heard that Steven used to refuse to attend those kinds of gatherings.\n[1897-09-17 19:30:27] Elstir's Studio | I heard him say to Steven, \"You're wrong, it was so beautiful, and so strange!\"\n[1897-09-17 19:30:32] Elstir's studio | \"I heard, 'First, that special figure, the rider, everyone's eyes were fixed on him! He wore a bright and dazzling silk jacket, in front of the riding school, his expression gloomy, his face pale, merged as one with the horse he was tightly holding, which was prancing and leaping.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:30:37] Elstir's studio | \"I found it fascinating to analyze the professional nature of his movements, which formed a sparkling highlight—how interesting it would be! On the racetrack, the jockey's silks also formed a sparkling highlight!\"\n[1897-09-17 19:30:42] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"What changes have taken place on this dazzling, vast expanse of the racetrack! Shadows, reflections, so many of them—just seeing this is astonishing!\"\n[1897-09-17 19:30:47] Elstir's Studio | I heard him say, \"How beautiful a woman can be on the racetrack! Especially at the first one, it's really exhilarating!\"\n[1897-09-17 19:30:52] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"In that kind of damp light like in the Netherlands, I felt the bone-chilling cold of the sea rising in the sunlight, and there were also women dressed in extremely elaborate attire.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:30:57] Elstir's Studio | I heard him say, \"This light probably comes from the dampness of the seashore. Steven has never seen a woman in such sunlight, arriving in a carriage or holding a telescope to her eye. Ah! How much Steven would like to capture this sunlight!\"",

    "text": "[1897-09-17 19:31:02] Elstir's studio | I heard him say, \"Steven came back from the horse races as if he'd gone mad, with such a strong desire to work!\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:07] Elstir's studio | I saw him then, praising the yacht regatta with even more enthusiasm than he did the horse races.\n[1897-09-17 19:31:17] Elstir's Studio | I thought, and so Steven understood: the race of the elegantly dressed woman bathing in the sea-blue sunlight of the seaside racetrack, the sporting event—could be just as interesting a subject for a contemporary artist as the festivals so beloved by painters like Veronese or Capaccio.\n[1897-09-17 19:31:22] Elstir's Studio | I heard George say to Steven, \"The city where they paint has festivals that have a maritime aspect, so your metaphor is even more accurate.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:27] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"It was the beauty of that era, which often lay in its weight and complexity, with naval tournaments, just like here, usually held to entertain a diplomat, similar to how Capaccio depicted the legend of Saint Ursula.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:32] Elstir's Studio | I heard the words, \"The ship was huge, built like a building, seemingly amphibious, like a tiny Oakdale within the city of Oakdale.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:37] Elstir's studio | I heard, \"The vessel moored with the aid of a movable bridge covered with deep red velvet and Persian carpets.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:42] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"Just beside the balcony inlaid with various marbles, women in cherry-red brocade or green floral silk boarded the boat.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:47] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"Above the balcony, other women in black-sleeved white gowns, decorated with pearls or edged with lace, leaned out to look.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:52] Elstir's Studio | I heard \"people no longer know where the land ends and the sea begins, what a palace or a boat is, a small sailboat, a Venetian gondola, and a decorated boat.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:31:57] Elstir's Studio | I saw how George described these costume details to Steven, and how Albertine listened with rapt attention and great interest.\n[1897-09-17 19:32:07] Elstir's Studio | I saw her scream. \"I heard, 'Ah, Steven would love to see the lace you mentioned, the Oakdale lace, it's so beautiful! Steven really wants to go to Oakdale!'\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:12] Elstir's Studio | I heard George say to her, \"Perhaps soon you will be able to admire the wonderful fabrics people used to wear there, which can now only be seen in the paintings of the Venetian school, or rarely in the treasures of a church, and sometimes even a piece of such fabric is put up for sale.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:17] Elstir's studio | I heard, \"But it's said there was an artist from Oakdale, a Fodini, who discovered the secret of weaving these fabrics.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:22] Elstir's Studio | I heard the words: \"In a few years, women will be able to stroll about in silk, especially in silk while staying at home, as exquisite and luxurious as the silks designed for the noblewomen of Oakdale with their oriental patterns.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:27] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"I don't know if Steven would like it, whether this kind of clothing is too out of date for today's women, even if it's just to attract spectators for the rowing race.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:32] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"Our modern steamships are completely the opposite of the era of Oakdale, the Queen of the Adriatic.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:37] Elstir's Studio | I heard \"a yacht, the interior of the yacht, the clothing of the people on board, the most moving part was the simplicity and modesty of the items on the sea. Steven loved the sea so much!\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:42] Elstir's Studio | I heard \"Steven frankly admits that he prefers the current style to those of Veronese, even to those of the time of Carpaccio.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:47] Elstir's Studio | I heard him say, \"The beauty of our yacht lies in its uniformity—simple, bright, painted gray. On overcast days, it looks bluish, like soft cream, its lines blurred—especially in medium-sized yachts. Steven doesn't like huge, bulky yachts that smell strongly of boat.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:52] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"The living quarters must be like a small café.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:32:57] Elstir's Studio | I heard that the way women dressed on a pleasure boat was the same: the most beautiful and charming was an outfit that was light, white, and monochromatic—made of canvas, fine linen, Beijing cotton, or herringbone twill—which, under the sunlight, on the blue sea, became as white and dazzling as the sails.\n[1897-09-17 19:33:02] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"Then again, there are few women who know how to dress, but some of them are really remarkable.\"\n[1897-09-17 19:33:07] Elstir's studio | I heard, \"At the racetrack, Miss Léa wore a little white hat and carried a small white parasol, it was adorable! Steven would have paid any price for that little parasol!\"\n[1897-09-18 20:07:50] Elstir's Studio | I wondered what made this little parasol different from all the others, how much Steven longed to know!\n[1897-09-18 20:07:55] Elstir's Studio | I thought Albertine would be even more eager to know, but that was for other reasons, out of a woman's vanity.\n[1897-09-18 20:08:00] Elstir's studio | I thought of how, just like Françoise had said about the flan, \"it's magic,\" the difference was simply a matter of cutting.\n[1897-09-18 20:08:05] Elstir's Studio | I heard George say, \"So small, so round, like a Chinese parasol!\"\n[1897-09-18 20:08:10] Elstir's Studio | I saw Steven mentioning the parasols of certain women. I thought to myself that George would say it was nothing like that at all, and that he found the umbrellas Steven had described absolutely ugly.\n[1897-09-18 20:08:15] Elstir's Studio | I thought he was a man with refined and discerning taste, and three quarters of the parasols held by women seemed to him so ugly they were terrifying.\n[1897-09-18 20:08:20] Elstir's Studio | I could think of the slight difference between these people's umbrellas and the tiny, delicate trinket that had so fascinated him, and he would turn that into something tremendous.\n[1897-09-18 20:08:25] Elstir's studio | I thought that, in Steven's view, all luxury made the mind impoverished. He was the opposite of Steven, passionately advocating his own desire to \"paint something just as beautiful as this.\"\n[1897-09-18 20:08:30] Elstir's Studio | I saw George pointing to Albertine and saying something to Steven. I heard, \"Look, this girl already understands what the hat and parasol are like.\"\n[1897-09-18 20:08:35] Elstir's Studio | I saw Albertine's eyes gleaming with covetousness.\n[1897-09-18 20:08:50] Elstir's Studio | I heard her say to the painter, \"Steven is so eager to get rich, just so he can buy a yacht! He'll certainly ask you about the interior decoration, and Steven will have such a beautiful sea voyage! How lovely it would be to go see the races at Cowes! What about having a car? Do you think the style of women's automobile dresses looks nice?\"\n[1897-09-18 20:08:55] Elstir's Studio | I heard George answer, \"Not beautiful, but it will be beautiful in the future.\"\n[1897-09-18 20:09:00] Elstir's studio | \"I heard him say, 'Besides, there are very few fashion masters—may be one or two: Gauthier, though he uses too much lace; Dusse, Chevrier, sometimes even Bagan. The rest are absolutely terrifying.'\"\n[1897-09-18 20:09:05] Elstir's Studio | I heard Steven ask Albertine, \"So, the difference between wearing clothes from Gallo's and those made by an ordinary tailor is quite significant, isn't it?\"\n[1897-09-18 20:09:10] Elstir's Studio | I heard her answer Steven: \"Of course it's huge, you silly little Steven! Oh, sorry. It's just, alas! Things that cost three hundred francs elsewhere cost two thousand there.\"\n[1897-09-18 20:09:15] Elstir's Studio | I heard, \"But it's really different, to someone completely unfamiliar with the subject, it may seem similar at first glance.\"\n[1897-09-18 20:09:20] Elstir's Studio | I heard George answer, \"Exactly.\" I thought to myself that he hadn't mentioned it, the difference being as great as that between a statue in the cathedral of Reims and one in the cathedral of Saint Augustine.\n[1897-09-18 20:09:25] Elstir's Studio | I heard him say specifically to Steven: \"Yes, speaking of the cathedral, that day Steven told you about the Sainte-Chapelle as if it were a tall cliff, a huge cliff made of local stone.\" I thought that because Steven and his friends once discussed this topic, and those girls weren't part of that conversation, and besides, it would never have interested them anyway.\n[1897-09-18 20:09:30] Elstir's Studio | I saw him pointing to a small colored painting and saying something to Steven. \"I heard him say, 'But on the contrary, look at these cliffs (this is a sketch, taken from Unknown_Creuniers, not far from here). Look at these powerful yet very elegant rock formations—they so resemble a great cathedral!\"",

I thought it was precisely this that made Steven exclaim, how unfortunate it was that Steven had never seen the Unknown_Creuniers!\n[1897-09-19 20:46:33] Elstir's Studio | I saw Albertine and André reassuring each other that Steven had certainly been there a hundred times.\n[1897-09-19 20:46:43] Elstir's Studio | I thought that, in this way, one day when I saw the Unknown_Creuniers, it would unexpectedly and without warning give Steven this longing for beauty, although it would not exactly be the natural beauty that Steven had sought so far among the cliffs of Riverside, but rather, more accurately, an architectural beauty.\n[1897-09-19 20:46:48] Elstir's studio | I know that especially Steven went out to see the kingdom of the storm. During the walks that Steven took with Madame de Charles, the Stevenes often only caught a distant glimpse of the sea through the gaps in the trees. I thought that Steven never felt the sea as real, flowing, living, something capable of raising vast waves.\n[1897-09-19 20:46:53] Elstir's studio | I thought Steven might only like to see the vast ocean, motionless and wrapped in a winter shroud.\n[1897-09-19 20:46:58] Elstir's Studio | I thought how little Steven could believe it, that what Steven had longed for was now nothing more than a formless mist, the sea having lost its solidity and color!\n[1897-09-19 20:47:03] Elstir's studio | I thought, but George, just like those people in a ship made numb by the heat who drift into reverie, had already grasped the charm of such a sea, had become adept at reporting the imperceptible movement of the water, the pulse of a joyful minute, and fixing it on canvas.\n[1897-09-19 20:47:08] Elstir's Studio | I thought of how, when people saw this magical portrait, they would only be thinking of traveling the world to recover those lost days, to retrieve that fleeting, sleeping beauty.\n[1897-09-19 20:47:13] Elstir's studio | Before my visits to George, before I saw his seascape, when Steven faced the sea, he always tried to exclude from his vision the swimmers in the foreground and the sailboats with their too-white sails, like beach suits, anything that might interfere with Steven's ability to convince himself that he was gazing at the eternal flow of water.\n[1897-09-19 20:47:18] Elstir's Studio | I thought that long before humans appeared, the stream had already been pouring forth its mysterious life.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:19] Elstir's studio | I saw a young woman in a long dress of Balenciaga or fine linen standing on a yacht flying the American flag, before this seascape.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:34] Elstir's studio | I thought of how she had injected into Steven's imagination the \"dual\" authority of a white linen dress and a national flag.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:39] Elstir's Studio | I thought of Steven's imagination, which immediately gave rise to an insatiable desire to see the white linen dresses and the national flag right away by the sea.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:44] Elstir's studio | I thought of the fine days, as if they had wrapped this coast, shrouded in mist and storms, with the ordinary summer landscape that is so all-encompassing, marking a simple pause in time, like the rest in music.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:49] Elstir's Studio | I thought that now, in Steven's view, bad weather had become some sort of tragic event, no longer having a place in the world of beauty: Steven eagerly wished to find in reality the things that had so excited him, and he hoped for sunny weather so that he could see, from the cliff's edge, figures in blue just like those in George's paintings.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:54] Elstir's Studio | I thought of how Steven had once imagined that the life of nature existed before the emergence of human beings, and was in conflict with the refined and tedious machinery of various industries.\n[1897-09-21 00:33:59] Elstir's Studio | I thought of these industrial machines, and even today, just the idea of visiting the World's Fair or entering a ladies' hat shop would make me yawn, all because of Steven.\n[1897-09-21 00:34:04] Elstir's Studio | I thought that at that time, Steven looked at the sea, trying to see only the parts without steamships, so as to keep in his mind the image of the sea as it had always been, separated from the land, at least as old as the first centuries when Greece had existed.\n[1897-09-21 00:34:09] Elstir's Studio | I thought that in this way, Steven would be able to repeatedly recite the verses from \"Old James Leconte\" that Richard loved, and regard them as eternal truths: \"They set out, the kings full of spirit and vigor, leading the long-haired warriors of hero Hélen to the tumultuous seas!\"\n[1897-09-21 00:34:14] Elstir's Studio | I know that George once told Steven that the milliners performed beautiful, delicate movements as they made the final touches to finished hats, adjusting ribbons or feathers with great care, and that this fascinated him so much that he wanted to capture it on canvas just as he would a horseman's movement (this delighted Albertine).\n[1897-09-21 00:34:34] Elstir's Studio | I thought that, in that case, Steven could no longer look down on the hat-making women.\n[1897-09-21 00:34:39] Elstir's Studio | I thought, but the hat-making girl would have to wait until Steven returned to Willowbrook to see him.\n[1897-09-21 00:34:44] Elstir's studio | Whenever I thought about horse races and regattas, I had to wait until Steven returned to Riverside to see them, for before next year, there would be no more horse races or regattas in Riverside, and even the yachts carrying women in white linen dresses far away would no longer be seen.\n[1897-09-21 19:00:00] Balbec | I often saw Steven encountering Richard's sisters, ever since Steven had dined at their father's house; after that, he could no longer avoid greeting them.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:05] Balbec | I heard that Steven's girlfriends didn't know them, and Albertine often said, \"Steven isn't allowed to play with Jews at home.\"\n[1897-09-21 23:00:10] Balbec | I thought of how she had pronounced \"Israel\" as \"Yi She Lie,\" and this way of speaking, even if you hadn't heard the beginning of the sentence, would have told you that these devout bourgeois young ladies did not hold the chosen people of God in high regard, and perhaps they would easily believe that Jews sacrificed Christian children.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:15] Balbec | I saw Andréa smile slightly, indicating she clearly knew those women were not Steven's girlfriends. I heard her say to Steven, \"Besides, your girlfriends behave very improperly.\"\n[1897-09-21 23:00:20] Balbec | I heard Albertine reply in the manner of someone experienced, using a proverbial tone: \"Everything related to this tri be is like that.\"\n[1897-09-21 23:00:25] Balbec | I thought to myself that, honestly, Richard's sisters, dressed too heavily yet half-naked, listless, audacious, ostentatious, and sloppy, would not make a good impression on anyone.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:30] Balbec | I knew they had a younger cousin, only fifteen years old, and her infatuation with Mademoiselle Léa caused revulsion throughout the fair.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:35] Balbec | I knew that Mr. Richard greatly admired Miss Léa's artistic talent, but he lacked the ability to judge the artistic talent of male actors.",

    "text": "[1897-09-21 23:00:40] Farmhouse Restaurant | I saw that on some days, the Stevenes went to a farmhouse restaurant nearby for tea.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:45] Country Restaurant | I knew the name of this farm was Égorgues-Marie-Thérèse, the Erelle Cross, Trivialities, California, Marie-Antoinette, and so on; this little group usually chose the Marie-Antoinette farm.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:50] Cliff | I saw that sometimes the Stevenes didn't go to the farmhouse but kept climbing all the way to the cliff's edge. Once there, they would sit on the wild grass and open the sandwiches and pastry packs they had brought.\n[1897-09-21 23:00:55] Cliff | I saw Steven's girlfriends prefer eating sandwiches, so they were surprised to see Steven only eat a piece of chocolate pastries decorated with sugar in Gothic script or a slice of apricot tart.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:00] Cliff | I thought it was because, faced with this new and ignorant food—a sandwich with cheese and lettuce—Steven had nothing to say, while the snack, being educated, and the fruit platter, was endlessly talkative.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:05] Cliff | I thought of the bland cream in the pastries, the fresh flavor of fruit in the fruit tart, things that told much about Sunrise and Michael, making Steven recall the small dishes that had stories from One Thousand and One Nights on them.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:10] Cliff | I knew that each day, Françoise would give my aunt Léonie the stories of \"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp,\" then \"Ali Baba,\" \"The Man Who Slept with His Eyes Open,\" and \"Sinbad Sailing Away with All His Treasures to Basra,\" and these tales' \"subjects\" really delighted my aunt Léonie.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:15] Cliff | I thought how Steven wished he could see those dishes again, but David didn't know what had become of them afterward, and she considered them merely cheap, tasteless dishes bought locally.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:20] Cliff | I realized it all didn't matter anyway. In the gray, misty Sunrise of Champagne, the trademarks on the plates still bore colorful patterns, just like the stained glass windows in the dark church, just like the images projected by the magic lantern in Steven's room during dusk, just like the Indian gold buttons and Persian cloves before the landscape photographs at the station and the provincial railway, just like the set of ancient Chinese porcelain in the dim house of Steven's aunt.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:25] Cliff | I saw Steven lying on the cliff, and all I could see was patches of grass. I saw above the grass, not the seven heavens of Christian theory, but only two: one deeper— the sea—and the higher one, lighter.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:30] Cliff | I saw that if Steven brought along some little trinket that would please one or the other of his girlfriends, they would suddenly light up with joy. I saw their transparent faces turn suddenly red.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:35] Cliff | I saw their mouths unable to contain their joy, and they had to express it, so they burst into laughter.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:40] Cliff | I saw the Stevenes savoring this joy. I thought of them gathering around Steven, their faces not far apart.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:45] Cliff | I saw the air drawing blue paths between the faces, like the paths a gardener might leave open so he can walk back and forth among the rosebushes.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:50] Cliff | I saw that the food brought was all gone, and the Stevenes started playing games.\n[1897-09-21 23:01:55] Cliff | I thought that up until then, Steven had always found these games boring, sometimes even as childish and ridiculous as \"Tower Guard\" or \"Who Laughs First,\" but at that moment, Steven would not have given up these games even if offered an empire.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:00] Cliff | I thought of the faces of these young girls, still glowing with the radiance of youthful blossoming, while Steven's age had already surpassed that stage.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:05] Cliff | I thought of how this brilliance illuminated everything before them, like the vivid scenes of certain early religious painters, where even the most trivial details on a golden background stood out from their lives.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:10] Cliff | I thought that for most of these girls, their faces were merged with the fleeting red haze of dawn, and their true personalities had not yet emerged.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:15] Cliff | I thought that what people saw was only the brilliant colors, and beneath this color, the outlines that would emerge years later were still indistinct.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:20] Cliff | I thought that nothing in today's outline could be considered definitively shaped; it was only temporarily similar to some deceased member of the family, and the Creator had already paid this commemorative tribute to that departed person.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:25] Cliff | I thought of the body as fixed and unchangeable, with no more promises to offer, no more surprises to delight you.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:30] Cliff | I thought of seeing, not yet aged faces with receding or white hair, like withered leaves on a tree in the height of summer, already without hope.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:35] Cliff | I had thought that such moments would come swiftly, this morning of countless golden rays was so fleeting that someone might have only reached the stage of a young girl in the first blushes of love.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:40] Cliff | I thought of these girls' bodies, like a precious lump of dough, still developing, merely a handful of malleable material, the fleeting imprints that shaped them were constantly molding them.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:45] Cliff | I thought that one could say that each of them was a lively, mature, coquettish, and astonished little sculpture made up of straightforward, complete, and fleeting expressions.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:50] Cliff | I thought of the passionate concern a young girl would show toward Steven, and this malleability would endow it with extreme richness and great charm.\n[1897-09-21 23:02:55] Cliff | I thought, of course, this passionate concern was also essential for a woman; women who didn't like Stevenes, or who didn't let Stevenes see that they found them likable, always seemed in Steven's eyes to have some tedious sameness about them.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:00] Cliff | I thought about this concern itself, which, from a certain age onward, no longer brought about soft changes on faces that had become harsh and rigid due to the struggle for survival, faces that always seemed either warrior-like or strangely transcendent.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:05] Cliff | I thought of some faces that, through the repeated influence of a husband's authority, no longer seemed like women's faces, but rather those of soldiers.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:10] Cliff | I thought of another face, shaped by Robert's daily willing sacrifices for her children, and it had become the face of an apostle.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:15] Cliff | I thought of another face, which after years of adversity and storms had become the face of an old sea wolf, only the clothes she wore revealing her gender.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:20] Cliff | I thought, of course, that when the Stevenes loved this woman, for the Stevenes, a woman's concern could still bestow new charm on the time they spent with her. But to the Stevenes, she would not be a different woman before and after.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:25] Cliff | I thought that her happiness was something foreign to an unchanging face.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:30] Cliff | I thought of my youth, which had not yet solidified completely, and so there was a sense of freshness about a girl's presence.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:35] Cliff | I thought of watching constantly changing shapes, of constantly forming unstable contrasts, which gives a sense of freshness, reminding one of the continuous renewal of the major elements in nature. What people face when gazing at the sea and reflecting is precisely this unceasing process of renewal.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:40] Cliff | I thought of how Steven had sacrificed not just a daytime social gathering, or a walk in Charles, but something far more significant for these girlfriends' \"circle guessing game\" or \"riddle game.\"\n[1897-09-21 23:03:45] Cliff | I saw that on several occasions, Peter had someone tell Steven that since Steven wouldn't come to East Tilloy to see him, he could take a twenty-four-hour leave to come see Steven in Riverside.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:50] Cliff | I saw that Steven always wrote to him, begging him not to do it. Steven's excuse was that he wasn't there that day, that he was going to visit relatives somewhere nearby with David.\n[1897-09-21 23:03:55] Cliff | When I thought about how he had learned from his great-aunt that this was some relative of Steven, and when I wondered who exactly was playing the role of Steven's grandmother, I must have formed a poor opinion of Steven.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:00] Cliff | I thought that perhaps it was not wrong for Steven to sacrifice the pleasures of socializing and the joy of friendship in order to choose the pleasure of spending his days wandering in the garden.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:05] Cliff | I thought of those people who had this possibility--they were indeed artists, and Steven had long been convinced he would never become one--and they also had the obligation to live for themselves.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:10] Cliff | I thought that friendship for them was an expenditure of this obligation, a renunciation of Steven.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:15] Cliff | I thought that even the conversation, which was supposed to be a form of friendship, was nothing but shallow nonsense, leaving Stevenes with nothing.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:20] Cliff | I thought that Steven and others could chat all their lives, saying nothing at all, just endlessly repeating the emptiness of a single minute. In the solitary work of artistic creation, thoughts move forward into depth, and this direction is not closed off to Steven and others; they could continue in this direction.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:25] Cliff | I found it increasingly difficult, that's true, but it could lead to real results, whereas friendship is not only as unproductive as conversation, but also harmful.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:30] Cliff | I thought of the Stevenes who, as individuals with purely internal growth patterns, would feel restless if they remained on the surface of themselves beside their friends, instead of continuing their voyages of discovery into the depths.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:35] Cliff | I thought of this oppressive impression, and when Steven's friends were once again alone together, their friendly affection would urge Steven to correct it, urging Steven to passionately recall what Steven's friends had said to Steven, treating those words as precious gains.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:40] Cliff | I thought of Steven and others, who were unlike buildings that could have stones added from the outside, but rather like trees that nourish the next section of their branches and the topmost flowers with their own sap.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:45] Cliff | I thought about how Steven was glad he had been favored and appreciated by someone as kind, intelligent, and likable as Peter. Steven didn't try to adjust his own intelligence to suit his confused impressions—sorting out these confused impressions was his duty—instead, he adjusted himself to his friend's words.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:50] Cliff | I thought of Steven, who once again repeated these words—repeating them to the person who lived within Steven, yet was not the same as Steven himself, the person who always liked to pass on the burden of thinking to someone else. I tried desperately to find the beauty in this friend.\n[1897-09-21 23:04:55] Cliff | I thought this beauty was entirely different from the beauty Steven sought when he was truly alone, but this beauty gave Peter, Steven himself, and Steven's life a greater value.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:00] Cliff | I realized that when I thought about Steven doing this, I was only deceiving myself, interrupting the process of growing up.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:05] Cliff | I thought that if things continued along their original course, Steven would indeed truly grow up and find happiness.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:10] Cliff | I thought about how, in the life that such a friend had created for Steven, Steven seemed to delicately avoid loneliness and nobly wish to sacrifice himself for him, yet was actually unaware of his own mission.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:15] Cliff | I thought the opposite: near these girls, although Steven's pleasure was selfish, at least it was not based on lies.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:20] Cliff | I thought about how lies tried to make the Stevenes believe that they were not hopelessly lonely, and how lies prevented the Stevenes from admitting that when they spoke, it was not really themselves who were speaking; at those moments, the Stevenes shaped themselves according to others' models, rather than shaping a self different from others.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:25] Cliff | I thought the few words exchanged between this group of girls and Steven were rather uninteresting, and Steven himself spoke very little, his part of the conversation frequently interrupted by long silences.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:30] Cliff | I thought that it didn't prevent them from speaking to Steven, for Steven listened to them with the same happy feeling, just as he would look at them with immense joy, discovering a vivid and colorful picture in the voice of each one.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:35] Cliff | I saw Steven listening to them with great pleasure as they chattered away. I thought that passion helps people distinguish, to tell apart, in a forest, a bird lover can immediately recognize the unique songs of each bird, while an ordinary person cannot tell them apart.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:40] Cliff | I thought about how those who love young girls know that the human voice is even more varied than that, each voice containing notes that surpass the expressiveness of the most versatile instrument, and the way each voice combines these notes is as endlessly varied as a person's personality.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:45] Cliff | I saw him talking with one of his girlfriends. I thought of Steven, who had discovered the original painting that uniquely expressed her personality, skillfully drawn before Steven's eyes through the inflections of her voice and the changes in her facial expressions, forcefully imposed upon Steven.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:50] Cliff | I thought that Steven had realized these were two plays, each operating within its own realm, both depicting the same strange reality.\n[1897-09-21 23:05:55] Cliff | I thought that certainly, just like the lines of the face, the curve of the voice was not yet finally fixed; the voice would change, and the face would change too.\n[1897-09-21 23:06:00] Cliff | I thought of how, just as babies have a salivary gland that secretes liquid to help them digest milk, and which disappears when they grow up, there are also notes in the chatter of these girls that vanish forever once they become adult women.\n[1897-09-22 07:56:55] Cliff | I saw Steven, and I felt these girls playing this more colorful instrument with the same serious and passionate devotion as the little angelic musicians in Bellini's music, a seriousness and passion that were also the distinctive qualities of youth.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:00] Cliff | I saw how this passionate and confident tone gave a touching charm to the simplest things, whether it was Albertine delivering a witty remark with authority or Andre talking about their schoolwork.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:05] Cliff | I saw the youngest girl listening to Albertine with great admiration, until finally she could no longer hold back and burst out laughing like a sneeze.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:10] Cliff | I thought of André talking about their school assignments, which were more childish than the games they played, a thoroughly childish seriousness.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:15] Cliff | I thought that in ancient times, when poetry and music were not yet distinct, poems were recited with different tones, and their words rang out clearly, like the verses of antiquity.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:20] Cliff | I thought that, despite everything, these girls' voices clearly showed each of these little people had their own views on life.",

    "text": "[1897-09-22 07:57:25] Cliff | I thought these opinions were so personal. If the Stevenes said, \"She takes everything as a joke,\" or \"She moves from certainty to certainty,\" or if the third person said, \"She always stays in a state of expectant hesitation,\" they were all using too general terms.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:30] Cliff | I thought that later, these girls would lose this voice, and the lines on Steven's face were almost just movements that no longer changed, formed merely by habit.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:35] Cliff | I thought of the Creator, like the disaster of Pompeii, or the transformation of the nymphs, fixing Stevenes in their habitual gestures. Similarly, the rise and fall of the Stevenes' tones contained their life philosophy, the way people constantly think about things.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:40] Cliff | I thought, of course, these lines did not belong only to these girls; they belonged to their parents as well, their personalities soaked in something more universal than the individuals themselves.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:45] Cliff | I thought that what my parents provided was not only the habitual things like facial features and voice characteristics, but also certain ways of speaking, certain habitual expressions.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:50] Cliff | I thought of these things as something almost as unconscious as tone, as deep as tone, and like tone, marking a point of view on life.\n[1897-09-22 07:57:55] Cliff | I know that for these girls, before they reach a certain age, some words have not yet been given to them by their parents, and this is true. I thought that generally, they would not be fully entrusted to them until they became adult women, and those words were still stored away now.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:00] Cliff | I thought, for example, that if we were talking about a painting by George, the Andree with her long hair still hanging down, she still couldn't use the kind of vocabulary my Robert and her married sister used: \"That man seems very attractive.\"\n[1897-09-22 07:58:05] Cliff | I thought about it, but when the time came to go to the palace, such a moment arrived.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:10] Cliff | I had noticed that Albertine, since her first communion, had often been saying, \"Steven would find it quite terrifying,\" just like a girlfriend of her aunt.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:15] Cliff | I saw that people also gave her a habit, which was to repeat what others said to her. I thought of appearing very interested and making every effort to form a distinctive opinion.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:20] Cliff | I heard that if someone said a certain painter's work was good, or that his house was beautiful, she would say, \"Ah? His paintings are good? Ah? His house is beautiful?\"\n[1897-09-22 07:58:25] Cliff | I thought that, in general, the flavorful ingredients imposed by the provinces where they were born were more common than family heritage; their voices came from the provinces where they had been born, and their tones clung tightly to that provincial accent.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:30] Cliff | When I saw Andrée plucking a bass note, it only caused the short, thick strings of her instrument to emit a vocalized sound, perfectly harmonious with her Southern features.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:35] Cliff | I saw Unknown_Rosemonde, and her northern features and voice, with their raw quality, were in perfect harmony with her endless teasing. No matter what she said, always carrying the accent of her province, it was always like that.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:40] Cliff | I thought of Steven, who realized that this province was engaged in a beautiful dialogue with the girl's delicate, fluctuating temperament—not a discordant one, but a harmonious one; no discord could ever separate the girl from her homeland, for she remained its very essence.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:45] Cliff | I thought that, in addition, the local ingredients had a counter-effect on the genius who used them, giving the genius even more vitality.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:50] Cliff | I thought that this backlash would not diminish the personal character of the architect's work, or the delicate craftsmanship of the cabinetmaker, or the work of the musician; the most subtle characteristics reflecting the artist's personality would remain just as detailed.\n[1897-09-22 07:58:55] Cliff | I thought of how the artist, compelled to work on the rough sandstone of Sarrance or the purple clay of Strasbourg, followed the peculiar knots of the ash tree, and in his writing considered the sources and limitations of sound, the possibilities of the flute or the viola (or mezzo-soprano).\n[1897-09-22 07:59:00] Cliff | I thought of Steven realizing all this, yet Steven's conversations were so few!\n[1897-09-22 07:59:05] Cliff | I thought of Steven when he was with Charles or Peter. At those times, Steven would express happiness through words, a much more intense happiness than he actually felt. When he left them, he was always physically and mentally exhausted.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:10] Cliff | I thought the opposite: lying among these girls, Steven's rich feelings infinitely surpassed the meager and sparse words of the Stevens, drowning Steven's motionless body and silence, overflowing into a river of happiness.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:15] Cliff | I thought of the flowing water coming forth and vanishing at the feet of these newly opened roses.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:20] Cliff | I thought of a person who had just recovered from a serious illness, spending his days resting in a garden or orchard. A scent of flowers or fruit was nothing compared to the color and fragrance that Steven sought in these girls, which deeply affected him. In the end, their sweetness merged completely with Steven.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:25] Cliff | I thought that grapes must gather their internal sugars under the sunlight, just like that.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:30] Cliff | I saw these simple games continuing slowly on. I thought of the inner lightness, the happy smile, the faint dizziness that came over Steven, who kept closing his eyes, just like those idle people who spend their days on the seashore, breathing in the salty air and tanning their skin.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:35] Cliff | I thought that sometimes, the warm concern of a young girl might cause a strong tremor in Steven's heart, diverting his interest from others for a while.\n[1897-09-22 07:59:40] Cliff | I saw one day just like this: André gave her a pencil, and Unknown_Rosemonde gave her paper. I heard Albertine say, \"Who has a pencil?\"\n[1897-09-22 07:59:45] Cliff | I heard Albertine say to them, \"Ladies, the writing is in progress, no viewing allowed.\"\n[1897-09-22 07:59:50] Cliff | I saw her stick the paper to her knee and carefully draw each letter in a neat, deliberate way, then hand the paper to Steven. I heard her say to Steven, \"Be careful, don't let anyone see!\"\n[1897-09-22 07:59:55] Cliff | I saw Steven open the note. I saw that she had written to Steven these few words: \"Steven likes you.\"\n[1897-09-22 08:00:00] Cliff | I saw her turn to André and Unknown_Rosemonde, and she called out to them in a loud, passionate, and solemn voice. I heard, \"Let's stop writing foolish things. This morning Steven received a letter from Hissel, and Steven needs to show it to you.\"\n[1897-09-22 08:00:05] Cliff | I heard, \"Steven is really crazy. The letter was right in Steven's pocket, and it would have been very useful to Steven!\"\n[1897-09-23 04:36:41] Cliff | I knew that Céline thought she should send the essay she had written to obtain her high school diploma to her girlfriend, so she could read it to her other girlfriends.\n[1897-09-23 04:37:01] Cliff | I knew there were two topics for Hérisson to choose from, both of which were more difficult than Albertine had feared: one was a letter from Sophocles to Racine from the underworld, comforting him over the failure of his play \"Adrienne\"; the other was a letter from Madame de Sévigné to Madame de La Fayette after the premiere of \"Isabelle,\" expressing deep regret at her absence. Please draft the letters.",

    "text": "[1897-09-24 04:53:21] Cliff | I knew the first topic was the hardest, and Héloïse worked at it with great effort; she probably moved the examiners, and she chose the first subject, presenting it very well, and ended up getting fourteen points. The jury also congratulated her.\n[1897-09-24 04:53:41] Cliff | I know that if she hadn't messed up her Spanish exam, she might have gotten the \"Honorable Mention\"!\n[1897-09-24 04:54:01] Cliff | I saw Albertine immediately read to Steven the exam paper that Hirschel had sent her. I thought about the fact that Albertine was also taking the same exam, and she very much wanted to hear Andre's opinion.\n[1897-09-24 04:54:06] Cliff | I thought that André was better than all of them in this regard and could give her some good advice.\n[1897-09-24 04:54:11] Cliff | \"I heard Albertine say, 'She's really lucky,' because that was exactly the topic her French teacher had made her write on!\"\n[1897-09-24 04:54:16] Cliff | I know that the letter that Hessel wrote to Racine begins like this: \"Dear friend, I have long been deprived of the pleasure of your acquaintance, and I write to you boldly, begging your pardon.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:54:36] Cliff | I know that your new work, \"Adaline,\" must indicate that you have thoroughly studied my work. Not only do you have the protagonist or main character speak verses in the tragedy, but you have also written excellent verses for the chorus.\n[1897-09-24 04:54:56] Cliff | I know it's improper to let Steven speak so frankly to you, but I'm told that in Greek tragedy the chorus could manage, but in France, this is a genuine innovation.\n[1897-09-24 04:55:16] Cliff | I know that your genius, so meticulously refined, so keen, so charming, so delicate, so noble, has reached the pinnacle of perfection; I offer you my congratulations.\n[1897-09-24 04:55:36] Cliff | I know characters like Adèle and Joconde; your opponent Corneille could not surpass them, for they are bold in character, simple yet powerful in plot.\n[1897-09-24 04:55:56] Cliff | I know this tragedy is not driven by love; Steven offers you his sincere admiration, and the most famous maxims are not always the most correct.\n[1897-09-24 04:56:16] Cliff | I know that the example Steven cited to you is precisely that; for this passionate depiction, it is the most reliable path to move the heart.\n[1897-09-24 04:56:36] Cliff | I know that the religious fervor your choir radiates is not without the power to move people; the general audience may be overwhelmed, but the true connoisseurs will give you a fair assessment. My heartfelt congratulations and highest respect.\n[1897-09-24 04:56:56] Cliff | I saw Albertine reading aloud. I saw her eyes flickering, glowing with a steady light.\n[1897-09-24 04:57:06] Cliff | After reading it, she screamed. \"I heard 'It's really hard to believe she got that from somewhere, Steven doesn't believe for a second that Héloïse could have laid such an egg! And the quotes she used! Where did she steal them from?\"\n[1897-09-24 04:57:11] Cliff | I thought that, next, Albertine's object of admiration changed, which was true, but her admiration only increased.\n[1897-09-24 04:57:16] Cliff | Throughout the entire time Andre spoke, I saw her eyes wide open, filled with admiration to the point where they seemed to pop out of her head.\n[1897-09-24 04:57:31] Location: Cliff | I knew that André was the oldest and most capable, and others wanted to hear her opinion.\n[1897-09-24 04:57:51] Cliff | I saw her first speak of Hessel's homework in a sarcastic tone. I thought of it again, and with an expression of mock seriousness that could not conceal my genuine solemnity, I rewrote the letter in my own way.\n[1897-09-24 04:57:56] Cliff | I heard her say to Albertine, \"It's not bad, but if Steven were in your place, they'd give Steven the same question—this is possible, because this question is often given—and Steven wouldn't do it like that.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:01] Cliff | I heard someone say, \"What should Steven do? First, if Steven were Hessel, Steven wouldn't act so impulsively right away. Steven would first jot down Steven's outline on another sheet of paper.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:06] Cliff | I heard him say, \"First, raise the question and introduce the topic; then, give a general idea of the development section; finally, offer an evaluation, style, and conclusion. In this way, just by looking at the outline, one can tell how the thinking process goes.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:11] Cliff | I heard \"Tytine, as soon as the theme is introduced, or if you prefer, since this is a letter, one might say 'as soon as the subject is touched upon,' Hirschel did something foolish, Sophocles writing a letter to a seventeenth-century person, and he shouldn't have written 'Dear Friend.'\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:16] Cliff | I saw Albertine shouting with passion. I heard, \"Indeed, she should have said 'Dear Racine' as Sophocles did, that would have been much better.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:21] Cliff | I heard André laugh in a sarcastic tone as he replied, \"No, she should have written 'Sir,' and at the end, she should have used something like 'Sir (or at most, 'Dear Sir'), forgive Steven for his respectful submission, your humble servant.'\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:26] Cliff | I heard him say, \"On the other hand, Héloïse said that the chorus in Adaline was an innovation; she had forgotten Estelle and two less well-known tragedies, which the teacher had just analyzed this year.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:31] Cliff | \"I heard him say, 'So, as long as these two tragedies are mentioned, which are the teacher's favorite topics, you can be sure to pass. These plays are Peter-Garnier's The Jewish Woman and Moncrasien's Pardon.'\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:36] Cliff | I saw Andre reveal the two play titles. I saw her sincere affection, which was evident in the way she stood a little taller than others, expressed through a gentle smile, a beautiful and touching smile.\n[1897-09-24 04:58:46] Cliff | I saw that Albertine could no longer contain herself; she screamed. I heard him say, \"André, you're brilliant. You must write down these two play titles for Steven. Do you believe it? If Steven were to come across this question, how lucky he'd be! Even if he had an oral exam, Steven would immediately talk about these two plays, and that would surely make a deep impression.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:58:51] Cliff | After that, whenever Albertine asked André to repeat the titles of the two plays again so she could write them down, I would see it. I knew that this learned friend had claimed to have forgotten, and had never mentioned it to her again.\n[1897-09-24 04:59:01] Cliff | I saw Andrei go on speaking. I thought of the subtle disdain I felt for more childish companions, yet I was still elated that others admired me, and my own concern about how to write this essay exceeded what she hoped others would care about.\n[1897-09-24 04:59:06] Cliff | \"I heard him say, 'Furthermore, Sophocles in the underworld should be well-informed. He should know that Adaline was performed before the Sun King and a few privileged courtiers, not for the general audience.'\"\n[1897-09-24 04:59:11] Cliff | I heard that \"Hessel's praise of him as an expert in this regard is quite accurate, but perhaps something more could be added. Sophocles has become immortal and certainly possesses the genius of prophecy, declaring, as Voltaire said, that Adela is not only Racine's masterpiece but also a masterpiece of human intellect.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:59:16] Cliff | I saw Albertine greedily sipping these words. I saw her eyes burning with fire.\n[1897-09-24 04:59:26] Cliff | At that moment, Unknown_Rosemonde proposed starting the game, and she refused it with great indignation.\n[1897-09-24 04:59:36] Cliff | I heard André speak in the same indifferent, casual, slightly mocking yet very confident and passionate tone: \"Finally, if Hélène had first calmly written down the general ideas she intended to develop, she might have thought about what Steven would do, which is to point out the difference between the religious inspiration of the chorus in Sophocles and that of the chorus in Racine.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:59:41] Cliff | I heard \"Steven wanted to point out that although Racine's choruses were filled with religious emotion like those of Greek tragedies, the gods they worshipped were not the same; the gods of Joaquin and those of Sophocles had nothing in common.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:59:46] Cliff | I heard him say, \"At the end of the development, it naturally leads to the conclusion: 'What difference does religion make?' Sophocles might have had some reservations about emphasizing this point.\"\n[1897-09-24 04:59:51] Cliff | I heard him say that he might have been worried that this would offend Racine's religious beliefs, so on this matter he added a few words about Racine's teachers in Port-Royal, choosing instead to compliment the poetic talent of his opponent.\n[1897-09-24 04:59:56] Cliff | I saw admiration and rapt attention make Albertine's body feverish, and now she was drenched in sweat.\n[1897-09-24 05:00:11] Cliff | I saw Andre' maintaining that slightly smiling detachment characteristic of a fashionable young woman.\n[1897-09-24 05:00:26] Cliff | I saw and then the Stevenes started playing again. I heard her say, \"It wouldn't hurt to quote a few more famous critics.\"\n[1897-09-24 05:00:31] Cliff | I heard Albertine reply, \"Yes, someone told Steven this before, generally speaking, the most praiseworthy argument is that of Sainte-Beuve and Maupassant, isn't it?\"\n[1897-09-24 05:00:36] Cliff | I saw Andre read the letter, and no matter how Albertine pleaded, she never gave her the names of the two plays. I heard him say, \"You're not necessarily wrong, Maile and Sainte-Beuve won't ruin anything, but it's especially important to quote Daudet and Gauthier de Costes.\"\n[1897-09-24 05:00:41] Cliff | I was thinking about this when Steven kept recalling the small piece of paper that Albertine had torn from her notebook and given to Steven: \"Steven really likes you.\"\n[1897-09-24 05:00:46] Path | An hour later, I was walking back down the path to Riverside—too steep for Steven—hillside. I thought to myself that Steven must be romantic with her.\n[1897-09-24 05:00:51] Balbec Hotel | I thought of a series of signs, through which, in general, Stevens could tell that Steven had fallen in love.\n[1897-09-24 14:56:50] Balbec Hotel | I saw, for example, that Steven had ordered the hotel not to wake him up for any visitor, except for whichever of these girls came to see him.\n[1897-09-24 14:56:55] Balbec Hotel | I felt my heart pounding so violently as I waited for them (whichever one of them was coming).\n[1897-09-24 14:57:00] Balbec Hotel | I thought of the frustration Steven would feel if he failed to find a barber to shave him, and had to appear awkwardly before Albertine, Rosamund, or André.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:05] Balbec Hotel | I thought of this state, characterized by these signals, in which one girl or another repeatedly appeared in turn, unlike what the Steven called love, perhaps similar to the difference between the life of a sessile animal and that of a human being.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:10] Balbec Hotel | I thought that, if one may put it that way, in the class of sessile animals, life and personality are distributed among different organs.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:15] Balbec Hotel | I thought, but the natural history told the Stevenes that such animal bodies were observable, and Steven's own life, in any case, had already evolved more than that of a plant, so regarding the truth of the state they had previously not imagined but now should experience, it was not any less certain, unless the Stevenes later abandoned that state.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:20] Balbec Hotel | I thought, for example, of Steven's state of love, in which his heart was divided among several girls at once, loving many, or more accurately, loving one while loving many.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:25] Balbec Hotel | I thought that what most often made Steven feel an intense sweetness, what was unique to him and had become so precious to him that it had become the greatest joy of his life, something he hoped would remain the same the next day, was indeed this entire group of girls, the whole of them drawn from the hours spent on the cliff, on the grassy slope, with the sea wind blowing.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:30] Balbec Hotel | I saw the faces of Albertine, Unknown_Rosemonde, and Andre's appearing in a variety of expressions on that patch of grass. I thought of how it would stimulate Steven's imagination.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:35] Balbec Hotel | I thought of Steven, unable to express which of these places had become so precious to him, or which one he loved most.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:40] Balbec Hotel | I thought that at the beginning of a love affair, as at the end, Stevenes are not simply devoted to the object of their love; rather, it is the desire caused by this object of love (and later, the memory of this object) that wanders through the interchangeable realm of charm—this charm can sometimes be purely physical, or related to food, or one's dwelling—and the various forms of charm are so harmonious that the desire for love never feels out of place beside any particular form of charm.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:45] Balbec Hotel | I thought that, in addition, before them, Steven had not yet grown weary from familiarity; Steven had the ability to see them, which meant that he could feel deep wonder each time he found himself among them.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:50] Balbec Hotel | I realized that part of this astonishment came from the fact that this man was now revealing a new side of himself to Steven and the others, and each person's multiplicity was so vast, with such rich lines on their face and body, that they rarely showed the same lines.\n[1897-09-24 14:57:55] Balbec Hotel | I thought of the Stevenes who had just left this person's side, and in the absolute simplification of their memories, it was as if memory had chosen one particular feature that had impressed them, isolated it, and exaggerated it. So, a woman whom the Stevenes had found tall became in the sketch unusually tall; the Stevenes seemed to think of a woman with blonde hair and rosy white skin, and in the sketch she became pure \"Harmony of Pink and Gold.\"\n[1897-09-24 14:58:00] Balbec Hotel | I thought about the moment this woman would reappear beside Steven, and how all the other forgotten qualities that had once balanced her would then surge upon him in their chaotic complexity. At that moment, her height seemed to shrink, her pink cheeks were submerged, and what Steven had specifically come to seek was replaced by other characteristics.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:05] Balbec Hotel | I thought of these other characteristics, and looking back, the Stevenes had noticed them before, though for some reason they hadn't expected to see them again. Let the Stevenes recall—they wanted to greet a peacock, but found a peony instead.",

    "text": "[1897-09-24 14:58:10] Hotel Balbec | I thought that this kind of inevitable surprise was not unique; there was another sort of surprise, one arising from differences. It was not the difference between the inherited forms of memory and reality, but rather the difference between the person whom the Stevenes had seen last time and this person, who now appeared before them from a different angle, revealing a new aspect to the Stevenes.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:15] Balbec Hotel | I thought that a human face was indeed like the faces of the gods in the polytheistic pantheon of the East, a series of overlapping faces seen from different angles, which mortals cannot fully see all at once.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:20] Balbec Hotel | I thought that the reason Steven and others were surprised was mostly because someone presented the same face to Steven and others.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:25] Balbec Hotel | I thought how Steven and his kind must have gone to great lengths to recreate all the things outside of Steven that had once offered Steven everything— even just the taste of a fruit—so that, as soon as Steven received an impression, he would unknowingly slide down the slope of memory, and before long, Steven would find himself far removed from his own feelings.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:30] Hotel Balbec | I thought that, and each time we met again was a correction, bringing the Stevenes back to what they had truly seen, which they had already forgotten, for what is called remembering someone is actually forgetting them.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:35] Balbec Hotel | I thought that as long as there was a chance for the Stevenes to meet again, the lines that had been forgotten would appear before them again, and at the moment they saw them, the Stevenes would recognize them, and they would have to correct the distorted lines in their memory.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:40] Hotel Balbec | I thought that, in this way, the endless and varied surprises made Steven's daily meetings with these seaside girls so beneficial to his health and so pleasant.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:45] Balbec Hotel | I thought that this surprise was made up not only of many discoveries but also of various vague memories, and added to this was the turmoil they stirred up in Steven's heart—a turmoil that was never entirely what Steven himself thought it was—which made the expectation of the next meeting no longer exactly the same as the expectation of the last one.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:50] Balbec Hotel | I realized that from the moving memory of our last conversation, each walk had delivered a heavy blow to Steven's thoughts, and in no way in the direction he would have planned when alone in his room, calm and reflective.\n[1897-09-24 14:58:55] Balbec Hotel | I thought that when Steven, whose mind was buzzing with words that had stirred him deeply and continued to echo within him long after, returned to the hotel, he had already completely forgotten about the predetermined direction.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:00] Balbec Hotel | I thought that when everyone, the Stevenes, no longer saw him, he was destroyed, and when he reappeared later, it was a new creation, different from the one just before, even more different than any of his previous appearances.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:05] Balbec Hotel | I thought about the changes that dominate all these creations, at least two of them: when Steven recalls the bright eyes and bold expressions, next time it will inevitably be a listless figure, a thoughtful air, precisely the aspect that Steven had overlooked in the previous recollection.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:10] Balbec Hotel | I thought that when we met again, the Stevens would certainly be surprised, meaning that they would almost only remember these impressions.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:15] Balbec Hotel | It was this, which left a mark of disappointment or surprise on Steven's memories when they were contrasted with the new reality, and it was this which seemed to alter reality, reminding Steven that his memory was inaccurate.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:20] Balbec Hotel | I thought about the features of the face that had been overlooked the previous time, and precisely because of that, they now became the most captivating, the most real, and the most corrective aspect, once again becoming material for thought and memory.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:25] Balbec Hotel | I thought of the listless, round figures with their pleasant, thoughtful expressions that Steven and others longed to see again. But next time, the penetrating eyes, the sharp nose, and the tightly closed lips would once again reassert their own inner strength, correcting the discrepancy between Steven's desires and the object he believed to be in line with them.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:30] Balbec Hotel | I thought, of course, that this kind of fidelity to first impressions, and purely superficial ones, which were constantly being revised each time Steven was with his girlfriends, were not only related to their facial features. As the readers have already seen, Steven was also equally sensitive to their voices.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:35] Balbec Hotel | I thought that perhaps their voices were even more disturbing (because a voice is not only a special and sensual surface, like a face, but also a part of an unfathomable abyss, causing that dizzying feeling of hopeless kisses).\n[1897-09-24 14:59:40] Hotel Balbec | I thought of their voices as the single notes of a small instrument, each one giving its all, yet belonging solely to itself.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:45] Balbec Hotel | I thought of that voice, and Steven had already forgotten it; when a certain intonation brought it back, Steven recognized the voice again, and its particular deep curve once more astonished Steven.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:50] Balbec Hotel | I thought to myself that, each time we met, Steven had to make corrections in order to get back to the exact truth, just like a tuner, a music teacher, or a draftsman would make corrections.\n[1897-09-24 14:59:55] Balbec Hotel | I thought of these girls spreading different emotional waves in Steven's heart, each wave resisting the spread of the others, and various waves canceling each other out, for some time already.\n[1897-09-24 15:00:00] Cliff | I saw, one afternoon, when Steven and his friends were playing the game of ring-around-the-rosy, that the harmonious cohesion finally broke, and shifted to Albertine's side.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:11] Cliff | I saw it was in a small grove at the top of the cliff. That day, the Stevenes probably numbered many, and this little group had brought in some outsiders as well.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:26] Cliff | I saw Steven sitting between the two girls who didn't belong to this little group, and Steven was looking at a young man beside Albertine with intense envy.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:31] Cliff | I thought to myself: If Steven were in that position, during those unexpected few minutes that might never come again, he could have touched his girlfriend's hand.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:36] Cliff | I thought that as long as I touched Albertine's hand, even without thinking about what would inevitably result, Steven already found it deliciously sweet.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:41] Cliff | I thought it was not because Steven had never seen hands more beautiful than hers.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:46] Cliff | I saw that even within her group of girlfriends, Andre's hand was much more slender and delicate. I thought of how I seemed to be leading a special, obedient life under the girl's command, yet still independent.\n[1897-09-26 00:25:51] Cliff | I saw that hand often stretched out in front of her, long and elegant, like a noble hound, languid and dreamlike.\n[1897-09-26 00:26:06] Cliff | I knew that suddenly pulling on a phalange would make the hand longer, so George had made several studies of this hand.\n[1897-09-26 00:26:26] Cliff | I saw from a sketch that Andre was warming his hands by the fire, and under the light, his hands looked like two autumn leaves, translucent and golden.\n[1897-09-26 00:26:41] Cliff | I saw that Albertine's hand was somewhat fatter, and when I shook it, her hand first loosened under your grip, then pressed against the force of it. I thought of giving someone an extremely particular feeling.\n[1897-09-26 00:26:46] Cliff | When Albertine's hand was exerting effort, it had a sensual softness that seemed to blend perfectly with the pinkish hue of her skin, slightly tinged with purple.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:01] Cliff | I thought that such an effort seemed to place you inside the girl's body, inside her sensory depths, similar to her loud laughter or the cooing of doves or certain cries, which was rather undignified.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:06] Cliff | I thought of certain women whose handshakes were so delightful, and one truly had to thank civilization for having transformed the handshake into an acceptable form of contact between young men and women meeting for the first time. Albertine was among these women.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:11] Cliff | I thought that if there were some inhuman etiquette that replaced the handshake with another gesture, Steven would probably have to spend every day longing for her unattainable hand with eager anticipation.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:16] Cliff | I thought of the eagerness to touch her hand, which was just as intense as the eagerness to know the taste of her cheek.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:21] Cliff | I thought that if Steven were sitting next to her during a game of musical chairs, the happiness Steven would feel from holding her hand for a long time was not this happiness itself:\n[1897-09-26 00:27:26] Cliff | I thought that, until now, the many love confessions and declarations that had been stifled in my heart by shyness could finally be conveyed through certain movements of the hand.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:31] Cliff | I thought about how, by responding with a different emphasis, she could so easily let Steven know that she accepted those feelings! What a fine conspiracy, what a beautiful beginning to sensual pleasure!\n[1897-09-26 00:27:36] Cliff | I thought that in just a few minutes spent beside her, Steven's love would advance more than it had since the moment he'd met her!\n[1897-09-26 00:27:41] Cliff | I thought that Steven must realize such moments wouldn't last long, and would soon end, because surely this little game couldn't go on for very long; once it ended, it would be too late! Steven was practically jumping out of his seat!\n[1897-09-26 00:27:46] Cliff | I saw Steven deliberately have the ring taken away.\n[1897-09-26 00:27:56] Cliff | As soon as I got to the center of the circle, the ring was passed along. Steven pretended not to notice, but he kept his eyes on it, waiting for the moment when it would reach the boy's hand at Albertine's side.\n[1897-09-26 00:28:06] Cliff | I saw Albertine laughing out loud. I saw the game was lively and cheerful, and her face was flushed pink.\n[1897-09-26 00:28:16] Cliff | I saw Andre seeing the trees around Steven and saying something to Steven, his eyes smiling. I heard \"Steven was just in the woods.\"\n[1897-09-26 00:28:21] Cliff | I thought that Steven believed the laugh was meant only for Steven, as if it transcended the players themselves, as though only Steven and another had enough intelligence to peer into each other's hearts and offer poetic commentary on the game.\n[1897-09-26 00:28:26] Cliff | I saw her sing, though she wasn't particularly emotional: \"Ladies, the ermine has passed by. The beautiful ermine has passed by.\" I thought of her, who was so meticulous that she would not even go to Trianon without holding a Louis XVI-style celebration there, or who would feel that a song had real flavor only when sung in the very environment for which it had been composed.\n[1897-09-26 00:28:31] Cliff | I thought that if Steven had the time to think about it, he would certainly be distressed by the lack of beauty in this artistic treatment, but at that time, Steven's mind was entirely elsewhere.\n[1897-09-26 00:28:36] Cliff | I found myself wondering why Steven had felt so strange about the men and women who took part in the game, and why he had found it so foolish that they couldn't catch the ring.",

    "text": "[1897-09-27 01:01:59] Cliff | I saw Steven looking at Albertine. I saw her so beautiful, so indifferent, so happy.\n[1897-09-27 01:02:09] Cliff | I thought she could never imagine that, when Steven finally managed to get the ring from someone else, she would be right next to Steven, and that he would have to resort to a trick that she would never suspect, otherwise she would get angry.\n[1897-09-27 01:02:14] Cliff | I saw that during the lively game, Albertine's long hair had become loose, forming separate curls that fell on either side of her cheeks. The hair was dry and golden, making her pink skin even more noticeable.\n[1897-09-27 01:02:29] Cliff | I saw that Steven often leaned close to her ear to get closer to her. I heard, \"You have the braids of Laura Diané, Éléonore de Guérin, and of her descendant so beloved by Chateaubriand.\"\n[1897-09-27 01:02:34] Cliff | I saw it suddenly, the ring was in the hands of the boy next to Albertine, and Steven immediately rushed over, violently prying open his hand to seize the ring.\n[1897-09-27 01:02:44] Cliff | I saw him forced to go to the center of the circle, to Steven's original spot, while Steven took his place, sitting next to Albertine.\n[1897-09-27 01:02:54] Cliff | I thought back to just a few minutes earlier, when Steven had seen the young man's hand slip toward the small rope, almost touching Albertine's. Steven had been envious of the young man then; now it was Steven's turn.\n[1897-09-27 01:02:59] Cliff | I thought that Steven was too shy to seek such contact; he was too excited to truly experience the sensation of such a connection. All Steven felt was his heart beating violently and painfully.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:04] Cliff | I saw that, for a moment, Albertine would gently turn her plump, pink face toward Steven, pretending to hold a ring in her hand, in order to deceive the ermine and prevent him from looking in the direction where the ring was being passed.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:14] Cliff | I thought of Steven, and he immediately understood that the implication in Albertine's gaze referred to this trick.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:19] Cliff | I saw Steven, who had a look of secret and mutual understanding flickering in his eyes, merely for the sake of the game. I thought of Steven and felt completely unsettled; this secret, this understanding, did not exist between her and Steven.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:24] Cliff | I thought about it, but from this moment on, Steven felt that it was possible, and it seemed as sweet as heaven.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:29] Cliff | I saw this thought stirring Steven, and at that moment, Steven felt Albertine's hand gently pressing against his own. Her comforting fingers slid beneath his fingers.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:34] Cliff | I saw Steven seeing her, and she gave Steven a wink, trying to make it seem as if no one else noticed.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:44] Cliff | As I thought, a series of hopes that Steven himself had not yet clearly understood formed in his mind: \"She is using the game to make Steven feel that she really likes him.\" Steven was overjoyed, thinking this.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:49] Cliff | I heard, just then, Albertine angrily said to Steven: \"Come on, Steven, you've been handing it to me for an hour!\"\n[1897-09-27 01:03:54] Cliff | I thought of Steven, and my mood immediately sank.\n[1897-09-27 01:03:59] Cliff | I saw Steven looking sad and dazed, and I let go of the little rope. The ermine caught sight of the ring and rushed toward her.\n[1897-09-27 01:04:09] Cliff | I saw Steven forced to go again to the center of the circle, dejected, watching the mad circle continue to revolve around him.\n[1897-09-27 01:04:19] Cliff | I saw all the girls teasing Steven, questioning him, and in order to answer, Steven had to smile, but he didn't want to smile at all.\n[1897-09-27 01:04:29] Cliff | I heard Albertine keep saying, \"If you don't want to pay attention, don't play! If you're determined to make others lose, don't play! André, we won't invite him anymore for our games, or else Steven won't come.\"\n[1897-09-27 01:04:34] Cliff | I saw André standing apart from the game, still singing \"Mélisande,\" and Unknown_Rosemonde followed suit, singing along without any real conviction.\n[1897-09-27 01:04:44] Cliff | I saw Andre that he wanted to shift Albertine's blame. I heard her say to Steven, \"The view of Unknown_Creuniers you're so eager to see is just a few steps away. Come on, Steven, lead you down a beautiful little path, and let those crazy ones pretend to be eight-year-olds!\"\n[1897-09-27 20:33:19] Path | I saw that André showed great kindness to Steven, so on the way, Steven spoke about the very things that were peculiar to Albertine and that had been enough to make her fall in love with Steven.\n[1897-09-27 20:33:24] Path | I saw Andre saying to Steven that she also liked Albertine, and found her very moving. I thought, but it seemed that Steven's compliments to her girlfriend did not please her.\n[1897-09-27 20:33:29] Path | I saw him suddenly stop on the low path, and the warm memories of his childhood touched Steven's heart.\n[1897-09-27 20:33:34] Path | I saw the neatly trimmed, glistening branches reaching out over the roadside leaves. Steven recognized a cluster of hawthorn trees, but alas, their blossoms had already fallen since late spring.\n[1897-09-27 20:33:44] Path | I saw around Steven the lingering scent of the old Maria month, Sunday afternoons, forgotten faiths, and past mistakes. I thought of Steven and longed to seize that scent.\n[1897-09-27 20:33:59] Path | I saw Steven stop for a second, and with touching foresight, Andre invited Steven to speak with the leaves for a moment.\n[1897-09-27 20:34:09] Path | I saw Steven asking the leaves about the blossoms; the flowers of these hawthorn trees were similar to young girls of a lively, impulsive, flirtatious, yet pious nature. I heard the leaves say to Steven, \"These ladies have already left.\"\n[1897-09-27 20:34:14] Path | I thought perhaps the leaves were thinking, Steven claimed to be a close friend of these flowers, yet he didn't seem to know much about their way of life.\n[1897-09-27 20:34:19] Path | I thought of a dear friend, but it had been so many years since we had met again, although we had once made a promise.\n[1897-09-27 20:34:24] Path | I thought, but just as Michael was Steven's first love for a girl, these flowers were also Steven's first love for flowers.\n[1897-09-27 20:34:29] Path | I heard Steven answer, \"Yes, Steven knows, they're leaving around mid-June, but Steven is also happy to see the place where they've lived here.\"\n[1897-09-27 20:34:34] Path | I heard: \"They used to come to Sunrise to Steven's bedroom to see Steven, when Steven was sick, it was Steven's mother who brought them. Steven and his friends always met on Saturday nights in the month of Maria. Could they come here too?\"\n[1897-09-27 20:34:39] Path | I heard him say, \"Oh, of course! Besides, people place a lot of importance on seeing these young ladies at the Church of Saint-Denis in the Desert! The Church of Saint-Denis in the Desert is the nearest parish.\"\n[1897-09-27 20:34:44] Path | \"I heard, 'Well, now we have to see them?' 'Oh, it's not possible before May next year.'\"\n[1897-09-27 20:34:49] Path | I heard, \"Can we be sure they'll be here next year?\" \"They always come on time every year.\"\n[1897-09-27 20:34:54] Path | I heard, \"It's just that Steven doesn't know if Steven can still find this place.\" \"He will! Those girls are so cheerful, they only stop laughing when they sing hymns. You can tell their scent from the end of the path, and you'll never be wrong!\"\n[1897-09-28 01:43:17] Path | I saw Steven catch up with André, and once again praise Albertine in front of her.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:22] Path | I thought about how Steven had repeated it so many times, as if Steven believed she wouldn't repeat it in Albertine's presence. But later, Steven never heard Albertine say she knew about these things.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:27] Path | I thought that Andre's understanding of other people's affairs and his considerate treatment of others was far superior to Albertine's.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:32] Path | I thought of finding just the right look, words, and gestures to skillfully make people happy; a certain feeling might make someone uncomfortable, so I swallowed it down.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:37] Path | I thought of sacrificing an hour of play, even a whole morning, a garden party (which again didn't look like a sacrifice), to stay with a boyfriend or girlfriend in sorrow, showing him (or her) that she would rather be with him (or her) alone than enjoy those superficial pleasures, which was a noble sentiment she had become accustomed to.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:42] Path | I thought that when people learned more about her, one could almost say her situation was like that of small heroes who were originally very timid but did not want to show their fear; their bravery was all the more praiseworthy.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:47] Path | I thought that one could almost say this kindness was entirely absent from her nature, and that she displayed it at all times because of her noble spirit, her sensitive feelings, and her desire to appear as a loyal friend to others.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:52] Path | I thought about the relationship between Steven and Albertine, listening to her touching words to Steven, as if she would do everything possible to make Steven happy.\n[1897-09-28 01:43:57] Path | I thought, but perhaps by chance, she had never done a single thing that could have arranged or brought Steven and Albertine together.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:02] Path | I thought that Steven was not brave enough to swear that the efforts Steven had made to make Albertine fall in love with him had not, at the very least, caused some anger in her heart, even if they had not provoked any secret scheming in the heart of her friend.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:07] Path | I thought that of course this anger was well concealed, and perhaps, out of noble sentiments, she was also struggling against it herself.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:12] Path | I thought of André's many kind and considerate gestures, which Albertine was incapable of. Yet Steven could not be sure whether André was truly good-hearted deep down, just as he could not be sure afterward about Albertine's goodness.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:17] Path | I saw that Andre had a passionate but rather frivolous feeling for Albertine, and he always showed her kind and indulgent affection, speaking to her, smiling at her, with all the words and smiles of a lover.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:22] Path | I thought to myself that it was even worse, for she always acted as a friend.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:27] Path | I saw Steven, day after day, striving to impress her with even more devotion than a jester who seeks the favor of a monarch, and yet he gained nothing personal from it. I thought of how to make this poor friend enjoy her own luxury, to make this poor friend happy.\n[1897-09-28 01:44:32] Path | I found it moving that when others pitied Albertine's poverty before her, she was so gentle, her words sad and deeply touching, more so than when she dealt with a wealthy friend, and she took ten times more care.\n[1897-09-28 21:10:27] Path | I saw that if someone were to suggest that Albertine might not be as poor as people said, a barely perceptible cloud would pass over André's brow, and she seemed to feel unhappy.\n[1897-09-28 21:10:37] Path | I heard that if others were to say more, in the end, Albertine might not be as hard to marry off as people thought, and she would then strongly insist on the opposite, almost angrily repeating: \"It's a pity, she'll definitely never get married! Steven knows that, and it really hurts Steven's feelings!\"\n[1897-09-28 21:10:42] Path | I thought that even for Steven, she was the only one among these girls who had never said anything bad about Steven to him.\n[1897-09-28 21:10:47] Path | I saw even more, if it were Steven himself uttering these words, she would feign disbelief or offer an explanation that made them harmless. I thought of this series of advantages and called it \"clever.\"\n[1897-09-28 21:10:52] Path | I thought of people who, if the Stevenes were to challenge someone to a duel, would first congratulate the Stevenes and then add that there was no real reason for doing so, all in order to make the courage displayed by the Stevenes appear even greater in their eyes. The Stevenes weren't acting out of necessity; cleverness was the characteristic of such people.\n[1897-09-28 21:10:57] Path | I heard someone say the exact opposite of such a person: \"You must certainly hate dueling with people, but on the other hand, you can't help but take it personally; you have no choice but to do something about it.\" I thought that in everything, there are always things to say in favor and things to say against.\n[1897-09-28 21:11:02] Path | I thought that if Steven's friends repeated to Steven's face the hurtful things people had said about them, and were happy to do so or at least didn't care, it proved that when they spoke those words to Steven, they couldn't really put themselves in Steven's place, they didn't really love Steven, and they were stabbing and cutting Steven just as one would stab and cut an animal's intestinal membrane.\n[1897-09-28 21:11:07] Path | I thought of another kind of friend, the clever sort, who, upon hearing what people said about Steven or upon forming certain opinions about Steven's actions, would always conceal these from Steven, and this art of concealment proved their remarkable ability to hide things.\n[1897-09-28 21:11:12] Path | I thought that if they really didn't take things in a bad way, and if what people said made them uncomfortable, just as such words would make Stevens uncomfortable, then this kind of concealment was perfectly acceptable. Steven thought that André was in this situation, of course, though Steven wasn't absolutely certain.\n[1897-09-28 21:11:17] Path | I saw the Stevenes already having left the small woods, moving along a seldom-traveled path, and Andre did not turn at all.\n[1897-09-28 21:11:27] Path | I saw her suddenly say to Steven. I heard, \"Look, this is your wonderful Unknown_Creuniers. You're quite lucky, this is exactly the kind of weather and light that George painted.\"\n[1897-09-28 21:11:32] Path | I saw at once, beneath Steven's feet, the sea nymphs that George had glimpsed and caught sight of, hiding among the rocks and avoiding the heat.\n[1897-09-28 21:11:47] Path | I saw these beautiful, moving shadows, beneath a dark, translucent varnish that could rival a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. They were fleeting, nimble, silent, and always ready to dart beneath the stones as soon as the sunlight shifted, hiding in the crevices.\n[1897-09-28 21:12:02] Path | I saw that once the threat of sunlight had passed, these shadows quickly flew back to the cliffs or the seaweed.\n[1897-09-28 21:12:17] Path | I saw, under the sunbeams that had broken into patches on the colorless ocean and the cliffs, these shadows seemed once again to be guarding the rocks or the seaweed in a brief rest, motionless yet light, like watchful women, clinging to the surface with their tender, flesh-like bodies and focused dark eyes.\n[1897-09-28 21:12:32] Path | I thought it was a pity that Steven was still suffering from the fall he had taken from the pinnacle of hope during the game of guessing games, so Steven had not experienced the kind of happiness he might have felt if he had not been in that mood.",

    "text": "[1897-09-29 13:17:48] Balbec | I saw Steven and the other girls rejoin the group and set off back home.\n[1897-09-29 13:17:58] Balbec | I thought that now Steven knew that Steven loved Albertine, but fortunately, Steven wasn't worried about her finding out.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:03] Balbec | I thought about how, since the game on the Champs-Élysées, although Steven's loves have all been for people almost the same, his view of love had changed.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:08] Balbec | I thought that on one hand, confiding in and declaring my tenderness to Steven's beloved seemed to Steven no longer the most important and necessary moment of a love affair; love itself, it seemed, was no longer an external reality for Steven, but merely a subjective pleasure.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:13] Balbec | I thought of this happiness, Steven felt, and it was precisely because Albertine did not know that Steven would feel it that she was so happy to do everything necessary to maintain it.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:18] Balbec | I thought of the entire journey back, during which the radiance emanating from the other girls eclipsed Albertine's image, and to Steven, her image was not the only existence.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:23] Balbec Hotel | I thought, but just as the moon during the day is merely a more distinctive and fixed patch of cloud, and once the sunlight disappears, the moon reveals its full immense power, so after Steven returned to the hotel, only Albertine's image remained in his mind, rising up and radiating light.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:28] Balbec Hotel | I thought that Steven had suddenly felt that Steven's room had changed.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:33] Balbec Hotel | I thought, of course, this room was no longer the hostile room I had first encountered on the evening of my arrival.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:38] Balbec Hotel | I thought of the Stevens constantly changing their surroundings, and as the familiar became routine, they eliminated all the harmful colors, spaces, and smells that had once made them feel uncomfortable.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:43] Balbec Hotel | I thought that although this room still played a considerable role in Steven's emotions, it clearly no longer caused Steven pain, but instead brought him joy.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:48] Balbec Hotel | I saw it become a reservoir for happy days, like a swimming pool, where the happy days made a patch of blue, bathed in sunlight, shimmer like a mirror at the level of a person's height. The sunlight, invisible and intangible like heat radiation, was white and bright, once covering the reflection of a sailing ship that sped across the water.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:53] Balbec Hotel | I realized this room was no longer the pure, aesthetic room of the evening when I used to appreciate paintings.\n[1897-09-29 13:18:58] Balbec Hotel | I thought of this room, which Steven had been living in so long that he had now become blind to it.\n[1897-09-29 13:19:03] Balbec Hotel | I thought of it now, and Steven once again widened his eyes at it, but this time from the selfish and self-centered perspective of love.\n[1897-09-29 13:19:08] Balbec Hotel | I thought to myself, Steven, this beautiful slanted mirror, this luxurious glass bookcase— if Albertine came to see Steven, it would make a good impression on her of Steven.\n[1897-09-29 13:19:13] Balbec Hotel | I thought of Steven's room as a transitional place where he had spent a moment before fleeing to the beach or Springfield, and now Steven had become solid, very precious, and completely renewed, because Steven was viewing and appreciating each piece of furniture in the room through Albertine's eyes.\n[1897-09-30 02:52:38] Méry-sur-Marne | A few days after the ring-around-the-rosy game, the Stevenes went for a walk, strolling aimlessly until they wandered too far and finally found two small two-seater \"barrels\" in Maisons-Laffitte.\n[1897-09-30 02:52:48] Maisonville | I thought about how the two cars would make Steven come home for dinner, and everyone was really delighted.\n[1897-09-30 02:52:53] Maisonville | I saw Steven propose to Unknown_Rosemonde and then to André to ride in the same carriage with Steven, but never once did he suggest that Albertine join Steven in the carriage. I thought of how Steven had loved Albertine so intensely, and the result was this.\n[1897-09-30 02:52:58] Méry-sur-Thaon | I saw that later, Steven, while first inviting André or Unknown_Rosemonde, would let the others decide by considering secondary issues like time, route, and coats. The most practical solution was for Steven to ride in the same carriage as Albertine. I thought this seemed to go against Steven's wishes.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:03] Méry-sur-Marne | I saw that she had come to accompany Steven, and Steven pretended to reluctantly accept.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:13] Méry-sur-Seine | I thought it was a pity that love always tends to absorb a person completely, but through the method of conversation, no one can eat another.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:18] Carriage | I saw that during the journey home, Albertine was doing her utmost to be affectionate. I thought about it, but it was of no use.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:23] Balbec | I saw when Steven escorted her home, leaving Steven alone. I thought Steven was very happy, yet he desired her even more than when he had set out.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:28] Balbec | I thought that Steven saw the time we had just spent together as only an overture, which was not particularly important in itself compared to the time that would follow.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:33] Balbec | I thought of it, but it had the charm of the first time, which is gone forever.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:38] Balbec | I thought that Steven had not yet made any demands on Albertine, and she might already be imagining what Steven would ask of her, but she was not certain, and perhaps she assumed that Steven was only interested in a relationship without any clear purpose.\n[1897-09-30 02:53:43] Balbec | I thought that in such a relationship, Steven's girlfriend would find sweet, expectant little surprises, which is the essence of romantic sentiment.\n[1897-10-01 07:36:05] Balbec | I saw that during the following week, Steven didn't make any real effort to see Albertine; he pretended to prefer Andre.\n[1897-10-02 08:12:33] Balbec | I thought about how, at the beginning of a love affair, one wishes to retain the image of a stranger in the eyes of the woman one loves.\n[1897-10-02 08:12:38] Balbec | I thought that people both needed her and wanted to be more in contact with her attention, her heart, even more than with her body.\n[1897-10-02 08:12:43] Balbec | I thought of a letter in which someone, unintentionally, writes a harsh word, which would force that indifferent woman to ask for your passion.\n[1897-10-02 08:12:48] Balbec | I thought about love, which, according to a necessarily effective technique, for Stevenes is to tighten the gear system through a double movement. Within this meshing of gears, Stevenes can no longer fail to love, nor can they be loved anymore.\n[1897-10-02 08:12:53] Balbec | I saw others going to some daytime gatherings, and Steven gave that time to André. I thought that Steven, out of happiness, would be willing to sacrifice this gathering for Steven, and she might even feel annoyed, sacrificing these few hours out of noble sentiment for Steven, in order not to let anyone, or even herself, think that she valued the relatively social happiness too much.\n[1897-10-02 08:12:58] Balbec | I saw that Steven had arranged to be alone with her every evening. I wasn't thinking so much of making Albertine jealous, but rather of raising Steven's own prestige in her eyes, or at least not diminishing my own authority when I told Albertine that Steven loved her, not André.\n[1897-10-02 08:13:03] Balbec | When I saw that, Steven didn't say anything to André. I thought of worrying that she might repeat what she'd said in Albertine's presence.\n[1897-10-02 08:13:08] Balbec | I saw Steven talking to Andre with pretended indifference about Albertine. I thought Steven had been taken in by her superficial trust, and her feigned indifference toward Steven probably wouldn't fool him.\n[1897-10-02 08:13:13] Balbec | I thought about how she pretended to believe that Steven was indifferent to Albertine, pretended to hope that Albertine and Steven would perfectly combine, when in fact it was probably the opposite: she didn't really believe that Steven was indifferent to Albertine, nor did she wish for Steven and Albertine to perfectly combine.\n[1897-10-02 08:13:18] Balbec | I thought of the moment when Steven told her that he didn't care about her girlfriend, yet all he was thinking about was desperately trying to make contact with Madame Bontemps.\n[1897-10-03 08:49:46] Balbec | I know that Madame Bontemps is staying for a few days near Riverside, and Albertine will probably go to her house for three days.\n[1897-10-03 08:50:06] Balbec | When I saw Steven talking about Albertine's family, he looked completely indifferent. I thought, of course, that Steven didn't let André detect this desire, and André's clear-cut answers didn't reveal any suspicion on her part regarding Steven's sincerity.\n[1897-10-03 08:50:11] Balbec | I heard her say one day, \"Steven just happened to see Aunt Albertine.\"",

Of course, she didn't say to Steven: \"The things you seem to say by chance, Steven has managed to make sense of them, Steven knows that you've wanted all along to get close to Aunt Albertine.\"\n[1897-10-04 10:48:27] Balbec | I thought, but in André's mind, this idea was clearly present; she thought it better to hide it from Steven, and the word \"just\" seemed to be associated with this idea.\n[1897-10-04 10:48:32] Balbec | I thought of certain looks, certain gestures, which, although they did not have a logical, rational form, nor a form specifically designed for the listener's intellect, would still make him understand their true meaning, just as human speech is first transformed into electricity on the telephone and then back into speech that can be heard.\n[1897-10-04 10:48:37] Balbec | I thought that \"just right\" belonged to this family.\n[1897-10-04 10:48:42] Balbec | When I saw Steven talking about this lady, he was not only distracted but also had a malicious tone. Steven said he had met women like this before, and he hoped never to encounter such a thing again. I thought about how, in order to erase from André's mind the idea that Steven was interested in Madame Bontemps, it was actually the opposite—Steven was doing everything he could to meet her.\n[1897-10-05 14:09:21] Elstir's Studio | I saw Steven desperately trying to get George to speak about himself in front of Madame Bontemps, and he wanted Steven to meet her.\n[1897-10-05 14:09:31] Elstir's Studio | I saw that Steven didn't tell anyone that Steven had asked George to do this.\n[1897-10-05 14:09:41] Elstir's Studio | I saw George agree to let Steven meet her, but he was completely puzzled by Steven's desire to do so. I thought that he considered this lady a despicable, scheming woman, without any sense of humor and greedy for money.\n[1897-10-05 14:09:46] Balbec | I thought of Steven, and if Steven met Madame Bontemps, André would eventually find out, so Steven thought it would be best to remind her.\n[1897-10-06 06:34:01] Balbec | I heard Steven say to her, \"What is it? The more you try to avoid it, the more unavoidable it becomes. There's nothing in the world that makes Steven more tired than meeting Madame Bongar. But Steven can't get out of it this time; George probably wants to have him meet her as well.\"\n[1897-10-06 06:34:06] Balbec | \"I heard 'Steven never doubted it for a moment,' \" André cried out, his voice full of bitterness. I saw her vacant eyes, wide with dissatisfaction, staring fixedly at something invisible.\n[1897-10-06 06:34:11] Balbec | I thought that Andre's words did not yet amount to a clear and coherent expression of the idea, which could be summarized as: \"Steven clearly knows that you love Albertine, and you are doing everything you can to get close to her family.\"\n[1897-10-06 06:34:16] Balbec | I thought of it, and her words were the unformed, scattered fragments of this thought, capable of being reassembled. Steven touched upon this idea, bringing it to light, though Andre was not doing so intentionally.\n[1897-10-06 06:34:21] Balbec | I thought of how, just like what Steven had said earlier about \"exactly,\" these words only had meaning on the second level. Some words (not direct affirmations) made Stevenes feel respect or suspicion toward someone, causing them to feel out of place with that person—André's words were of this kind.\n[1897-10-06 06:34:26] Balbec | I saw Steven tell Andre, that Steven was indifferent to Albertine's family, and Andre didn't believe Steven's words. I thought it was because she believed Steven loved Albertine, and probably felt unhappy about it.\n[1897-10-07 15:23:12] Balbec | I had noticed that generally, when Steven was meeting his girlfriend, she was always present as a third party; yet there were also days when Steven saw Albertine alone.\n[1897-10-07 15:23:22] Balbec | I thought of Steven waiting eagerly for such days, but as time passed, nothing decisive came from them, nor did they become the kind of important day that Steven would immediately entrust to the next day, and the next day was no more significant than the one before.\n[1897-10-07 15:23:27] Balbec | I thought of how days simply passed one after another, like the waves of the sea, with each new wave pushing the one before it.\n[1897-10-07 15:23:32] Balbec | I knew that about a month had passed since the day Steven and his friends played the ring game, when someone told Steven that Albertine was leaving the next morning to spend forty-eight hours at Madame Bontemps's.\n[1897-10-07 15:23:52] Balbec | I knew she had to take the early morning train, so she had to stay overnight at a big hotel, which meant that the next morning she could take a public carriage from the hotel to catch the first train, without disturbing the friends of the family she was staying with.\n[1897-10-07 15:24:12] Balbec | I saw Steven talking about it with Andre.\n[1897-10-07 15:24:22] Balbec | \"I don't believe Steven at all,\" André answered Steven. I saw a face full of unhappiness.\n[1897-10-07 15:24:27] Balbec | \"I heard, 'Besides, it won't do you any good, Steven. Albertine would definitely not want to see you if she came to the hotel alone—it's not proper.' \"\n[1897-10-07 15:24:32] Balbec | I heard her add another sentence, using a word she had recently taken to lovingly employ, which meant \"such things are not done\": \"Steven said that about you because Steven knows Albertine's thoughts. As for Steven personally, whether you see her or not, what does it matter to Steven? It has nothing to do with Steven at all.\"\n[1897-10-07 15:24:37] Balbec | I saw that at this moment Octave met Steven and his group. He casually told Andre the number of points he had scored the day before on the golf course, and how many Albertine had scored.\n[1897-10-08 14:58:40] Balbec | I saw Albertine walking and, like a nun fiddling with her rosary, fiddling with her racket. Fortunately, there was this game, which allowed her to be alone for hours without getting bored.\n[1897-10-08 14:58:45] Balbec | I saw her arrive and join Steven and his friends, and the mischievous tip of her nose appeared before Steven. I thought of how, these past few days, Steven had forgotten her mischievous little nose.\n[1897-10-08 14:58:50] Balbec | I saw her dark hair, with a straight forehead beneath it. I had experienced this contrast between the inaccurate image I had kept of Steven and the reality before, and it was not the first time.\n[1897-10-08 14:58:55] Balbec | I saw the pale skin on his brow, which once again held Steven's gaze.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:00] Balbec | I thought of Albertine emerging from the dust of memory, reappearing before Steven.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:05] Balbec | I thought about how playing golf makes one accustomed to the pleasure of solitude, and the pleasure of the club must be just the same.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:10] Balbec | When I saw Albertine with the Stevenes, she chatted with them while continuing to play ball, just like a woman whose friend came to visit her, and she didn't stop knitting because of it.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:15] Balbec | I heard her say to Octave, \"It's said that Madame de Charles has protested to your James.\"\n[1897-10-08 14:59:20] Balbec | I thought that Steven had heard, from the words \"it is said,\" a particular note belonging to Albertine, and each time Steven realized he had forgotten these notes, he would simultaneously recall the resolute and Frenchified expression of Albertine that had once vaguely appeared behind them.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:25] Balbec | I thought that even if Steven were blind, he could still recognize some of her clever and provincial characteristics from these notes and the tip of her nose.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:30] Balbec | I thought that notes and the tip of the nose were both valuable, perhaps even complementary, and her voice, like a future television telephone, clearly projected visual images within the sound.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:35] Balbec | I heard, \"She didn't just write to your James, but also to the mayor of Riverside, asking people not to play polo on the seafront anymore, because a polo ball had fallen on her face.\"\n[1897-10-08 14:59:40] Balbec | \"I heard, 'Yes, Steven heard about this protest, it's ridiculous, there's not much entertainment left here anymore.'\"\n[1897-10-08 14:59:45] Balbec | I saw that André did not speak. I knew she didn't know Charles, in fact Albertine and Octave also didn't know Charles.\n[1897-10-08 14:59:50] Balbec | I saw that André still spoke. I heard, \"I don't understand why this lady is making such a big deal out of it. Madame de Cambremont also took a hit, and she didn't even protest!\"\n[1897-10-08 14:59:55] Balbec | I saw Octave, his face serious, rubbing a matchstick and answering. I heard, \"Steven will explain the difference to you. It's because, in Steven's eyes, Madame de Cambremer is a courtesan, and Charles is a nouveau riche.\"\n[1897-10-08 15:00:00] Balbec | I saw him leave Steven's group, and Andre also left. I heard, \"Are you guys going to play golf this afternoon?\"\n[1897-10-08 20:42:57] Balbec | I saw Steven left alone with Albertine.\n[1897-10-08 20:43:02] Balbec | I heard her say to Steven, \"Look, now Steven has styled his hair the way you like, look at this strand of Steven's hair!\"\n[1897-10-08 20:43:07] Balbec | I heard \"No one is laughing at this, but no one knows for whom Steven is doing it. Steven's aunt will certainly laugh at Steven too, of course, and Steven won't tell her why.\"\n[1897-10-09 07:59:30] Balbec | I saw Steven looking at Albertine's cheeks from the side. I saw her cheeks often looked pale, but this gave them the nourishment of light blood, which illuminated her cheeks and made them shine.\n[1897-10-09 07:59:35] Balbec | I thought of certain winter mornings that also shone like this, with stones partially illuminated by sunlight appearing like pink marble, radiating a joyful glow.\n[1897-10-09 07:59:40] Balbec | I thought at that moment that seeing Albertine's cheeks gave Steven great pleasure, but this pleasure led to a different desire, not the wish to go for a walk, but the desire to kiss her.\n[1897-10-09 07:59:45] Balbec | I saw Steven ask her whether the plans that had been mentioned were true.\n[1897-10-09 07:59:50] Balbec | I heard her say to Steven, \"Yes, Steven is spending the night at your hotel tonight. Steven has a cold, and even before dinner, Steven is going to bed.\"\n[1897-10-09 07:59:55] Balbec | I heard, \"You can come to Steven's bed to watch Steven have dinner, and then we'll play for a while. Whatever you want to play, we'll play it.\"\n[1897-10-09 08:00:00] Balbec | I heard, \"If you come to the station tomorrow morning, Steven would be very happy, but Steven is afraid it might seem odd. Steven didn't mean Andre, she's smart; Steven was talking about someone else going to the station.\"\n[1897-10-09 08:00:05] Location: Balbec | I heard that someone told Steven's aunt, which would become gossip again, but Steven and his friends could spend the evening together, and Steven's aunt wouldn't know a thing.\n[1897-10-09 08:00:10] Balbec | I saw her smile again and add a sentence. I heard, \"Steven is going to say goodbye to André. Okay, see you soon, come early, we have plenty of time.\"\n[1897-10-10 00:42:27] Balbec | I thought of the words I had heard, and Steven was once again in the period before he loved Michael, back to the time when Steven felt that love was not just an external whole, but something that could be realized.\n[1897-10-10 00:42:32] Balbec | I thought of Michael as Steven had seen her on the Champs-Élysées, a Michael entirely different from the one who reappeared in Steven's mind when he was alone.\n[1897-10-10 00:42:37] Balbec | I thought that suddenly, the imagined Albertine, the Albertine whom Steven had not yet met, the Albertine whom Steven imagined was secretly watching him on the seafront, the Albertine who looked unhappy as Steven walked away, had turned into the real Albertine, the Albertine Steven saw every day.\n[1897-10-10 00:42:42] Balbec | I thought that Steven had originally believed she was full of bourgeois prejudices, and had been especially open with her aunt!\n[1897-10-10 00:42:47] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven going to have dinner with David, and I felt that there was a secret in my heart that she did not know about.\n[1897-10-10 00:42:52] Balbec Hotel | I thought that, for Albertine, tomorrow when her girlfriends were with her, they would not know what had just happened among the Stevenes.\n[1897-10-10 00:42:57] Balbec Hotel | I thought of how Madame Bontemps, when she kissed her niece's forehead, had no idea that between the two of them there was also a Steven. The way the girl had styled her hair was to please Steven, and this purpose was kept secret from everyone.\n[1897-10-10 00:43:02] Balbec Hotel | I thought that up until then, Steven had been so envious of Madame Bongar, because her relatives were also her niece's relatives; she mourned for the same people her niece did; and wherever she visited her relatives, her niece also went to visit the same relatives.\n[1897-10-10 00:43:07] Balbec Hotel | I thought that, by chance, Steven was better than her aunt herself in Albertine's eyes, and when she was with her aunt, what she would miss would be Steven.\n[1897-10-10 00:43:12] Balbec Hotel | I had thought about what would happen shortly after, but Steven wasn't exactly sure. In any case, this grand hotel, this night, no longer seemed empty to Steven; they contained Steven's happiness.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:22] Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven ring the bell to summon the elevator operator, so he could go up to the room Albertine had rented, which was on the side of the valley.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:27] Elevator of the Balbec Hotel | I thought of any small action, such as sitting on the bench in an elevator, and Steven found them so sweet, so intimately connected to his heart.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:32] Elevator of the Balbec Hotel | I thought of the elevator cables that allowed one to ascend, and the few steps one had to take after getting out of the elevator. To Steven, these were simply the materialization of his joy into gears and steps.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:37] Corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I thought that if Steven took just two or three more steps down this corridor, he would reach the room, where the precious essence of that rosy body was hidden.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:42] Corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I thought of that room, which, even if something sweet were to happen within it, would afterward remain the same as ever. To an outsider who knew nothing about it, the room would still be no different from any other room.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:47] Corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I thought of all these rooms, where the objects had become silent witnesses, careful and cautious confidants, and inviolable keepers of happiness.\n[1897-10-11 00:43:52] Corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I saw those steps from the staircase to Albertine's room, those inevitable steps that no one could stop anymore, and Steven walked them with joy and care. I thought I had plunged into a new environment, as if Steven, with every step he took, was slowly moving forward in happiness, while at the same time I felt an immense and previously unknown sensation, as though I had finally entered the inheritance that had always been meant for Steven.",

    "text": "[1897-10-11 00:43:57] The corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I saw Steven jumping up and down with joy. I thought of Steven, and suddenly realized that Steven should have had no suspicions. She had told Steven to come after she was in bed, which was perfectly clear.\n[1897-10-11 00:44:07] Corridor of the Balbec Hotel | I saw Françoise on the road and nearly knocked her over, and Steven's eyes lit up as he ran to his girlfriend's room.\n[1897-10-11 05:13:17] Albertine's room | I saw Steven looking at Albertine lying in bed. I saw before me a white blouse revealing her neck, which altered the proportions of her face.\n[1897-10-11 05:13:27] Albertine's Room | I saw that perhaps it was the bed, or perhaps the cold, or may be dinner that had made her face more flushed, more radiant than a peach blossom. I thought of Steven and the look on his face that I had seen several hours earlier on the seawall, and now I was finally about to find out what this beauty tasted like.\n[1897-10-11 05:13:32] Albertine's Room | I saw her two dark, curly braids, which had been completely undone to please Steven, one of them running from top to bottom across her cheek.\n[1897-10-11 05:13:47] Albertine's room | I saw her smiling at Steven. I saw her beside the window, where the bright moonlight illuminated the valley.\n[1897-10-11 05:13:57] Albertine's room | I thought of seeing Albertine's bare neck and her cheeks, which were more beautiful than roses, and how Steven was so enraptured (meaning that, for Steven, the real world was no longer in nature, but rather in a torrent of sensations, to the point where Steven could hardly control himself).\n[1897-10-11 05:14:02] Albertine's room | I thought of this meeting as having completely shattered the balance between the vast, impregnable life within Steven and the fragile cosmic life in comparison.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:07] Albertine's Room | I saw from the window, Steven faintly glimpsed the sea beside the valley, the swelling breasts of the highest cliffs at Ménival, and the night sky before the moon had reached its zenith.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:22] Albertine's room | I thought that, compared to the downy hair around Steven's eyes, Steven seemed to find everything lighter.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:27] Albertine's room | I thought of Steven, whose eyelashes had already begun to swell up, firm and strong, ready to lift many other heavy things upon their tender surface, the world's mountains and hills.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:32] Albertine's room | I thought that the hemisphere of the horizon itself was no longer enough to fill this downy celestial body.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:37] Albertine's room | I thought that compared to the deep breath that filled Steven's chest, all the life that the Creator could grant Steven seemed very faint to Steven, and the breath of the sea had become so short in his eyes.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:42] Albertine's room | I saw Steven lean down toward Albertine to embrace her. I thought that at this moment, death would come to Steven, and Steven would not care at all.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:47] Albertine's room | I thought, more precisely, that Steven felt it was impossible, because life was not outside Steven, but inside Steven.\n[1897-10-11 05:14:52] Albertine's Room | I thought that if, at this moment, a philosopher were to explain his ideas, saying that one day, even a distant day, Steven would die; while the eternal power of nature would still continue to live, Steven would surely smile with compassion at him!\n[1897-10-11 05:14:57] Albertine's room | How could that be? How could the world exist longer than Steven, since Steven was not lost in the world, but rather the world was locked within Steven's heart, and the world could never possibly fill Steven's heart.\n[1897-10-11 05:15:02] Albertine's Room | I thought that Steven felt there was still room in his heart for countless other treasures, and Steven would contemptuously throw the sky, the sea, and the cliffs into a corner.\n[1897-10-11 05:15:07] Albertine's room | I saw Albertine scream as Steven rushed toward her to kiss her. I heard, \"Hurry up, or else Steven will ring the bell!\"\n[1897-10-11 05:15:12] Albertine's room | I thought, but in Steven's view, a girl sending a young man secretly to meet her, keeping it from her aunt, surely wasn't doing it for nothing; someone who knows how to seize the right moment can succeed if they have the courage.\n[1897-10-11 05:15:17] Albertine's room | I saw Albertine's round face illuminated by the inner flame, as if lit by a small lamp that had burned all night. I thought of Steven in such an excited state, and to Steven she was so three-dimensional that, in his eyes, she turned as if imitating the rotation of a globe, like Michelangelo's figures carried away by a static yet dizzying whirlwind.\n[1897-10-11 05:15:22] Albertine's room | I thought of this never-before-tasted pink fruit, what it would smell like, what it would taste like—I was about to find out, Steven!\n[1897-10-12 06:28:02] Albertine's room | I saw Albertine had summoned all her strength to pull the bell. I saw it just then, and Steven heard a sharp, continuous, and grating sound.\n[1897-10-12 07:43:46] Balbec | I thought back to how Steven had always believed that his love for Albertine was not based on the desire for physical possession.\n[1897-10-12 07:43:51] Balbec | I thought, but the result of that evening's attempt was that, in Steven's eyes, such possession had become impossible.\n[1897-10-12 07:43:56] Balbec | I thought back to the first day on the seawall when I saw her, and Steven had already suspected she was a loose woman. Then, through various intermediate assumptions, Steven seemed finally to have confirmed that she was absolutely pure and spotless.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:01] Balbec | I heard about it a week later, after she returned from her aunt's house. She coldly said to Steven: \"Steven, I have forgiven you, and I even feel sorry for having made you sad, but never, ever do that again!\"\n[1897-10-12 07:44:06] Balbec | It occurred to me that this was the exact opposite of what Richard had told Steven, that one could have any woman one wanted; it seemed as though Steven were not seeing a real, living girl, but rather a wax doll.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:11] Balbec | I realized that from then on, Steven's desire to enter her life, to follow her to the land where she had spent her childhood, and to begin living under her guidance would gradually grow distant from her.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:16] Balbec | I had never felt a more urgent desire to know what she thought about something, nor had I ever clung more firmly to the belief that Steven could kiss her.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:21] Balbec | I thought that once the desire for possession stopped feeding Steven's dream, the dream would abandon her, whereas Steven had always believed this dream to be independent of the desire for possession.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:26] Balbec | I thought that from now on, these fantasies would once again be free, transferring to one of Albertine's girlfriends, first and foremost to Andre--depending on the charm Steven found in a particular girlfriend on any given day, and especially on the possibilities and opportunities that Steven faintly glimpsed as being available to him through her.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:31] Balbec | I thought, even if there had been no affair with Albertine, in the days that followed, Steven probably would not have grown any happier about Andre's growing attentiveness toward him.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:36] Balbec | I knew about Steven's failure with Albertine, which she had never told anyone about.\n[1897-10-12 07:44:56] Balbec | I thought of some pretty young girls who, once they reach adolescence, are always more beloved than women who are more beautiful and wealthier--this is true at home, among friends, and in society.\n[1897-10-12 07:45:01] Balbec | I thought it was certainly because of their beautiful looks, but even more because of their mysteriously joyful and fascinating charm—the source of which probably lay in their endless vitality, and people who had not been so generously blessed by the Creator came to them to quench their thirst. Albertine was one of these people.\n[1897-10-12 07:45:06] Balbec | I thought of some girls who, not yet of an age to love—and even worse, once they are—were asked to give far more than they could possibly offer, even things they couldn't possibly give. She was one of them.\n[1897-10-12 07:45:11] Balbec | I knew that from childhood, Albertine had had four or five admirers around her, among them André, who was far superior to her, and André himself was fully aware of this. I thought that perhaps it was precisely the kind of unconscious attractiveness that Albertine had for people that helped her, becoming the very root of this little group.\n[1897-10-12 07:45:16] Balbec | I knew that this kind of attraction even extended quite far, reaching relatively more prominent social circles: if they wanted to perform the peacock dance, they would rather invite Albertine than a girl from an aristocratic family.\n[1897-10-12 07:45:36] Balbec | I knew the outcome would be that, although she had no dowry and lived in poverty, sustained by Monsieur Bongard, who was said to be dishonest and eager to get rid of her, she was still invited to dinner, and even offered a place to stay in someone's home.\n[1897-10-12 07:45:56] Balbec | I thought that to Peter's eyes, these people who had invited Albertine probably had no shine at all, but to Rosamund or Andre's Robert—women who were also wealthy, but who didn't know these people—these people represented considerable power.\n[1897-10-12 07:46:01] Balbec | I know that like this, Albertine spent several weeks each year in the homes of a president of the Banque de France and a director of a major railway company.\n[1897-10-12 07:46:21] Balbec | I knew that the wife of a financial magnate received important guests, but she never told Robert on which day was her \"reception day\" for Andre.\n[1897-10-12 07:46:41] Balbec | I thought that André's Robert found the woman very rude, yet she still took great interest in everything that happened in her family.\n[1897-10-12 07:46:46] Balbec | I saw her urging André to invite Albertine to their villa every year. I heard her say, \"It's a kind act to offer a girl who can't afford to travel and whose aunt isn't taking care of her the chance to spend a few days by the sea.\"\n[1897-10-12 07:46:51] Balbec | I thought that Robert's actions probably had nothing to do with wanting the bank president and his wife to learn how much she and her daughter loved Albertine, so that they would develop a liking for the two of them.\n[1897-10-12 07:46:56] Balbec | I thought she certainly wouldn't expect the kind and honest Albertine to have invited her, or at least to have invited Andre to the financier's garden party.\n[1897-10-13 01:42:47] Balbec | Every evening at dinner, I saw her act as if she didn't care, yet she listened with great interest as Albertine told her about the events that had taken place in the financier's castle, the people who had been there, and so on.\n[1897-10-13 01:42:52] Balbec | I thought of these people, almost all of whom she had either seen or heard about, and even the idea that Albertine had only known them in this way—that is, without really understanding them (she called this knowing \"people from all ages\")—caused Robert some sadness.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:02] Balbec | I saw her look down on them with an air of arrogance and indifference, asking Albertine some contemptuous questions about them.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:07] Balbec | I heard her say, \"Tell the cook that the peas aren't tender enough.\" I thought about it and thus confirmed my own position, and once again found myself back in \"real life,\" and this lady, possibly losing hold of her important position, might feel anxious.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:12] Balbec | I thought that after saying those words, the lady would return to her calm.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:17] Balbec | I thought to myself that she had long since made up her mind that André must marry someone, a man of high birth and considerable wealth, so that André could also have a cook and two coachmen, someone with status, someone who actually had real things.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:22] Balbec | I thought about how Albertine was having dinner at the castle of the bank president with some Madame so-and-so, a woman who had even invited her to spend the next winter, and in Robert's eyes, this was enough to make one respect this girl.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:27] Balbec | I thought of this reverent respect, which was intertwined with the pity and even contempt that her misfortunes inspired.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:32] Balbec | I thought of the contempt that became even more intense because M. Bonneval had betrayed his original side by joining the cabinet—there were vague rumors that he was a Panamaist—and this contempt was all the more bitter.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:37] Balbec | I saw it, but that didn't stop Robert from looking down on those who seemed to think Albertine came from a low background, out of her love for the truth.",

Her background couldn't be better, she's a Cimone, with just one 'n'!\"\n[1897-10-13 01:43:47] Balbec | I thought of nature, of all these things happening in a society where money played such an important role, a society where charm could get you an invitation, but not a marriage.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:52] Balbec | I thought that although Albertine had received such special favor, this favor was not enough to compensate for her poverty, and the beneficial effects of this favor seemed to offer Albertine absolutely no \"decent\" marriage.\n[1897-10-13 01:43:57] Balbec | I knew that this \"showing off,\" even if it did not offer the hope of a successful marriage, had already aroused the envy of certain ill-intentioned people, Robert. I thought of how they would receive Albertine as if she were a \"family member,\" even when they barely knew the wife of the bank president or Andre's Robert, and how each of them would be absolutely furious about it.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:07] Balbec | I saw them saying to their mutual friend and to the mutual friend of the two ladies, that if the two ladies were to learn the truth, they would be furious.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:27] Balbec | I knew that the truth was that Albertine had told everything she had discovered at this place (and vice versa), and because people had received her with an undue degree of intimacy, she had come by these discoveries.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:32] Balbec | I thought of all these little secrets, which would be uncomfortable for the people involved to see revealed.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:37] Balbec | I thought of these jealous women uttering such words, their sole purpose being to have someone relay the message, thus causing a rift between Albertine and her protector.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:42] Balbec | I thought about it, but as often happens, when you ask someone to do something, it never gets done. The malicious intent behind their actions was too obvious, and in the end, it only made people despise women who harbored such thoughts even more.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:47] Balbec | I thought of André's Robert, whose opinion of Albertine had already been fixed and would never change; she saw Albertine as a \"poor child,\" naturally good-hearted, who only came up with all sorts of schemes to be liked.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:52] Balbec | I thought about Albertine's fleeting popularity, which seemed to yield no real results, yet somehow gave the characteristics of certain people to Andre's girlfriend.\n[1897-10-13 01:44:57] Balbec | I thought about how these people had always been the objects of others' pursuit, never needing to go after someone themselves (this same kind of personality could also be found among certain attractive women on the other end of society, for the same reasons), yet they never boasted about the attention others paid them; rather, they always kept it hidden.\n[1897-10-13 01:45:02] Balbec | When someone spoke of so-and-so, she never said, \"He really wants to see Steven.\"\n[1897-10-13 01:45:07] Balbec | I saw that when she spoke of anyone, she did so with great kindness, as if she were pursuing them.\n[1897-10-13 01:45:12] Balbec | I saw a young man who had just scolded her in front of everyone because she had refused to go out with him. When talking about this young man, instead of boasting about it or blaming him publicly, she actually praised him. I heard, \"This young man is really enthusiastic!\"\n[1897-10-13 01:45:17] Balbec | I thought how she even felt troubled by the fact that she was so likable, because in that case she inevitably had to make people sad, yet her nature was to make people happy.\n[1897-10-13 01:45:22] Balbec | I thought of how she liked to make people happy, even to the point of using lies that only those who are purely self-serving or those who have climbed to high positions usually employ.\n[1897-10-13 01:45:27] Balbec | I thought that this insincerity actually exists in a rudimentary form in many people, and its content is simply not being satisfied with doing something just to please one person.\n[1897-10-13 01:45:32] Balbec | I thought, for example, that if Albertine's aunt wanted her niece to accompany her to a dull daytime gathering, Albertine went, and she should have been satisfied with the spiritual gain of making her aunt happy.\n[1897-10-13 01:45:37] Balbec | I saw that, but when she was warmly received by the host of the gathering, she preferred to say so to them. \"I heard that Steven has long wanted to meet you, so he chose this opportunity and obtained his aunt's permission to come.\"\n[1897-10-13 01:45:42] Balbec | I saw that wasn't enough: at this gathering, there was a girlfriend of Albertine's who had just gone through a breakup, and Albertine was going to speak to her. I heard, \"Steven doesn't want you to be alone. Steven thinks that if he were here with you, you might feel better. If you want us to leave this gathering and go somewhere else, just say the word, and Steven will do as you wish. The most important thing is that Steven wants to see you feeling better.\"\n[1897-10-13 01:45:47] Balbec | I thought that sometimes, the false purpose ruins the true one.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:07] Balbec | I knew that Albertine had to go and ask someone to do a favor for one of her girlfriends, and that was why she had gone to visit a certain lady.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:12] Balbec | I thought that once I arrived at this kind and enthusiastic lady's house, this girl, without realizing it, would follow her own principle of \"making the most of each situation,\" feeling that it would be more sincere to appear solely because I was so happy to see this lady.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:17] Balbec | I was deeply moved by the thought of this lady traveling such a long distance just for friendship with Albertine, and Albertine, almost moved by this lady, grew even more fond of her.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:22] Balbec | I thought, but the problem was here: she had claimed to have come purely out of friendship, and she felt so strongly the joy of friendship. If she had asked this lady to help on behalf of her friend, she would have worried that this lady might suspect her feelings.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:27] Balbec | I thought that, in fact, she was sincere; the lady would think that Albertine had come for this matter, which was true, but she would conclude that Albertine was pleased to see her, not without some calculation of advantage or loss, which was not accurate.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:32] Balbec | I saw that Albertine left without asking for help. I thought of those men who are extremely attentive to a woman, hoping to win her favor, yet who refrain from declaring their love in order to keep such passion in a noble and elevated state.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:37] Balbec | I thought that, in other situations, it couldn't be said that she always sacrificed the real purpose for a secondary, afterthought goal.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:42] Balbec | I thought that the real purpose was directly opposed to the secondary one; if Albertine had revealed this purpose to that person, moving him deeply, then when she learned of the other purpose, her joy would immediately turn into the deepest sorrow.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:47] Balbec | I thought about continuing the story, which would make this kind of contradiction even clearer.\n[1897-10-13 01:46:52] Balbec | I thought of the examples of Stevens, which are entirely different in type, and they can illustrate how such contradictions are everywhere in the various situations life presents.\n[1897-10-13 08:28:53] Balbec | I know of a husband who has settled his mistress in the city where he is stationed, while his wife remains in Willowbrook, hearing something of the truth, and feeling very distressed, she writes him several jealous letters.\n[1897-10-13 08:29:13] Balbec | I knew that the mistress had to come to Willowbrook for a day, and she begged him to accompany her. The husband could not resist, so he took a twenty-four-hour leave of absence.\n[1897-10-13 08:29:33] Balbec | I know, but he had a good heart. He felt guilty for making his wife unhappy, so after arriving in Willowbrook, he went to see her, and with sincere tears in his eyes, he told her that reading her letter had completely upset him, and he had managed to escape for a day just to come comfort her and embrace her.\n[1897-10-13 08:29:53] Balbec | I know that, and so he came up with a plan, proving his love to both his mistress and his wife at the same time through a trip.\n[1897-10-13 08:30:13] Balbec | I thought, but if his wife found out the real reason he had come to Willowbrook, her happiness would surely turn into suffering, unless this ungrateful fellow somehow made her feel more happiness than the pain caused by his lie.\n[1897-10-13 08:30:18] Balbec | I thought that, according to Steven's view, the person who most consistently used this \"multipurpose purpose\" system should be Paul.\n[1897-10-13 08:30:23] Balbec | I know that sometimes he took on the task of mediating between two friends who had quarreled, in order to gain the reputation of being \"the mostenthusiastic person.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:30:43] Balbec | I know that in front of the people who came to ask for his help, he was not content with merely appearingenthusiasticly helpful; he also had to present his mediation as something he did not do because of their request, but rather out of concern for the interests of the other party.\n[1897-10-13 08:31:03] Balbec | I knew that in this way he would easily persuade the other person, having previously given him a hint that the person standing before him was \"the most helpful one.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:31:23] Balbec | I know that by playing both sides, doing what is called in slang \"looking good on both sides,\" his reputation would not be at all jeopardized.\n[1897-10-13 08:31:43] Balbec | I knew that what he had actually done was not a concession, but rather the fruit of his own prestige.\n[1897-10-13 08:32:03] Balbec | I knew that, on the other hand, every favor he did seemed to be beneficial to both sides, which only added to his reputation as a helpful friend, and a very effective one, not like trying to cut water with a sword, but rather each mediation was successful.\n[1897-10-13 08:32:23] Balbec | I knew this showed that both parties were deeply grateful to him.\n[1897-10-13 08:32:43] Balbec | I knew that the insincerity inherent in such helpfulness, combined with the various contradictions present in anyone, was an essential part of Paul's character.\n[1897-10-13 08:32:48] Balbec | I knew that in the cabinet, he often used James while still making James believe he was working for James's benefit.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:08] Balbec | I thought James was quite childish, so I readily believed it.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:13] Balbec | I realized that Albertine was more likable than she herself had hoped, and she didn't need to boast about her success in love.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:18] Balbec | I knew that she always kept silent about the scene that had taken place by her bed between Steven and herself.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:38] Balbec | I thought that if I were a hunchback, the whole world would surely know.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:43] Balbec | I thought about her attitude in this scene, and Steven remained utterly puzzled.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:48] Balbec | I thought about the assumption of her absolute chastity (Albertine had so brutally refused to let Steven kiss her, refused to let Steven have her body, and Steven first attributed this to that assumption. But in terms of Steven's own view of his girlfriend as kind and basically honest, such absolute chastity was by no means essential), and Steven had to repeatedly speculate on it many times.\n[1897-10-13 08:33:53] Balbec | I thought of this hypothesis, which was so utterly opposite to the one Steven had made on the first day he met Albertine!\n[1897-10-13 08:33:58] Balbec | I thought then, in order to escape Steven, she rang the bell, this rough action surrounded by so many other actions that were entirely different from it, all of which were far more passionate toward Steven (soothing, sometimes anxious, watchful, jealous of Steven's preference for Andre, etc.).\n[1897-10-13 08:34:03] Balbec | I wondered why she had sent Steven to spend the evening by her bedside, and why she had always used tender words.\n[1897-10-13 08:34:08] Balbec | I thought of wanting to see a boyfriend, worried that he might prefer your girlfriend over you, tried to please him, romantically telling him that no one would know that he spent the evening with you, yet you refused to give him such a simple happiness.\n[1897-10-13 08:34:13] Balbec | I thought, if this is not a pleasure for you, then what is the basis of all these desires?\n[1897-10-13 08:34:18] Balbec | I thought that no matter what, Steven would never believe that Albertine's chastity had reached such a degree.\n[1897-10-13 08:34:23] Balbec | I thought, so Steven once again wondered whether there was some coquettish reason behind her brusqueness, for instance, perhaps she felt she had an unpleasant smell that she feared Steven wouldn't like; or may be it was timidity, such as her complete ignorance of the real nature of love, believing that Steven's nervous exhaustion could be transmitted through a kiss?\n[1897-10-13 08:34:28] Balbec | I saw that she was surely regretting that she hadn't made Steven happy, so I gave Steven a gilded pencil.\n[1897-10-13 08:34:38] Balbec | I thought of people who were moved by your enthusiasm but refused to give you what you wanted, yet agreed to do other things for you—for example, critics who should have written articles praising novelists, but instead invited them to dinner in the square; Edward didn't personally take the young dandies to the theater, but only sent them when she wasn't occupying the private box herself!\n[1897-10-13 08:34:43] Balbec | I thought of those people who do the least and can do nothing at all, yet are carefully and cautiously pushed into doing something! Albertine giving Steven a gold-leaf pen was an abnormal expression of this virtue-driven mentality!\n[1897-10-13 08:34:48] Balbec | I heard Steven tell her that she had given Steven this pencil, which made Steven happy.\n[1897-10-13 08:34:53] Balbec | I thought of the night when she came to the hotel with him, but compared to the joy Steven would have felt if she had allowed him to kiss her, this happiness was greatly diminished.\n[1897-10-13 08:34:58] Balbec | I heard, \"That would make Steven so happy! What harm would it do you? You rejected Steven, Steven is really strange.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:03] Balbec | \"I was the one who surprised Steven,\" she replied to Steven, \"it's you who should be surprised that this seems strange to you. I don't know what kind of girls you've seen in the past, for Steven's behavior to seem strange to you.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:08] Balbec | I heard \"I'm sorry, Steven felt deeply guilty, but even now, Steven couldn't tell you that Steven thought he was wrong.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:13] Balbec | I heard \"Steven's view was that these things were unimportant, Steven didn't understand, how a girl who could easily make someone happy refused to do so.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:18] Balbec | \"I heard 'We've made a deal,' \" Steven added again, \"Steven didn't mean that a girl can do anything, that there's no such thing as immoral behavior.\" I thought of it as a way to satisfy half of her moral convictions, while also recalling how she and her girlfriends used to beat up the girlfriend of the actress Léa.\n[1897-10-13 08:35:23] Balbec | \"I heard 'You listen, one day when you talk to Steven about a young girl who lived in Riverside and her relationship with an actress, Steven thinks it's so shameful, so shameful, that he believes the girl's rival made it up, that it didn't really happen at all.'\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:28] Balbec | \"I heard 'Steven thinks it's unlikely, impossible, but if a boyfriend embraces her, even more so, since you say Steven is your friend...\"",

    "text": "[1897-10-13 08:35:33] Balbec | I heard him say, \"You're Steven's friend, but before you, Steven had other friends too. Steven has met some young men, and Steven assures you that they had the same friendship for Steven.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:38] Balbec | I heard, \"But no one dared to do it; they knew that if they did, they'd get two slaps on the head.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:43] Balbec | \"I heard, 'Besides, they probably didn't even think that way. Everyone just straightforwardly, kindly, as good partners, shook hands.'\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:48] Balbec | I heard him say, \"No one has ever spoken of hugging, yet it did not lessen their friendship.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:53] Balbec | I heard, \"Well, if you value Steven's friendship, you'll be satisfied. Steven must really like you to forgive you.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:35:58] Balbec | I heard, \"But Steven is certain that you don't really care about Steven. Admit it, what pleases you is André.\"\n[1897-10-13 08:36:03] Balbec | I heard, \"After all, you're right, she's much more passionate than Steven, and she's so enchanting! Ah, men!\"\n[1897-10-13 08:36:08] Balbec | I thought that although Steven was very disappointed lately, Albertine's frank words had actually made Steven respect her greatly, leaving him with a very favorable impression of her.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:13] Balbec | I thought that this impression might have had a great and harmful effect on Steven afterward, because from this impression there arose that almost affectionate feeling, that moral core, which persisted throughout Steven's love for Albertine.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:18] Balbec | I thought that such an emotion could become the source of the greatest pain, because to truly suffer torment for a woman, one must first have complete trust in her.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:23] Balbec | I thought that, at this moment, thisprototype of morality, respect, and friendship still remained in Steven's heart like a stone.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:28] Balbec | I thought that if it were to remain like this, no longer growing, like the following year, or even like the last few weeks when Steven first stayed in Riverside, maintaining its lifeless state, this one factor would not at all interfere with Steven's happiness.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:33] Balbec | I thought that some guests, in any case, it would be more prudent to get rid of them, but people leave them where they are, not bothering them. Their weakness is feeling lonely in a stranger's mind, which has already made them temporarily harmless.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:38] Balbec | I thought that this kind of emotion in Steven's heart was like a guest such as this.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:43] Balbec | I thought that now, Steven's dream could once again freely settle on one or another of Albertine's girlfriends, starting with André.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:48] Balbec | I wondered whether Andre's enthusiasm for Steven would be known to Albertine, and if Steven was not certain about it, her enthusiasm might not have moved Steven so much.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:53] Balbec | I thought, of course, that for a long time Steven had pretended to prefer Andre, his habit of conversation, his habit of expressing tenderness, which provided Steven with material for his ready-made love for her.\n[1897-10-13 08:36:58] Balbec | I thought that up to now, only one thing was missing—that is, a touch of genuine feeling. Now Steven's heart was free again, able to offer that genuine feeling.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:03] Balbec | I thought, but Andre had too much intelligence, was overly sensitive and excessively sickly, too much like Steven, and Steven would not love her.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:08] Balbec | I thought that if Steven now found Albertine strangely empty, Andre would be filled with something too familiar to Steven.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:13] Balbec | I thought back to the first day, on the sea wall, when Steven had originally believed he was seeing the mistress of a bicycle rider, lost in his passion for sports.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:18] Balbec | I thought that André had told Steven that she had taken up the sport on the doctor's advice, in order to treat her neurasthenia and nutritional disorders, and that her finest hours were spent translating a novel by George Eliot.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:23] Balbec | I realized that Steven had been completely wrong about what kind of person André was from the very beginning, and as a result, Steven was deeply disappointed—but in fact, this disappointment meant nothing to Steven.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:28] Balbec | I thought of this kind of mistake: although such mistakes can still allow love to exist, they are only acknowledged when love can no longer change, and thus become one of the sources of suffering.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:33] Balbec | I thought of this kind of mistake—which could be very different from, even the opposite of, the one Steven had made regarding André, especially in André's case, where it was often due to placing too much importance on appearances, on gestures that seemed to be so, but actually were not, leading to a fantasy at first contact.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:38] Balbec | I thought that, whether good or bad, besides their appearance, pretense, imitation, and desire to be admired, they also had to add the illusion of conversation and manner.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:43] Balbec | I thought of some shameless, cruel people who were no more able to withstand this test than certain kind-hearted, loyal people.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:48] Balbec | I thought, similarly, that people often discover someone known for their charity is actually a vain and stingy person, while a girl who seems honest and conventional turns out to be something like Messalina.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:53] Balbec | I thought Steven had believed André to be a healthy and simple girl, but in reality, she was only someone seeking health.\n[1897-10-13 08:37:58] Balbec | I thought that André believed many people were healthy, but that wasn't true, just as a fat, coarse-featured man with a red face wearing a white flannel shirt wasn't necessarily a strongman.\n[1897-10-13 08:38:03] Balbec | I thought of loving someone because of the health he displayed, when in fact he was merely a sick person, one who only gains health from others, just like certain planets borrow light from other luminous bodies, or like certain objects that only allow electric current to pass through them.\n[1897-10-13 08:38:08] Balbec | I thought that in some cases, this situation was not unimportant to happiness.\n[1897-10-13 08:38:13] Balbec Seaside | I knew that, like Unknown_Rosemonde and Héloïse, André was indeed Albertine's boyfriend, even more so than Unknown_Rosemonde and Héloïse. I thought that Steven considered all of this unimportant.\n[1897-10-14 13:58:30] Balbec Seaside | I knew she shared her life with Albertine, imitated her mannerisms, so that at the very beginning, Steven could not tell which one was which.\n[1897-10-14 13:58:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought that in Steven's eyes, these girls were bunches of roses, their main charm lying in their scattering across the sea, and they still maintained that inseparability that existed between them before Steven had met them.\n[1897-10-14 13:58:55] Balbec Seaside | I knew that at that time, whichever of them appeared would have excited Steven so much that she would have announced to Steven that the small group was not far away.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:15] Balbec Seaside | I saw the one who was watching. I thought of it even now, and that made Steven happy.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:20] Balbec Seaside | I thought that this happiness contained a component of the pleasure of seeing others appear with her or join her a little later.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:25] Balbec Seaside | I thought that even if others didn't come that day, there would still be the pleasure of talking about them, knowing that others would tell them how happy Steven was on the sea wall.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:30] Balbec Seaside | I couldn't tell just how much of it was actually due to that factor, Steven said.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:35] Balbec Seaside | I realized that this was no longer simply the attraction of a newcomer, but rather true infidelity in love, wavering between each of them, obviously each one could replace the other.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought of Steven's greatest sorrow, not that the girl Steven loved most abandoned him, but that Steven was unable to immediately like any one of them.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought that if it were possible, Steven could concentrate all the sorrow and fantasy that vaguely drifted around everyone onto just one person—the one who would eventually abandon Steven.\n[1897-10-14 13:59:50] Balbec Seaside | I wondered whether, in the eyes of all her other girlfriends, Steven would immediately lose all his authority, and whether Steven might unconsciously grow fond of all her other girlfriends, since before that, Steven had felt a collective kind of love for them?\n[1897-10-14 13:59:55] Balbec Seaside | I thought of politicians or actors, who also experience this collective love from the public; after receiving the public's affection, they cannot feel at ease if they are cast aside.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:00] Balbec Seaside | I knew that Steven had not won Albertine's favor. I thought that now, whenever a girl left Steven at night, saying something ambiguous to him and casting him a look whose meaning was unclear, Steven would suddenly hope to receive this favor from that girl.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:05] Balbec Seaside | I thought that with just a sentence, just a glance, Steven's impulse would revolve around her all day.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:10] Balbec Seaside | I saw on their lively and agile faces the outlines just beginning to take shape, enough to allow the recognition of a malleable, elusive figure.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:25] Balbec Seaside | I thought that even if things were to change again, this impulse would be all the more sensual as it drifted between them.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought that although these girls' faces were so different from one another, they might perhaps be superimposed on one another, and the differences in length and width of their faces were far less than the differences between their features.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought that the way Steven and others perceive a face is non-mathematical. First of all, this perception does not begin with measuring each part, but rather starts with an expression, a general impression.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:40] Balbec Seaside | I saw, for example, Andre's face: Steven saw the gentle eyes and delicate lines that seemed to connect with a small nose, narrow and thin, like a simple curve drawn on paper.\n[1897-10-14 14:00:55] Balbec Seaside | I thought that it was meant to allow the noble idea of the smile in her eyes to continue along a single line.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:00] Balbec Seaside | I saw the same delicate line drawn in her hair, light and deep, like the track of a breeze plowing through sand.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:15] Balbec Seaside | I saw here a bulge forming, there a depression, like the snow rising or sinking with the contours of the land. I knew that, in this respect, she was probably influenced by heredity, since Andre's hair, like Robert's, was entirely styled in the same way.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought of nature, and compared to the delicate line of Andre's nose, Unknown_Rosemonde's nose seemed to offer a broad plane, like a tall tower rising from a wide base.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought of how an immeasurably fine line could create a great difference, and the facial expression alone was enough to make one believe how vast that difference was.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought that an immeasurably fine line itself could form a completely distinctive expression, a person's personality.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought that what made these faces distinct from one another was not merely the infinitely small details and characteristics of their expressions.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought that between the faces of Steven's girlfriends, the complexion created a more profound distinction, but the reason was not that the complexion provided a richly varied beauty to the faces.\n[1897-10-14 14:01:55] Balbec Seaside | I saw Steven seeing Unknown_Rosemonde immersed in a rose-colored glow dusted with lycopodium, and the greenish gleam in her eyes once again took effect on that rose color.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:10] Balbec Seaside | I saw how Steven found such dignity and nobility in the whiteness of Andre's cheeks, which stood out so beautifully from her jet-black hair.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:25] Balbec Seaside | I thought of how different their skin tones were, so that Steven's experience of standing before Unknown_Rosemonde was the same as when he stood before André, just as one feels the same pleasure in gazing successively at a hydrangea growing by the sunlit shore and a camellia in the hazy night.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought about how skin color creates more profound distinctions, mainly because, through this new factor of color, the immeasurably small differences between lines are immensely magnified, and the proportions of the plane are completely transformed.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought of this new factor as a great generator, or at least, a proportion changer, just like the color mixer.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought that the result would be a face with relatively little difference, which, depending on whether it was illuminated by the red of fiery hair, the pinkness of fair skin, or the dull pale light, might appear longer or broader, becoming another face.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought of it like the props in a Russian ballet; if seen during the day, sometimes it was just a simple round piece of paper.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought of talents like Baxter, who could envelop a set in a pinkish or moonlit glow, inlay the front of a palace with lapis lazuli, or make the Bengal roses in a garden bloom softly.\n[1897-10-14 14:02:55] Balbec Seaside | I thought of how the Stevenes also recognized faces in this way, how the Stevenes carefully assessed faces as painters, not as land surveyors.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:00] Balbec Seaside | I thought of Albertine and her girlfriends, and it was the same in every case.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:05] Balbec Seaside | I saw certain days when Steven saw her as slender, pale, and melancholy.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:20] Balbec Seaside | I saw her eyes, deep within the purple, translucent light, like the color of the sea at times. I thought of how she seemed to be suffering from the sorrow of a exile.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:25] Balbec Seaside | I saw other days, in which Steven saw her face more smooth, with a glazed surface that clung to desire, yet kept that desire from going further.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:40] Balbec Seaside | I saw that unless Steven suddenly looked at her from the side. I saw her cheeks, which lacked luster, like a white wax candle, their surface appearing pinkish because of their translucence.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought how lovely it would be to kiss those cheeks, to touch that different skin which no one else can see.\n[1897-10-14 14:03:55] Balbec Seaside | Sometimes I saw her, and happiness would bathe her cheeks in such trembling brightness that her skin became fluid and blurred.\n[1897-10-14 14:04:10] Balbec Seaside | I saw what seemed to be a ray of sunlight slipping through, giving the skin a different color than the eyes, rather than a different texture.\n[1897-10-14 14:04:25] Balbec Seaside | I sometimes saw, entirely unexpected to Steven, Steven gazing at her face, dotted with brown speckles, and only two places where the blue marks seemed more pronounced.\n[1897-10-14 14:04:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought it seemed to be made from the egg of a goldfinch, and often looked as if it were made from milky white agate that had been worked and polished in only two places.",

    "text": "[1897-10-14 14:04:45] Balbec Seaside | I saw her eyes shining within the brown gem, like the translucent wings of a sky-blue butterfly.\n[1897-10-14 14:05:00] Balbec Seaside | I saw muscles become a clear mirror. I thought that this made Steven imagine a fantasy in which the body's other parts were less able to bring Steven's mind closer than this one.\n[1897-10-14 14:05:05] Balbec Seaside | I saw the more common situation, when her face was more vivid, and thus more full of life; sometimes on her pale face, only the tip of her nose was pink.\n[1897-10-14 14:05:20] Balbec Seaside | I saw her nose was delicate, like the nose of a sly little cat. I thought how much I wanted to play with that little cat for a while.\n[1897-10-14 14:05:25] Balbec Seaside | I sometimes saw her cheeks so smooth that my gaze would slide down over the rosy enamel, just as it would flow over a small, delicate porcelain teacup with its rosy enamel.\n[1897-10-14 14:05:40] Balbec Seaside | I saw her jet-black hair forming a half-open, multi-layered lid, making the pink enamel even more elegant and inward-looking.\n[1897-10-14 14:05:55] Balbec Seaside | I sometimes saw her cheeks reach the pinkish-purple hue of an cyclamen flower.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:10] Balbec Seaside | I sometimes saw her with a flushed face or feverish, which made me think she had a frail constitution.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:25] Balbec Seaside | I saw that her face had taken on a deep purple hue, like the dark red of certain roses that are almost black. I thought this made Steven's desire subside, turning it into something more sensual, and also made her gaze express something more evil, more unhealthy.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought of these various Albertines, each different, like a female dancer whose colors, figure, and character constantly changed with the ever-changing stage lights, each appearance unique.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought that perhaps it was precisely because the person Steven had admired in her during that period was so changeable, that later Steven developed a habit of becoming another person depending on which Albertine he was thinking of.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought of Steven, either burning with jealousy, or utterly indifferent, or pursuing sensual pleasure, or melancholy, or in a rage.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought that it was not merely a matter of these figures returning with the revival of memory, but rather that they were being re-created according to the strength of belief imposed by the different ways Steven understood the same memory.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought I should keep talking about this, about these beliefs.\n[1897-10-14 14:06:55] Balbec Seaside | I realized that, most of the time, these beliefs quietly filled the minds of Stevenes, and for their happiness, they were more important than any person they actually saw.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:00] Balbec Seaside | I thought that because the Stevenes saw him through these beliefs, it was these beliefs that gave the person being looked at his fleeting size.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:05] Balbec Seaside | I thought that, in order to be more accurate, Steven would probably have to give a different name to every future Steven who thought of Albertine, and even more so, a different name to every Albertine who appeared before Steven.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:10] Balbec Seaside | I thought of Albertine appearing before Steven, never in the same form, just like the various different seas that keep coming one after another.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:15] Balbec Seaside | I thought that for the sake of convenience, Steven simply called it the sea, and Albertine was another sea nymph, whose figure became more clearly defined in the sea.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:20] Balbec Seaside | I thought of something even more extreme—done in the same way, and supposedly even more beneficial—in a narrative, to mention what the weather was like on that day—Steven should have always left the name \"weather\" to belief.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:25] Balbec Seaside | I thought of the day Steven saw Albertine, and the kind of belief that enveloped Steven's mind, forming the atmosphere of that day.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought about the human face, how it is as varied as the surface of the sea, and that all these differences depend on the almost invisible clouds.\n[1897-10-14 14:07:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought of these cloud formations, their concentrated forms, their flowing forms, their scattering forms, their fleeing forms, and how they altered the color of everything.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:10] Balbec Seaside | I know that just like one evening when George stopped to speak with those girls but didn't introduce Steven to them, he tore a hole in the clouds, and as the girls walked away, their images suddenly seemed more beautiful to Steven.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:15] Balbec Seaside | I knew that after a few days, Steven became acquainted with them, and the cloud mass formed again, obscuring their brilliance, often stretching between them and Steven's eyes. I thought of this cloud mass as opaque and gentle, like Leucothea in Virgil's work.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:20] Balbec Seaside | I thought that since those girls' words, in some way, had indicated to Steven the method by which he should look at their expressions, the meaning of each of their faces had undoubtedly changed a great deal for Steven.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:25] Balbec Seaside | I saw Steven using questions to provoke their conversation according to his own will, making their words take on countless forms, like a person conducting an experiment and proving his hypothesis through refutation.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought that Steven could give these words a higher value.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought that bringing the people and events that appear beautiful and mysterious from a distance up close would be enough to make Steven realize that they possessed neither mystery nor beauty.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought that, in general, this was a way of solving the problems of life, and among many possible ways, it was also a healthy method to choose.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought this method might not be worth recommending specifically, but it would grant Steven some sort of calm to get by, to endure death.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought this method would make the Stevenes leave without a second thought, convincing them that they had already encountered the most outstanding people and events, which in reality were nothing special at all.\n[1897-10-15 14:57:55] Balbec Seaside | I thought that Steven had originally believed that, deep in the minds of these girls, there was a contempt for chastity, and that they lived on the memory of fleeting romantic affairs by means of this contempt.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:00] Balbec Seaside | I thought that now, Steven believed that a sense of integrity was at work in their minds.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:05] Balbec Seaside | I thought these principles might still waver, but so far they had prevented the girls who had accepted them from their bourgeois class from straying onto any wrong path.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:10] Balbec Seaside | I thought of someone who, from the very beginning, goes astray, even in small matters.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:15] Balbec Seaside | I thought about how, when mistaken assumptions or faulty memories lead you to search in the wrong direction for the source of a rumor or the place where something was lost, such situations might occur: you discover an error, but instead of replacing it with the truth, you simply substitute it with another error.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:20] Balbec Seaside | I saw Steven talking warmly with them. I saw that Steven indeed found the word \"innocent\" reflected on their faces, and in terms of the way these young women lived and behaved, Steven truly experienced the full meaning of the word.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:25] Balbec Seaside | I know that just as Steven had never seen Arthur in a matinée, the name Jules Ferry did not appear on the program for that performance, and yet this did not prevent Steven from telling Paul that Jules Ferry had probably written the introductory piece for the show. I thought, perhaps Steven had observed carelessly and interpreted too hastily, mistakenly, because the word wasn't actually written on their faces.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought that in the memories of Stevens about a person, anything that wasn't immediately useful to their daily relationships was automatically excluded by the mind (and especially if these relationships had even a touch of love, love that had never been fulfilled and still lived on in the near future).\n[1897-10-15 14:58:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought that for any of the girls in this small group, the last face Steven saw could not possibly be the only face in Steven's memory.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought of the mind, which allows the chain of past events to pass through it, yet clings desperately to the last link of the chain.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought of the metal that had been forged into this piece, which was completely different from the various links in the journeys of Steven and others that vanished into the night.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:50] Balbec Seaside | I thought of Steven's mind, which regarded only the country where Steven was at that moment as the real country.\n[1897-10-15 14:58:55] Balbec Seaside | I thought of Steven's initial impression, which had already become so distant, that in Steven's memory there was no evidence to prevent it from changing every day.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:00] Balbec Seaside | I saw the long hours that Steven spent chatting, having tea, and playing with this girl. I thought how Steven didn't remember that the same women, who had once marched in front of the sea like figures on a mural, cold and sensuous, were the very ones he had known before.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:05] Balbec Seaside | I thought that geographers and archaeologists would take Stevenes to the island of Calypso, would excavate the palace of Minos, but Calypso was only a woman, and Minos only a king without any divine aura.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:10] Balbec Seaside | I thought that even history, which tells of the real characteristics of people like Steven, often differs greatly from the virtues and flaws that Steven himself attributes to imaginary characters bearing the same names.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:15] Balbec Seaside | I thought of the beautiful sea myth that Steven had created during his first days here, and it had vanished like that.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:20] Balbec Seaside | I thought that, at least, the Stevenes had spent some time in an atmosphere of unbridled informality that they had once considered unattainable and passionately longed for, and this was not something to be taken lightly.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:25] Balbec Seaside | I thought of those Stevenes who at first seemed awkward, and even when, in the end, one finally experienced an unnatural, affected kind of happiness beside them, that happiness always carried the taint of their concealed flaws.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:30] Balbec Seaside | I thought of the true pleasure that lay at the root of Steven's relationship with Albertine and her girlfriend, which left behind a fragrant trace.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:35] Balbec Seaside | I thought of that fragrance, which no artificial method could give to a fruit plucked before its time, or to grapes that had never ripened in the sun.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:40] Balbec Seaside | I thought that for a while, they were fairies to Steven.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:45] Balbec Seaside | I thought that even without Steven's awareness, they had introduced some magical elements into the most ordinary relationships between Steven and them, or rather, they prevented any mundane elements from entering these relationships.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:50] Balbec Seaside | I saw Steven's desire greedily seeking the meaning behind the eyes. I thought that these eyes now understood Steven and were smiling at him, but on the first day, when these eyes met Steven's, they seemed like a light from another universe.\n[1897-10-15 14:59:55] Balbec Seaside | I saw Steven's desire spreading in a vast and meticulous way the colors and scents over the flesh-and-blood surfaces of these girls. I thought of them lying on the cliff, simple-mindedly passing a sandwich to Steven or playing a game of riddles.\n[1897-10-15 15:00:00] Balbec Seaside | I would spend entire afternoons watching, as Steven lay there, surrounded by beautiful bodies with brown and golden hair, scattered all around him. I saw it like those painters who seek the grandeur of antiquity in modern life, endowing a woman cutting her toe nails with the nobility of \"The Curer of the Wound,\" or, like Rubens, painting some women they knew as goddesses to form scenes from ancient mythology.\n[1897-10-15 20:42:52] Balbec Seaside | I saw Steven looking at those beautiful bodies. I thought perhaps they had not removed all the banal inner qualities, and daily experiences filled them with banal inner qualities.\n[1897-10-15 20:42:57] Balbec Seaside | I thought, but (Steven had not recalled their divine origins) Steven, however, seemed to be playing among the fairies like Hercules or Telemachus.",

    "text": "[1897-10-16 06:57:59] The Grand Hotel de Balbec | I knew that after that, the concert ended, the bad weather came, Steven's girlfriends left Riverside, not all of them left together like swallows, but each one left within a week.\n[1897-10-16 06:58:19] The Balbec Hotel | I knew that Albertine had left first, suddenly, and none of her girlfriends, neither at the time nor afterwards, ever understood why she had suddenly gone back to Willowbrook, neither because of schoolwork nor because of any leisure activity that called her to Willowbrook.\n[1897-10-16 06:58:39] The Grand Hotel Balbec | \"I heard her leave without saying a word,\" Françoise muttered. I thought that perhaps she actually wanted the Stevenes to behave that way.\n[1897-10-16 06:58:44] The Grand Hotel Balbec | I knew the number of employees had greatly decreased, but there were still a few customers left here, and some employees remained. The manager, meanwhile, \"embezzled the money.\" I thought about how she found Steven and the other employees too careless in front of the staff and the manager.\n[1897-10-16 06:58:49] Hotel Balbec | I knew for sure that the hotel was about to close, and almost everyone had already left. I thought that the hotel had never been so comfortable, of course the manager didn't think so.\n[1897-10-16 06:58:54] Balbec Hotel | I saw the manager pacing back and forth along the halls in the corridor. I saw that in the drawing room, people were shivering from the cold, and there was no longer a servant at the entrance of the drawing room.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:04] The Grand Hotel Balbec | I saw him in a brand-new suit, his hair perfectly groomed, and his dull, uninteresting face seemed to be a mixture, with perhaps three parts makeup for every one part of flesh.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:19] Balbec Hotel | I saw him changing his tie again and again. I thought that this kind of ostentation was more like a person who could no longer afford to give a thousand francs for a good deed, but still had no trouble appearing generous by giving a hundred sous as a tip to the telegraph boy.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:24] Balbec Hotel | I thought of him as if he were inspecting nothingness, as though trying to give this desolate scene a temporary quality by means of his well-kept appearance.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:29] Balbec Hotel | I thought that in this already poor-quality hotel, people were deeply affected by this bleak scene.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:34] Balbec Hotel | I thought of the manager as a ghost, a reenactment of a monarch, haunting the ruins of his former palace.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:39] Balbec Hotel | I knew that this local railway had ceased to run because of the lack of passengers, and would resume only in the following spring. I thought the manager was especially upset about it.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:44] The Balbec Hotel | \"I know what's missing here is means of transportation,\" he often said.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:49] Balbec Hotel | I knew that, despite the deficit, he still made grand plans for the coming years. I thought that, no matter what, when beautiful words are applied to the hotel industry and can make it appear magnificent and grand, he could still accurately remember some of them.\n[1897-10-16 06:59:54] The Grand Hotel at Balbec | I heard him say, \"Although Steven has an excellent team in the dining room, his staff is still insufficient. The uniformed servants still need improvement. You'll see what outstanding troops Steven will gather next year!\"\n[1897-10-16 06:59:59] The Grand Hotel at Balbec | I saw Steven often ask to get on the carriage and sit next to the driver, so that no matter what the weather, Steven could go out for a walk, just like he had during that winter in Sunrise. I knew that the postal service in Riverside had been suspended, which forced him to send someone to pick up the letters, and sometimes he used a clumsy carriage to transport passengers.\n[1897-10-16 07:00:00] New Residence | I saw the dawn, and Steven heard the chirping of the birds. I thought that Steven found these cries uninteresting when heard by Françoise.\n[1897-10-16 07:00:05] New Residence | I saw Steven say a word to the \"maids\" here. I thought that Steven would be surprised to find out about it.\n[1897-10-16 07:00:10] New Residence | I saw that even just walking a little was something. I thought that Steven's awareness of this would disturb her and make her wonder who was moving around, since the Stevenes had moved.\n[1897-10-17 11:26:29] New Residence | I know that, in the old apartment on the seventh floor where the Stevenes lived, the sound of servants moving around was not exactly quiet.\n[1897-10-17 11:26:49] New Residence | I thought that Steven knew she was familiar with them, and she felt very comfortable hearing their footsteps moving around.\n[1897-10-17 11:26:54] New Residence | I saw that, even in the silence. I thought that Steven also felt that she would find it unbearable.\n[1897-10-18 15:52:59] New Residence | I saw that the area where Steven's new home was located was very quiet. I knew that Steven's old home had windows facing a bustling tree-lined avenue.\n[1897-10-18 15:53:14] New Residence | I saw Steven, and he felt that whenever a passerby sang, even if the voice was very faint and heard from far away, it sounded as clear as a theme from an orchestral piece.\n[1897-10-18 15:53:29] New Residence | I saw the moved-out Françoise hearing these sounds. I thought that Steven would also shed tears upon seeing her.\n[1897-10-18 15:53:34] New Residence | I knew that although Steven had mocked her for being distressed inside about having to leave a house that was \"full of respect.\" I thought of Steven recalling the previous mockery.\n[1897-10-19 20:19:33] New Residence | I knew, according to the custom in Sunrise, she would weep and wail while packing her things, insisting that nowhere else would she find a house better than Steven's old home.\n[1897-10-19 20:19:53] New Residence | I saw, but Steven saw that the family's old maid was almost disheartened because the concierge, on their first meeting, had not shown her sufficient respect. I thought that because Steven knew that respect was an essential spiritual nourishment for her.\n[1897-10-21 00:45:58] New Residence | I saw that Steven then went over to her.\n[1897-10-21 00:46:08] New Residence | I thought of Steven, who, although he did not linger over old things, also found it difficult to adapt to new surroundings.\n[1897-10-21 00:46:13] New Residence | I thought that Steven believed only she could understand Steven.\n[1897-10-21 00:46:18] New Residence | I thought of nature, and the young servant who was thinking of her would never understand Steven's feelings.\n[1897-10-22 14:41:17] New Residence | I knew he was hardly yet considered a resident of Sunrise.\n[1897-10-22 14:41:37] New Residence | I thought of Steven watching the moving process, moving into a new district, which for him was like a vacation.\n[1897-10-22 14:41:42] New Residence | I thought of how the new things that Steven experienced made him happy, like having gone on a trip; he thought he had arrived in the countryside.\n[1897-10-22 14:41:47] New Residence | I knew he had caught a cold. I thought of Steven, who felt as though a \"draft\" had blown into the compartment through an open window, giving him a strange sense of worldly experience.\n[1897-10-22 14:41:52] New Residence | I saw him sneeze every time. I thought of Steven, who was delighted that he had found such a satisfactory job, because he had long hoped to encounter an employer who traveled frequently.\n[1897-10-23 19:07:57] New Residence | I saw that, so Steven didn't go looking for him, but went straight to Françoise instead.\n[1897-10-24 23:34:17] New Residence | I knew Steven had been indifferent to moving, even mocking her when she became sad and cried. I thought Steven was feeling a bit regretful.\n[1897-10-24 23:34:22] New Residence | I saw that, so when she saw Steven looking troubled, she deliberately acted cold and distant. I thought, and besides, Steven knew that she was just as dull and melancholic as Steven.\n[1897-10-24 23:34:27] New Residence | I thought that Steven believed that people with nervousness became more \"sensitive,\" and thus more selfish.\n[1897-10-24 23:34:32] New Residence | I thought of Steven, who realized that they allowed themselves to suffer, but would not let anyone show the slightest sign of unhappiness in their presence.\n[1897-10-24 23:34:37] New Residence | I thought of Steven, who would carefully savor every bit of pain Françoise felt for her, even the slightest.\n[1897-10-24 23:34:42] New Residence | I saw that if Steven was unhappy, she would deliberately turn her head away. I thought of it in order to make Steven's suffering uncompassionate, even unnoticed.",

    "text": "[1897-10-26 22:58:31] New Residence | I saw Steven about to speak to her about their new home, and she turned her head away.\n[1897-10-26 22:58:36] New Residence | Two days later, I saw that Françoise had to return to the house where Steven and his family had just moved out to fetch a few clothes she had left behind. I thought about how Steven had seen the woman's fickle nature.\n[1897-10-26 22:58:46] New Residence | I heard that upon returning, she actually said that she had almost suffocated on the street where Steven's family used to live, and that she really felt \"out of place\" returning to the old house.\n[1897-10-26 22:58:51] New Residence | I heard her say she had never seen such an inconvenient staircase.\n[1897-10-26 22:58:56] New Residence | I heard her say that she wouldn't go back there even if she could become queen, not even for millions of dollars. I thought to myself, Steven was just talking nonsense anyway, and it wouldn't cost her anything!\n[1897-10-26 22:59:01] New Residence | I heard her say that Steven's new home was decorated infinitely better than the old one. I thought that Steven saw nothing in it but the kitchen and the corridor.\n[1897-10-26 22:59:06] New Residence | I knew that by then, Steven's \"fever\" had not yet subsided after the move. I thought of Steven like a python that had just swallowed a whole cow, feeling myself painfully stretched and deformed by a box, so swollen that even looking at Steven would be unbearable.\n[1897-10-26 22:59:11] New Residence | I knew that Steven's new home was an apartment in one of theannex buildings of Fairhaven. I was thinking, but here, Steven should make a clarification.\n[1897-10-28 00:23:14] New Residence | I saw that the Stevenes avoided talking about her. I knew that the Stevenes had moved here because Steven's grandmother was in poor health and needed cleaner air, and that was the reason.\n[1897-10-29 02:55:38] Hall of Thought | I thought that Steven believed that Steven had given the unknowable a name, thereby providing an image of the unknowable for Stevenes.\n[1897-10-29 02:55:43] Hall of Thought | I thought that Steven also believed that names pointed to a specific entity, forcing Steven to unify the name with the entity.\n[1897-10-29 02:55:48] Hall of Thought | I saw that even Steven could set out for a city to find a soul that the city could not contain. I thought that Steven and others no longer had the right to deprive their names of their soul.\n[1897-10-29 02:55:53] Hall of Thought | I thought of Steven, who felt that in such an era, names gave cities and rivers a personality just like symbolic paintings did.\n[1897-10-29 02:55:58] Hall of Thought | I thought not only did it make the material world colorful and magnificent, but also made human society appear in a strange and bizarre manner.\n[1897-10-29 02:56:03] Hall of Thought | I thought of Steven, imagining that every castle, manor, or palace had its mistress or fairy, just as forests have forest spirits and waters have water spirits.\n[1897-10-29 02:56:08] Hall of Thought | I thought that sometimes Steven believed fairies were deeply hidden behind their names, nourished by the imaginations of the Stevenes, and changing along with their imaginations.\n[1897-10-29 02:56:13] Hall of Thought | I saw that, despite the years, Edward to Steven was nothing more than an image on a slide or a stained-glass window.\n[1897-10-30 16:05:32] Hall of Thought | I saw Steven's dream, which had been drenched by the foaming torrents of an entirely different vision, begin to lose its sheen.\n[1897-10-30 16:05:47] Hall of Thought | I thought, but Steven realized that as soon as the Steven approached the real person indicated by the name, the fairy would disappear.\n[1897-10-30 16:05:52] Hall of Thought | I thought that once a person's name is united with her, she is no longer a fairy.\n[1897-10-30 16:05:57] Hall of Thought | I thought of Steven, and how if the Stevenes left her, the fairy would reappear.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:02] Hall of Thought | I thought, but as long as the Stevenes stayed by her side and didn't leave, she would eventually disappear, and with her, even her name would vanish.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:07] Hall of Thought | I know that, for example, the family of Lusignan would also lose its luster on the day the fairy Melusine departed. I thought of Steven, thinking just like the Lusignan family.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:12] Hall of Thought | I thought that Steven considered names to be nothing more than an ordinary ID card with a photo.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:17] Hall of Thought | I saw that when someone approached, the Stevenes would look at this ID card. I thought of finding out whether the Stevenes knew this passerby and whether they should greet him.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:22] Hall of Thought | I thought of Steven, whose name had been transformed again and again through the imaginations of the Stevenes.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:27] Hall of Thought | I thought, but Steven could still recognize the original image of a woman whom the Stevenes had never met.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:32] Hall of Thought | I thought of it, but even though a certain feeling produced in some past year would, like an automatic recorder that preserves the voices and styles of different artists, bring back this name to the memories of Stevenes.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:37] Hall of Thought | I thought of making the Stevenes hear this name again, and have it sound just as it once did, with no change on the surface.\n[1897-10-30 16:06:42] The Hall of Thought | I thought that the Stevenes still could feel it, but the series of dreams that same sound had once stirred in the Stevenes were no longer the same.\n[1897-11-02 18:25:05] New Residence | I knew that Françoise's friend spent very little time at home; he had obtained a position in a certain ministry, where he worked as an employee.\n[1897-11-02 18:25:25] New Residence | I knew that the tailor who made the vests had initially lived with a \"mischievous girl,\" and Steven's grandmother had once mistakenly thought they were mother and daughter.\n[1897-11-02 18:25:45] New Residence | I knew that a few years ago, Steven's grandmother had visited Charles, when the girl was still very young, but her dress had already been made quite nicely.\n[1897-11-02 18:26:05] New Residence | I knew that when she switched to making women's clothing, becoming a dressmaker, it would no longer be profitable for Mark to continue his old trade.\n[1897-11-02 18:26:25] New Residence | I know she first worked as an apprentice in a women's clothing tailor shop, hemming edges, sewing on trim, fastening buttons or \"press-studs,\" and pinning the waistline, but she quickly advanced to second-class and then first-class artisan.\n[1897-11-03 20:57:49] New Residence | I knew her customers were all ladies of the upper class.\n[1897-11-03 20:58:09] New Residence | I knew that she went to her customers' homes, meaning to the yards of the Stevenes to work, and often one or two of the girls from the shop would accompany her; they were her apprentices.\n[1897-11-03 20:58:29] New Residence | I knew that from then on, Mark would be of little use to her. Of course, as the girl grew up, she would still often have to sew vests for people, but with friends to help, there would be no need for anyone else.\n[1897-11-03 20:58:49] New Residence | I knew that the girl's uncle Mark then applied for a job, starting off as an assistant, coming home at noon each day, and later taking over the position, returning only for dinner.\n[1897-11-03 20:59:09] New Residence | I knew it was fortunate that, a few weeks after the Stevenes moved here, he was finally \"formally appointed.\"\n[1897-11-04 23:30:32] New Residence | I saw that he had enough time to flirt with Françoise. I knew it was extremely difficult to help her get through this initially painful period.\n[1897-11-04 23:30:42] New Residence | I thought that although Steven did not deny that Mark had served as a \"transition drug\" for Françoise, Steven had to admit that at first he had not liked him.\n[1897-11-04 23:30:47] New Residence | I saw Steven up close, and I noticed that his eyes were filled with compassion, sorrow, and confusion. I thought of how Steven's round, ruddy cheeks and the effect they might have had were completely destroyed by that look.\n[1897-11-04 23:30:52] New Residence | I thought that Steven would feel that this would show how seriously ill he was, or how recently he had lost a loved one, and how his spirit had been shaken.\n[1897-11-04 23:30:57] New Residence | I knew, in fact, that he was neither ill nor had any funeral to attend, and he was eloquent. I thought about how Steven had noticed that he always spoke in a cold, mocking way.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:02] New Residence | I thought that Steven considered the inconsistency between a person's gaze and the tone of their voice created some kind of false impression, which not only failed to make people like him, but even seemed to make him feel embarrassed himself.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:07] New Residence | I thought of someone who, dressed in a short jacket, attends a party and feels embarrassed upon seeing everyone else in tailcoats, or of someone who must answer a nobleman's question but doesn't know where to start, so he just speaks nonsense to get out of the situation.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:12] New Residence | I was only using Steven as an example, but on the contrary, Mark always spoke in a smooth and pleasing manner.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:17] New Residence | I thought that Steven would soon realize he possessed an extraordinary intelligence, which perhaps corresponded to the look of compassion, sadness, and confusion that spread across his face, although once we became familiar with him, we stopped noticing his eyes.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:22] New Residence | I thought of his extraordinary intelligence, the kind possessed by the most literary-minded person Steven had ever known, meaning that although he wasn't highly educated, he could master or grasp the most beautiful expressions of language after merely skimming a few books.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:27] New Residence | I thought of the most talented people Steven had known, all of whom had died young, and so Steven declared that Mark would soon die as well.\n[1897-11-04 23:31:32] New Residence | I thought of Steven, feeling that he was kind-hearted, compassionate, and sensitive with a rich and delicate nature.",

I thought of how, even, Steven noticed how Françoise would skillfully use the moments when a supplier or servant came to deliver something, waiting in the kitchen for Robert's response.\n[1897-11-11 02:23:38] New Residence | I saw her act as if she didn't care, continuing with her work, but with a cold expression she just pointed them to a chair and indicated they should sit down.\n[1897-11-12 22:38:10] New Residence | I thought like this: when this supplier or servant left, Steven imagined that their minds usually retained the impression: \"The Stevenes don't have it, because the Stevenes don't want it.\"\n[1897-11-12 22:38:15] New Residence | I knew she said \"Steven has some money\" as \"Steven has money,\" because she didn't use the partitive article that Peter used. I thought, in addition, that Steven understood that her insistence on making others know that the Stevenes were rich, that they were very wealthy, was not because, in her eyes, wealth was the highest of all things.\n[1897-11-12 22:38:20] New Residence | I thought that it was not because she lacked morality, but rather that she did not have wealth either, and that wealth was a necessary condition in her eyes. Without wealth, morality had no value, no charm.\n[1897-11-12 22:38:25] New Residence | I thought she rarely separated wealth from morality, and in the end, confused them, believing that morality brings comfort and that wealth offers enlightenment and education.\n[1897-11-12 22:38:30] New House Kitchen | After I saw the window close, Françoise sighed and quickly began to clear the kitchen table. I thought, may be she knows that Robert would say any kind of insult.\n[1897-11-18 11:21:54] New House Kitchen | \"I heard the valet say, 'There are still people from the Fairhaven family living on Chair Street. Steven had a friend who worked there, as the second coachman. Steven knew a man who wasn't Steven's friend, but rather the brother-in-law of Steven's friend, and he had served in the same regiment as one of Baron Fairhaven' coachmen.\"\n[1897-11-18 11:21:59] New Kitchen | \"I heard 'Well, let him be, it's not Steven's father anyway?' The valet added with a joke. \"\n[1897-11-18 11:22:04] New House Kitchen | I saw that when he rambled on about his old, worn-out stories, he always inserted a couple of fresh jokes in between. I thought Steven had noticed his habit.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:09] New House Kitchen | I knew that Françoise was getting old and her eyesight was failing. I thought that although she could still see the things on the horizon of Sunrise, Steven failed to understand the joke in the servant's words.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:14] New House Kitchen | I thought, but she felt there should be a joke here, since it didn't connect with what came next.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:19] New Kitchen | I thought, and she knew that the person who said such a weighty statement was usually very fond of joking.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:24] New Kitchen | I saw and she smiled at me, broad and admiring. I thought to myself, \"This Victor, still the same temper!\"\n[1897-11-18 11:22:29] New Kitchen | I thought, after all, Steven was also happy in his heart to see her, because she knew that hearing such witty remarks was somewhat connected with the pleasures of the refined society.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:34] New House Kitchen | I thought of Steven, who knew that people from all social classes rushed to dress up in order to obtain this pleasure, even risking catching a cold.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:39] New House Kitchen | I knew because he often indignantly revealed to her the horrifying measures the Republic was about to take against the clergy. I thought of saying that she considered this footman to be one of her friends.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:44] New Kitchen | I thought that Françoise still didn't understand that the most cruel adversaries were not those who held different views from Steven and tried to persuade him.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:49] New House Kitchen | I thought of those people who stoke the fire, fabricate trouble, and make Stevens feel uneasy with some bad news.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:54] New House Kitchen | I thought that they would fear that the Stevenes might have even the slightest reason to alleviate their suffering, to create a faint favorable impression toward the victors.\n[1897-11-18 11:22:59] New House Kitchen | I thought that in order to inflict the greatest suffering on the Stevenes, they insisted on proving to them that the other side was not only merciless but also thoroughly delighted.\n[1897-11-19 13:35:27] New Kitchen | I saw Françoise returning to the topic of Goulmeynes on Chair Street, like re-playing a slow movement of a sonata. \"I heard that Edward and those people might be related by marriage. Steven couldn't remember who told him, but someone among them had married a cousin to Monsieur Samuel. Anyway, they were all in the same 'parenthesis.'\"\n[1897-11-19 13:35:32] New Kitchen | I saw her add with the utmost reverence. I heard, \"Gautremont is quite an 'aristocratic family'!\"\n[1897-11-20 15:48:01] New Kitchen | I thought about how, based on the size of the family and its illustrious reputation, she had declared it a \"big\" family, just as Pascal had established the truth of religion by relying on reason and the authority of the Bible.\n[1897-11-20 15:48:06] New Kitchen | I thought that since both things could only be described by the single word \"big,\" they had, in her eyes, become one and the same.\n[1897-11-20 15:48:11] New Kitchen | I thought that, in this way, her vocabulary also became flawed, like certain gems, and even cast a shadow on Françoise's mind.\n[1897-11-20 15:48:16] New House Kitchen | I heard Steven musing that perhaps the \"someone\" had a castle in Fairhaven village, ten miles from Sunrise. If that were the case, they would be related to the Algerian cousin from the Fairhaven family.\n[1897-11-20 15:48:21] New Kitchen | I wondered who this Algiers cousin could be? Steven and Robert tried to figure it out for a long time.\n[1897-11-20 15:48:26] New House Kitchen | I knew later that the Stevenes eventually figured it out: what Françoise had meant by Algiers was actually Angers.\n[1897-11-20 15:48:46] New House Kitchen | I thought that places farther away might be more famous than those nearby.\n[1897-11-21 18:01:00] New House Kitchen | I knew that Françoise didn't know Angers, but she did know Algiers, because on New Year's Day the Marceaux received a package of very unattractive Algiers dates.\n[1897-11-21 18:01:20] New Kitchen | I thought of her vocabulary, especially her place names, which were also full of errors, like the French language itself.\n[1897-11-21 18:01:25] New Kitchen | I saw \"Steven had long wanted to have a chat with their household manager... What was his name again?\" She paused, as if asking herself a polite question, then answered it herself. \"I heard, 'Ah, yes, he's called Antoine.'\"\n[1897-11-21 18:01:30] New Kitchen | I thought that Antoine seemed like a title or a noble rank.\n[1897-11-21 18:01:35] New Kitchen | I heard Françoise add, as if she were Madame de Sévigné, using the phrase \"disdainful affection.\" \"I heard him say, 'He could have had a chat with Steven and the others, but he put on this nobleman's air, like a man of learning, as if his tongue had been cut out, or may be he just forgot how to speak. When you talk to him, he always acts as though he doesn't even hear you.'\"\n[1897-11-21 18:01:40] New Kitchen | I saw her say it again with genuine sincerity. I heard him say, \"But since Steven knows that Steven has something to eat, he doesn't bother with other people's business. After all, this guy isn't very good. Besides, he's not a brave man either.\"\n[1897-11-21 18:01:45] New House Kitchen | I knew that in Sunrise, she considered people who acted like beasts to be brave, but here, what she meant by bravery was diligence. I thought this remark would make people believe that Françoise's understanding of courage had changed from what it had been before.\n[1897-11-21 18:01:50] New House Kitchen | I heard that some people said he was a habitual thief. But what they said wasn't necessarily reliable. Because the concierge was jealous and often spread rumors to Edward, all the servants in the house had left. However, one thing was certain: this Antoine was a big lazybones, and his \"Antoines\" weren't any better.",

I thought that when Steven imagined Françoise creating the feminine form of the name Antoine, \"Antoinette,\" according to grammatical rules, she might have unconsciously referred to Chanoine and Chanoinesse.\n[1897-11-22 20:14:09] New Kitchen | I thought she had her reasons, and indeed, Françoise was a contemporary of those French people.\n[1897-11-22 20:14:14] New House Kitchen | I thought to myself, Steven will soon see it, and there's another noun whose feminine form is also constructed in this way.\n[1897-11-22 20:14:19] New Kitchen | I heard that François also said, \"But it's absolutely certain that Fairhaven belongs to Edward. She's the mayor of the town, which is quite impressive.\"\n[1897-11-22 20:14:24] New House Kitchen | I heard the servant say confidently, \"Steven understands, it's truly remarkable.\" I thought so, but he didn't catch the sarcasm in her words.\n[1897-11-22 20:14:29] New House Kitchen | I heard, \"Steven's child, do you really think that's impressive? But for people like them, being a mayor and a deputy mayor is beneath their dignity. Ah! If Fairhaven belonged to Steven, Steven wouldn't be hanging around Willowbrook so much.\"\n[1897-11-22 20:14:34] New House Kitchen | I heard him say, \"People like Monsieur and Madame Steven, wealthy landowners, people who are so rich, one can't imagine what goes through their heads to want to stay in this stifling city instead of going back to Sunrise. They're free now, no one is holding them back. They have everything they need, why wait until retirement? Why not go back after they're dead?\"\n[1897-11-22 20:14:39] New Kitchen | \"I heard him say, 'Ah! If Steven had dry bread to chew and firewood to keep warm in the winter, he would have already returned to his poor little house in Sunrise with his brothers. There, at least, Steven felt he was living, without these houses blocking his view, quiet all around, and at night you could hear the croaking of frogs two miles away.\"\n[1897-11-22 20:14:44] New Kitchen | I saw the young servant exclaim in admiration. I heard, \"This is truly beautiful, madam.\" I thought that this last feature was inherent to Sunrise, just as a gondola is an essential characteristic of Oakdale.\n[1897-11-23 06:59:45] New House Kitchen | I knew that the footman came to Steven's house a little later than the personal valet. What he said to Françoise didn't matter to him personally, as long as Françoise was interested.\n[1897-11-23 06:59:50] New House Kitchen | I saw Françoise frown and pout whenever she saw someone treating her like a servant. I thought, but when the footman spoke of her, he always called her \"the housekeeper,\" so she was always especially kind to him.\n[1897-11-23 06:59:55] New House Kitchen | I thought of some second-rate princes, who also show a similar fondness when they see a sincere young man addressing them as \"Your Highness.\"\n[1897-11-23 07:00:00] New House Kitchen | I heard him say, \"At least people know what they're doing and what season it is. Unlike here, where Easter and Christmas are the same, not even a single flower bud can be seen. In the morning, when Steven gets up with his old frame, he can't even hear the bell for prayer.\"\n[1897-11-23 07:00:05] New House Kitchen | I heard the words: \"In Sunrise, the clock rings every hour, although there is only a pitiful little clock. But then you will say: 'It's time for Steven's brother to come back from the fields.' You watch the sun set, and people ring the bell to pray for happiness in the world. You can be home before the lights are lit.\"\n[1897-11-23 07:00:10] New Kitchen | I heard him say, \"Here, after the day ends, it's night. When it gets dark, you go to sleep. What you did during the day, you probably can't explain any better than an animal could.\"\n[1897-11-23 07:00:15] New Kitchen | I recalled the Meseglise Church, which Steven and the others had spoken about at the dinner table, and I interrupted her. I heard, \"Madame, isn't Messagerie also very beautiful, isn't it?\" I thought that, according to his wishes, the conversation had turned to abstract topics.\n[1897-11-23 07:00:20] New Kitchen | I saw Françoise smiling with delight. \"I heard 'Ah! Messelis!'\"\n[1897-11-25 00:40:17] New House Kitchen | Every time someone mentioned the church of Sainte-Cecile, Sunrise, and the village of Véry, she would always smile uncontrollably. I thought these names were part of her life.\n[1897-11-25 00:40:22] New House Kitchen | I would feel a sweet sensation whenever she encountered or heard these names outside or in conversation. I thought of how students, upon hearing a professor subtly allude to a prominent figure of the present, would be taken by surprise and burst into an excited commotion, like water coming to a boil.\n[1897-11-25 00:40:27] New House Kitchen | I thought of Françoise's pleasure because there were things in those places that belonged only to her and not to anyone else; they were her old friends, with whom she had played.\n[1897-11-25 00:40:32] New Kitchen | I saw her smile at them. I thought of them as having souls, because she found many things about herself in them.\n[1897-11-25 00:40:37] New House Kitchen | I saw her wink and say again. I heard, \"Yes, Steven's child, you can say that Messagerie is quite pretty. But how come you know about Messagerie, you?\"\n[1897-11-25 00:40:42] New Kitchen | I heard, \"You're asking how Steven found out? Isn't he well-known? People have talked to Steven about it, many times.\" I thought of his answer, which was vague and unclear, like that of someone who hesitates to give false information.\n[1897-11-25 00:40:47] New Kitchen | I thought that whenever the Stevenes wanted to objectively find out whether a matter concerning the Stevenes had any significant relation to others, they could never give the Stevenes a satisfactory answer.\n[1897-11-26 02:53:15] New Kitchen | I heard, \"Ah! Steven assures you that the air under the cherry tree is extremely fresh, unlike here by the stove.\"\n[1897-11-26 02:53:20] New Kitchen | I knew she even told them about John, saying she was a good woman. I thought of how John had been very unkind to Françoise when she was alive, but after her death, Françoise had long since forgotten all about it.\n[1897-11-26 02:53:25] New House Kitchen | I knew that John had to use clever tricks every week to get Steven's aunt to give him some pocket money. I thought of her toward John as she would be toward any person who, lacking clothes and food, starving and talentless, came into the homes of the wealthy to \"put on airs\" by relying on their charity — she didn't really like such people.\n[1897-11-26 02:53:30] New Kitchen | I knew that now, Françoise no longer had to put up with John. I thought of Steven's great-aunt, who never stopped praising her.\n[1897-11-26 02:53:35] New House Kitchen | \"I heard the young footman ask, 'You were already in Sunrise, at the home of your aunt's cousin, back then?'\"\n[1897-11-26 02:53:40] New Kitchen | \"I heard, 'Yes, at Madame Octave's. Well, she's a saint, Steven's children. Her house is always full of nice things to offer you, all the finest stuff. A kind-hearted woman, you can say that.\"\n[1897-11-26 02:53:45] New Kitchen | I heard him say, \"She has no pity for little quails, or wild pheasants, or anything else. You can come to her house in groups of five or six, there's plenty of meat, all top quality, and white wine and red wine, everything you want.\" I thought of Françoise using the verb \"pity,\" which has the same meaning as La Bruyère's \"stinginess.\"\n[1897-11-26 02:53:50] New Kitchen | I heard, \"She would cover all the expenses, even if a whole family came to visit and stayed for months, or even years.\" I thought of her words, which would not offend anyone, because in Françoise's time, \"expenses\" did not refer only to \"court fees,\" but rather to general \"expenses.\"",

The parish priest has often told Steven that if there is a woman who can go to the merciful God, it's definitely her.'\"\n[1897-11-26 02:54:00] New Kitchen | I heard her say, \"Poor Mrs. -- Steven still seems to hear her speaking in a high-pitched voice to Steven: 'Françoise, you know, Steven can't eat, but Steven would like you to act as if Steven were eating too, so that you'll prepare the food for everyone.' Of course, not for her.\"\n[1897-11-26 02:54:05] New Kitchen | I heard him say, \"If you had been there, you would have seen her weight was no more than a bag of cherries, no one was that light. She wouldn't believe Steven, she never wanted to see a doctor.\"\n[1897-11-26 02:54:10] New Kitchen | \"I heard, 'Ah! There, you eat without rushing. She wants her servants to be well-fed and comfortable. Unlike here, today, the Stevenes were so rushed they didn't even have time for a snack. Everything is done in a hurry.'\"\n[1897-11-27 19:00:05] New House Kitchen | I knew she was especially annoyed by James's habit of eating dry toast. I thought she was certain that James was putting on airs, trying to \"command\" herat will.\n[1897-11-27 19:00:10] New Kitchen | I saw the young servant nodding in agreement. I heard \"Steven can say, Steven has never seen such a thing before.\" I thought he seemed to know everything, as if he had lived a thousand years, and was thoroughly familiar with all the countries of the world and their customs; it seemed as though one could travel all over the world and still not find the habit of eating toasted bread crumbs.\n[1897-11-27 19:00:15] New House Kitchen | I saw the steward mutter something. I heard, \"Yes, yes. But everything will change. The Canadian workers might be on strike. One evening, the minister told Mr. Steven that he had gotten ten thousand francs for this.\"\n[1897-11-27 20:00:05] New House Kitchen | I thought that Steven saw the steward had no intention of blaming the minister, not because he himself was upright, but because he believed that no one in politics was free from corruption.\n[1897-11-27 20:00:10] New House Kitchen | I thought to myself that embezzlement was not as serious as even the lightest theft.\n[1897-11-27 20:00:15] New House Kitchen | I thought to myself whether it was reasonable that he didn't even ask himself if he had misunderstood the weighty words, which were told by the criminal to James, and yet James hadn't sent him out of the house.\n[1897-11-27 20:00:20] New Kitchen | I thought, but the philosophy of Sunrise restrained Françoise's actions; she could not possibly hope that the strikes in Canada would have an effect on the habit of eating dry bread.\n[1897-11-28 17:09:17] New House Kitchen | I heard her say, \"As long as the world remains the world, just watch, there will always be masters who can have Stevenes running around in circles, and there will always be servants who do as they please, acting on their own.\"\n[1897-11-28 17:09:22] New Kitchen | I knew that Françoise was busy, but Steven and Robert had been nagging for a quarter of an hour already: \"What are they doing? They've been at the table for more than two hours.\" I thought that Steven and Robert probably used a different unit for measuring meal times than Françoise did.\n[1897-11-28 17:09:27] New Kitchen | I saw her hesitantly ring the bell three or four times.\n[1897-11-28 17:09:37] New House Kitchen | I saw Françoise, her footman, and the steward pay no attention to the bell at all, not even bothering to answer it. I thought of it as the first few notes a musician tunes his instrument with, and the concert was about to resume—there were only a few minutes left before the intermission ended.\n[1897-11-28 17:09:42] New Kitchen | I saw that, when the bell kept ringing and grew more insistent, Steven's servant finally took notice. They realized time was short and they had to get back to work.\n[1897-11-28 17:09:52] New House Kitchen | I saw that when another \"ding-ling\" rang, even louder than the previous ones, they finally sighed and each made up their minds.\n[1897-11-28 17:10:02] New Kitchen | I saw the footman go to the door to smoke, Françoise go up to her seventh-floor room to tidy her clothes, and the head of the household go to Steven's room to find some writing paper, quickly writing a private letter and sending it off.\n[1897-11-29 12:49:05] New Residence | I knew that although the steward of the Fairhaven family was proud and haughty, within a few days Françoise found out and told Steven that the Fairhaven family was not occupying the mansion by virtue of some ancient right, but rather by a lease signed only recently.\n[1897-11-29 12:49:10] New Residence | I saw the mansion's garden—the place where Steven had not yet been—and it was as tiny and miserable as all the other gardens adjoining the houses.\n[1897-11-29 12:49:15] New Residence | I saw Steven unable to see the lord's gallows, the defensive windmills, the escape passages, the pigeon lofts on the pillars; the communal oven, the granaries with corridors, the small castles, the bridges, drawbridges, or simple wooden bridges, the toll collectors; the spires of the bell tower, the charters carved into the walls, or the stone piles used as road signs. I thought to myself that Steven had finally found out that none of this was visible in Fairhaven.\n[1897-11-29 12:49:20] New Residence | I know that when Riverside lost its former mystery in Steven's eyes and became just another part of the vast salty waters of the earth, interchangeable with any other salty expanse, George told Steven that it was the milky white bay from Whistler's painting, where the silver and blue tones were beautifully harmonized. I thought of his words, and Riverside suddenly regained its personality.\n[1897-11-29 12:49:25] New Residence | I saw something similar; one day, just as the name Fairhaven was about to collapse under the violent assault of Françoise, a old friend of James spoke of Edward.\n[1897-12-07 10:25:42] New Residence | I heard him say to the Stevenes, \"She holds the highest status in Saint-Germain, and she has a first-rate house in Saint-Germain.\"\n[1897-12-09 00:21:02] New Residence | I thought that, indeed, the first-rate salons and first-rate houses of the Saint-Germain district were nothing compared to the homes that Steven had dreamed of before.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:07] New Residence | I thought, but this house—perhaps the last one—though extremely simple, still retained its value. It went beyond its material form and became a secret distinguishing mark.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:12] New Residence | I saw Edward walking in the morning and taking a carriage in the afternoon. I thought of Steven, who never managed to uncover the mystery of her name.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:17] New Residence | I thought that, therefore, Steven felt he had to go to her \"salon\" and look for her among her friends.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:22] New Residence | I know that, indeed, long ago in the church at Sunrise, she had appeared to Steven in a radiant and glorious form, replacing Steven's shattered dream. I thought of Steven recalling that scene.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:27] New Residence | I thought of Steven, feeling the dazzling colors of the Fairhaven name and the brilliant afternoon sunlight by the Véronne, which could not penetrate her cheeks.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:32] New Residence | I thought that to Steven, she was like a swan or a willow tree, a goddess or fairy come down from the heavens, submitting to the laws of nature, gliding across the water or swaying in the wind.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:37] New Residence | I thought, but Steven had just left her, and those already vanished images immediately reappeared behind the oar that was shattering them, like the red and green reflections of the dying sun.\n[1897-12-09 00:21:42] New Residence | I thought that at this point, the name quickly took the place of the face in Steven's lonely thoughts.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:25] New Residence | I saw her, but now Steven often sees her, at her window, in the courtyard, on the street.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:30] New Residence | I thought that even if Steven was unable to unite the name Fairhaven with her, unable to imagine that she was Edward, at least Steven could blame Steven's own mind for its inability, for not being able to carry out what Steven had asked of it.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:35] New Residence | I thought of her, Steven's neighbor, who seemed to have made the same mistake as Steven.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:40] New Residence | I thought of even worse things: Steven found out that she had done something wrong, yet she remained completely calm, unlike Steven, who was full of anxiety, and who hadn't even realized it was a mistake.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:45] New Residence | I saw that, and Steven saw Edward dressed in a fresh, distinctive outfit. I thought of how she showed an interest in fashion, as if she were certain she was no different from other women, longing to dress herself beautifully and elegantly.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:50] New Residence | I thought that if this were the case, Steven felt that any woman could rival her, even perhaps surpass her slightly.\n[1897-12-11 07:59:55] New Residence | I saw Steven looking at her on the street, staring intently at an elegantly dressed actress. I thought of Steven seeing her expression of envy.\n[1897-12-11 08:00:00] New Residence | I saw the morning, before she set out on her walk, Steven could see her from afar as she brushed her hair in front of the mirror. I thought that the pedestrians' judgments were like a verdict on her. When she unreservedly revealed her mysterious life to them, her elegance seemed to highlight their vulgarity.\n[1897-12-11 08:00:05] New Residence | I thought of a queen, like one about to play the role of a maid in a court comedy, confidently, sincerely, passionately and proudly, yet nervously, playing the part of an elegant lady utterly unsuitable for her station.\n[1897-12-11 08:00:10] New Residence | I saw her glance at the short veil to check if it was straight, smooth out the wrinkles on her sleeves, and adjust her coat. I thought it was incredible that Steven believed she had completely forgotten her noble birth.\n[1897-12-11 08:00:15] New Residence | I saw her suddenly grab the door handle or her umbrella. I thought of the swan, a god transformed into a swan, performing all the actions of its kind, its two painted eyes guarding the sides of its beak, entirely in the manner of a swan, forgetting that it was a god and not a swan.\n[1897-12-11 08:00:20] New Residence | I thought, but just as a tourist who arrives in a city and is disappointed by its appearance might console himself by thinking he should at least visit the museum, get to know the locals, or go to the library, perhaps gaining a deeper sense of its charm.\n[1897-12-11 08:00:25] New Residence | I thought that Steven was also like this visitor, and to himself, Steven would say that if Steven were a guest at Edward's house, if Steven were one of her friends, if Steven were to go deep into her life, Steven would surely learn that beneath her dazzling orange shell, her name carried for others a truly objective and real meaning.",

    "text": "[1897-12-14 09:48:31] New Residence | I knew, because James's friend had said so, that the environment of the Fairhaven family was unique in Saint-Germain.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:08] Hall of Thought | I thought about the life that Steven imagined existing in this environment, which was entirely different from ordinary life, and Steven felt it should be unique.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:13] Hall of Thought | I thought that, therefore, Steven could not imagine that the kind of people who had often come to him before would appear at Edward's dinner party—real people.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:18] Hall of Thought | I thought that because the country may change, but human nature remains, they would only spit out some unremarkable words that Steven had grown accustomed to hearing.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:23] Hall of Thought | I thought the speaker must condescend, using the language of people like them to talk to them.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:28] Hall of Thought | I wondered how one could imagine that, in this first-rate salon of Saint-Germain, there would one evening be moments like those Steven had once experienced.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:33] New Residence | I saw that every morning, Steven could hear the sound of them beating the furniture in the bedroom. I thought to myself that indeed, Steven's mind was no longer functioning. The mystery of the Eucharist, the real presence of Christ in the host, was already enough to baffle Steven, but compared to the salons of the first-rate district on the Right Bank, it was nothing more than a minor miracle.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:38] New Residence | I thought, but the boundary line that separated Steven from the Saint-Germain district, although imagined, became all the more real for Steven because of it.\n[1897-12-14 14:23:43] New Residence | I thought that Steven truly felt that the straw mat in the Fairhaven house across the equator was already Saint-Germain.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:25] New Residence | I saw one day that their house door was open, and Steven and Robert also saw the mat from afar. I heard her say that it was too old.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:30] New Residence | I also saw their dining room and the dimly lit corridor with red velvet furniture, which Steven sometimes could see from the window of his own family's kitchen. I couldn't help but think that this must make Steven believe they possessed the mysterious charm of the Saint-Germain district, that they were a major part of it, and that, geographically speaking, they were located right in the district.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:35] New Residence | I thought that being received in this restaurant was no different from going to the Saint-Germain district and breathing its air; because those who sat on the sofa next to Edward before dining were regulars from the Saint-Germain district.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:40] Hall of Thought | I thought, of course, that outside the Saint-Germain district, at certain dinners, one could occasionally see a couple of such people mingling among a group of insipidly refined individuals, appearing solemn in their manner—people whose names were all they had.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:45] Hall of Thought | I thought of how the Stevenes, when trying to imagine their appearances, would sometimes resemble a competition and sometimes a public forest.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:50] Hall of Thought | I saw it here, in the first-rate salons of the Saint-Germain district, in the dim corridor, with no one else there besides them. I thought that Steven believed they were the columns supporting the church, made of precious materials.\n[1897-12-15 13:16:55] Hall of Thought | I thought that even at a small gathering, Edward could only choose her guests among them, twelve people feasting around a cloth-covered table laden with delicacies, like the golden statues of Christ's twelve apostles in front of a sanctuary altar, symbolic pillars of the consecration.\n[1897-12-15 13:17:00] Hall of Thought | I saw that the small garden, nestled behind the mansion between high walls, was set up with liqueurs and orange water after the evening banquet in summer. I thought, Steven couldn't help but imagine, sitting in the iron chair in the garden between nine and eleven at night—the iron chair had the same magical power as the leather sofa. How could he not breathe in the special breeze of Saint-Germain district, just as one couldn't help but be in Africa while taking a nap in the Fes oasis?\n[1897-12-15 13:17:05] Hall of Thought | I thought that only imagination and faith could distinguish other things and people, could create a certain atmosphere.\n[1897-12-15 13:17:10] Hall of Thought | I thought, alas! The colorful scenery of Saint-Germain, the undulating natural terrain, the local antiques, the works of art—Steven would probably never have the chance to enter among them in his whole life.\n[1897-12-15 13:17:15] Hall of Thought | I thought that as long as Steven could catch a distant glimpse of that old straw mat, like a sailor seeing the minaret of a mosque, the first palm tree, the exotic factory chimney, and plants on the shore from far out at sea, he would be content and overjoyed, even if he could never approach it.\n[1897-12-15 13:17:20] New Residence | I knew, according to Samuel's view, its territory should extend very far. I thought that for Steven, Fairhaven began at the door of its vestibule.\n[1897-12-15 13:17:25] New Residence | I thought of Samuel, who regarded all his tenants as peasants, commoners, buyers of state property, and considered their opinions insignificant.\n[1897-12-18 14:29:54] Courtyard | I saw him early in the morning, shaving at the window in his nightgown, then going down into the courtyard. I saw that according to his sense of temperature, he sometimes wore a shirt, sometimes a dressing gown, sometimes a rare-colored Scottish wool plaid overcoat, and sometimes a light-colored short coat that was even shorter than his usual jacket.\n[1897-12-18 14:30:04] Courtyard | I saw him having one of his grooms lead his newly bought horse for a trot in the courtyard. I knew that the horse had smashed up Mark's shop more than once, and Mark had demanded compensation, which made Samuel furious.\n[1897-12-18 14:30:14] Courtyard | I heard Samuel say, \"Edward has done so much good in this mansion and this parish, yet this guy still wants Steven to pay money—what a scoundrel!\"\n[1897-12-18 14:30:19] Courtyard | I saw it, but Mark did not move an inch. I thought that perhaps I had never even known whether Edward had ever done good.\n[1897-12-18 14:30:24] Courtyard | I thought, but she was indeed doing good, yet just as one cannot expect everyone to do good, something that makes a person feel proud should never be boasted about in front of others, lest it cause resentment.\n[1897-12-18 14:30:29] Courtyard | I thought that, from any perspective other than that of doing good, Monsieur Samuel had always regarded his own region as an extension of his own courtyard—extending far, far away, the vast racetrack for his horse.\n[1897-12-19 17:57:33] Courtyard | After letting his new horse run alone for a while, he ordered the coachman to hitch it to the carriage and take it for a drive along the nearby streets.\n[1897-12-19 17:57:43] Courtyard | I saw the coachman holding the reins, running around the carriage, and the horse passing back and forth in front of Samuel. I saw Samuel standing on the sidewalk. He was tall and stout, wearing light-colored clothes, a cigar in his mouth, his head held high, and wearing an odd monocle.\n[1897-12-19 17:57:53] Courtyard | I saw him then jump onto the carriage, wanting to try it himself. I knew he had gone to the Champs-Élysées in his new carriage to visit his mistress.\n[1897-12-19 17:58:03] Courtyard | I saw Samuel greeting two couples in the courtyard, who were somehow connected to his circle. I knew that one pair were his cousins, like the working-class couples, who never took care of their children at home, because early in the morning the wife would go to the \"Music School\" to teach harmonic progression and fugue, while the husband would go to the carving room to work on wood and embossed leather.\n[1897-12-19 17:58:13] Courtyard | I saw another couple: Baron Paul and his wife. They always wore black, and the wife looked like a woman who rented out chairs, while the husband resembled a man who handled funerals. They went to church several times a day.\n[1897-12-19 17:58:28] Courtyard | I knew they were the nephew of a former ambassador. This former ambassador was a long-time acquaintance of the Steven family.\n[1897-12-20 21:25:12] Courtyard | I once saw James happen to meet him under the arch of the staircase. I wondered in my heart how he had come here.\n[1897-12-20 21:25:17] Courtyard | I thought that because James believed that a man of such standing, who had often dealt with Europe's most distinguished figures, would surely have no interest in the superficial honors of nobility, and should not associate with these obscure, short-sighted, and reactionary nobles.\n[1897-12-20 21:25:22] Courtyard | I saw that the baron and baroness had not been in the house long when Mark approached Samuel in the courtyard, greeting him as \"Mr. Paul,\" since he didn't know his exact name.\n[1897-12-20 21:25:32] Courtyard | I saw Samuel turn to the baron and shout loudly. \"I heard, 'Ah! Mr. Paul. Ah! What a fine name! Be patient! Later this man will call you Citizen Paul!\"\n[1897-12-20 21:25:37] Courtyard | I thought he finally had the chance to take his revenge on Mark, who had only called him \"sir\" and not \"Mr. Samuel.\"\n[1897-12-20 21:25:42] Courtyard | One day, when Samuel wanted to find out James's profession, he came in person, putting on an air of gentle refinement. I knew that from then on, he would often come to talk to James, with or without a reason.\n[1897-12-23 20:49:05] Courtyard | I saw Samuel leave his carriage attendant and come into the courtyard as soon as he saw James coming down the stairs (in fact, James was considering a job and didn't want to meet anyone).",

I thought of myself as a high-class prostitute, shamelessly wanting to prove to him that he was always ready to offer up his precious body.\n[1897-12-30 12:05:27] Courtyard | I saw him let go only when he had walked him all the way to the gate of the public road.\n[1898-01-01 17:10:49] Courtyard | I thought that James was thoroughly fed up with him, and he was only thinking of getting rid of him.\n[1898-01-01 17:10:54] Street | One day, I saw him and his wife driving out, and they met the Stevenes. He greeted them warmly and introduced Steven to his wife.\n[1898-01-03 13:25:27] Street | I thought that if she could remember Steven's name and face, Steven would be truly blessed.\n[1898-01-03 13:25:32] Street | I thought, after all, Steven was introduced to her only as one of her boarders, and such an introduction was utterly humiliating!\n[1898-01-03 13:25:37] Street | It would have been so good if Steven had met and been introduced to Edward at the Charles house!\n[1898-01-09 02:09:05] Street | I knew, moreover, that Charles had invited Steven to her house through his grandmother.\n[1898-01-10 22:23:38] Street | I knew that when she found out Steven had decided to become a writer, she specifically mentioned that Steven could meet some writers in her home.\n[1898-01-12 18:38:05] Street | I know that James, however, thought Steven was still too young to enter society, and besides, Steven's health was a real concern; he didn't want to give Steven any unnecessary opportunities to go out.\n[1898-01-12 18:38:10] Kitchen | I saw one of Edward's servants often chatting with Françoise. I knew Steven had heard him mention a few salons she often frequented.\n[1898-01-12 18:38:20] Kitchen | I thought, but what were these salons like? Steven could never imagine them. Since they were a part of her life, and Steven could only glimpse her life through her name, they must remain unknowable, then?\n[1898-01-12 18:38:25] Kitchen | \"I heard the servant say, 'There's a grand party at Princess Palma's tonight, with a puppet show. But Steven won't be able to go. Madame has to catch the five o'clock train to Chantilly to stay at Omar Samuel's for two days, and the lady's maid and footman are going with her. Steven will stay behind. Princess Palma will be upset; she's written Edward four or five letters already.\"\n[1898-01-12 18:38:30] Kitchen | \"I heard, 'So, you're not going back to Fairhaven this year?'\"\n[1898-01-12 18:38:35] Kitchen | \"I heard that 'it's not going to happen this time, for the first time ever, because Mr. Samuel has rheumatism. The doctor said that the Marceauxs can't go there unless the heating system is installed. But they've always gone every year before, staying until January. If the heating isn't fixed, may be Madame will spend a few days at her cousin Edward's house in Cannes, but it hasn't been decided yet.'\"\n[1898-01-12 18:38:40] Kitchen | I heard, \"So, do you often go to the theater?\"\n[1898-01-12 18:38:45] Kitchen | \"I heard that sometimes they went to the opera, sometimes to a party hosted by Princess Palma, once a week, with tickets always reserved. There you could have a feast for the eyes, plays, operas, everything you could wish for. Edward didn't like to reserve tickets, but Steven and the others went a few times. Once they sat in a box belonging to a friend of the lady, and another time in another box. Most often, they were in the lower box of the Duchess of Fairhaven, who was the wife of a cousin of Mr. Samuel, the sister of Bavarian Samuel... Are you going up now?\"\n[1898-01-12 18:38:50] Kitchen | I heard the servant say, \"You're in good shape, Madame.\" I thought that although he was technically a member of the Fairhaven family, his concept of nobility was usually political, so he always treated Françoise with courtesy, as if she had also once belonged to the Edward family.\n[1898-01-12 18:38:55] Kitchen | \"I heard him sigh, 'Ah! If only I didn't have this damned leg! Walking on the flat was manageable. But these damned stairs, Steven can't handle them. See you later, sir, may be I'll see you tonight.\" I thought of the plains François said, which actually meant the courtyard and the street, places she always liked to walk through. In short, it was flat land.\n[1898-01-12 18:39:00] Kitchen | I knew that the servant from the Fairhaven family had told her that Samuel's son was often granted a princely title until their father died. I thought that, therefore, Françoise still wanted to talk with him.\n[1898-01-12 18:39:05] Kitchen | I thought that perhaps, in the French people's worship of the aristocracy, there was also a spirit of rebellion mixed in.\n[1898-01-12 18:39:10] Kitchen | I thought that the deeply rooted mentality of both revering and rebelling against the nobility, which had been inherited from the feudal system in France, was probably unshakable.\n[1898-01-12 18:39:15] Kitchen | I saw that if someone spoke to Françoise about Napoleon's genius or the radio, she would ignore them, still raking the ashes from her fireplace and setting the table, her movements never slowing in the least.\n[1898-01-17 21:09:18] Kitchen | I saw that whenever she heard discussions about these special matters of the nobility, especially when they mentioned Samuel's younger son, who was usually called the Prince of Orléans, she would burst out in protest. I heard \"Tut-tut, that's great!\"\n[1898-01-17 21:09:23] Kitchen | I saw her and felt dizzy with admiration. I found myself as if standing before a stained glass window.\n[1898-01-19 03:46:59] Kitchen | I saw the personal valet of Prince de Fairhaven often came to Edward's house to deliver letters, and he was very familiar with Françoise. I knew he had told Françoise that he had actually heard society talking about the marriage between the Marquis de Peter and Mademoiselle d'Ambres-sur-Artois, which was almost certain.\n[1898-01-19 13:59:34] New Residence | I thought of Edward pouring her life into that villa and the lower-level salon, so, to Steven's mind, they were just as magical and dreamlike as her own bedroom.\n[1898-01-19 13:59:39] New Residence | I thought of the names Parma, Fairhaven, Bavaria, and Gisors, which made Edward's villa for her vacation different from all others, and which made the evening parties she attended every day by carriage from the mansion different from all other evenings.\n[1898-01-19 13:59:44] New Residence | I thought, but even though these names told Steven that Edward had a life that continuously existed in those vacation villas and parties, they could not provide Steven with any information about her herself.\n[1898-01-19 13:59:49] New Residence | I thought that each vacation villa, each party gave Edward's life a different certainty, but they only added a layer of mystery to it without revealing the slightest bit of it. It was blocked by a panel, locked inside a jar, and simply flowed along with the tides of other people's lives.\n[1898-01-19 13:59:54] New Residence | I thought of the carnival, and Edward having lunch facing the Mediterranean, but this was at Madame de Guînes's villa. Willowbrook's queen of society was wearing a white crepe dress, and among the numerous princesses, she was merely an ordinary guest, no different from the other women.\n[1898-01-19 13:59:59] New Residence | It made Steven even more entranced, and she herself seemed reborn as a dance star, replacing each of her female partners in a strange and illusory ballet.\n[1898-01-19 14:00:04] New Residence | I thought she could watch a puppet show, but that was at a party given by the Princess of Parma; she could listen to a tragedy or an opera, but that was in the box of the Princess de Fairhaven.\n[1898-01-19 14:00:09] New Residence | I thought how Stevens often concentrate all the various possibilities of a person's life, the memories of the acquaintances he is about to leave or meet, into one individual.",

    "text": "[1898-01-22 12:29:55] New Residence | I saw that, so when Steven learned from Françoise that Edward was going on foot to the Princess Palma's for lunch.\n[1898-01-22 12:30:00] New Residence | I saw, and at nearly noon, when Steven saw her come out of the house, she was wearing a pink silk dress. I saw a face of the same color emerging above the dress, like a patch of colored cloud at sunset.\n[1898-01-22 23:40:36] New Residence | I thought at that moment, and Steven saw all the happiness of the Saint-Germain district laid out before Steven, gathered in her small body, like gathered in a shell, nestled between the glowing petals of the pink pearl layer.\n[1898-01-22 23:40:41] New Residence | I knew that James had a friend in the ministry named A.J. Moreau. To distinguish him from other Moreaus, he always made a point of adding the first two letters of his name before his surname, and in time, everyone just called him A.J.\n[1898-01-22 23:41:01] New Residence | I know, but Steven didn't know how A.J. had managed to get a orchestra seat ticket for the grand opera performance. He sent the ticket to James.\n[1898-01-22 23:41:21] New Residence | I knew that David had given the ticket to Steven because she wanted him to see Arthur perform a scene from \"Hedda Gabler\" (she hadn't seen her act since Steven had first been disappointed by her performance).\n[1898-01-23 23:55:10] New Residence | I thought that, honestly, whether Steven could go to see Arthur act this time didn't really matter, but a few years ago, she had completely captivated him, leaving him utterly entranced.\n[1898-01-23 23:55:15] New Residence | I thought about how Steven felt a sense of loss when he saw that the things he had once been infatuated with, even more cherished than health and rest, no longer interested him.\n[1898-01-23 23:55:20] New Residence | I thought, how often didn't Steven himself want to draw closer in order to quietly observe the precious reality, fragmented into pieces, as seen through his own imagination? And this enthusiasm had not diminished at all.\n[1898-01-23 23:55:25] New Residence | I thought, but now Steven's imagination no longer placed them within the skill of a star actress reciting her lines.\n[1898-01-23 23:55:30] New Residence | I knew that ever since Steven had gone to George's house a few times. I thought of Steven's former admiration for Arthur's recitation skills and his superstition regarding her tragic art, which had now been transferred to certain carpets and modern paintings.\n[1898-01-23 23:55:35] New Residence | I thought that since Steven's beliefs and desires no longer allowed Steven to maintain an eternal worship of Arthur's recitations and gestures, the \"image\" of her in Steven's mind would gradually wither away, just like the \"images\" of the dead in ancient Egypt, which had to be constantly fed in order to sustain their existence.\n[1898-01-23 23:55:40] New Residence | I thought of this art now becoming as thin as paper, easily torn and broken, having lost its inner vitality.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:11] Opera House | I saw Steven using the ticket James had received to ascend the grand staircase of the opera house.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:21] Opera House | I saw Steven notice someone ahead of him. I thought of how Steven had first taken him for M. de Charlus, since his back looked very much like M. de Charlus's.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:26] Opera House | I saw him turn back and ask a theater employee something. I thought that Steven had made a mistake with Steven.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:31] Opera House | I thought, but Steven, based on the stranger's attire and the way he spoke to the male ticket inspector and the female usher—people who didn't immediately respond—unhesitatingly placed him in the social class of M. de Charlus.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:36] Opera House | I thought that although each person had their own characteristics, in that era, there was always a very clear difference between the wealthy, elaborately dressed noblemen and the wealthy, elaborately dressed financiers or industrialists.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:41] Opera House | I thought of financiers or industrialists speaking to their subordinates in an arrogant, unchallengeable manner, and thinking that this was their stylish elegance.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:46] Opera House | I thought that these noblemen would be smiling and amiable, showing a humble and patient demeanor, pretending to be just an ordinary spectator, and considering this a sign of their good upbringing.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:51] Opera House | I thought of how, at this moment, the son of a banker entering the theater would see this nobleman, his face full of smiling kindness, which concealed the insurmountable boundary imposed by his particular class upon him.\n[1898-01-24 08:51:56] Opera House | I thought that if it hadn't been for a wealthy young man who noticed his resemblance to the portrait of the Austrian prince, the Archduke Saxon, currently staying in Willowbrook, I would have taken him for an obscure commoner.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:01] Opera House | I thought that Steven knew he was a close friend of the Fairhaven family.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:06] Opera House | I saw when Steven approached the ticket clerk, I heard the Prince of Saxony—or perhaps the assumed prince—smilingly say. I heard, \"Steven doesn't know which cabin it is. Steven's cousin told Steven, and Steven will find out as soon as he asks.\"\n[1898-01-24 08:52:11] Opera House | I thought perhaps he was the Prince of Saxony.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:16] Opera House | I thought that when he said, \"Steven's cousin told Steven, and Steven would find out by asking,\" the eyes that saw perhaps was Edward.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:21] Opera House | I thought that if she were really there, Steven would be able to catch a glimpse of her life in the balcony below her sister-in-law's apartment, a life that was always beyond Steven's imagination.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:26] Opera House | I thought that, with this distinctive smile in his eyes, these extremely ordinary words, alternatingly caressing Steven's heart with the two feelers of possible happiness and an unreliable reputation.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:31] Opera House | I thought of the warmth they brought to Steven, which was far beyond anything an abstract dream could offer.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:36] Opera House | I thought that, at least, when he said this to the ticket collector, he had connected a possible path to a new world with a mundane evening in Steven's life.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:41] Opera House | I saw the ticket inspector say \"Lower balcony,\" and he pointed toward the corridor, then went inside.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:46] Opera House | I saw that the corridor was unusually damp, its walls cracked and fissured, as if leading to an underwater cave, to the magical kingdom of sea fairies.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:51] Opera House | I saw a gentleman in a formal evening suit walking ahead of Steven, growing smaller and smaller in the distance. I thought, but Steven kept thinking that he was the Prince of Saxe, and that he had to go visit Edward de Fairhaven.\n[1898-01-24 08:52:56] Opera House | I thought of this idea like an awkward mirror, rotating around him but failing to accurately reflect the light onto him.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:01] Opera House | I thought that although he was alone, this thought, which had nothing to do with him, which was intangible, boundless, and jumping unconnectedly like a shadow, seemed to be walking ahead of him, guiding his way.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:06] Opera House | I thought of it as Athena, who never leaves her Greek soldier, but others cannot see her.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:11] Opera House | I saw Steven come to his seat, trying hard to recall a line from the play \"Phaedra.\" I thought of Steven, but I wasn't sure.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:16] Opera House | I thought that, according to the line of verse Steven had memorized, the number of syllables did not match the prescribed count.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:21] Opera House | I thought about it, but since Steven didn't want to count the syllables, he considered that there was no common standard between assessing whether its balance was off and determining whether it was a classical poem.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:26] Opera House | I thought it was so long, even if six or more syllables were removed to make it a twelve-syllable line, Steven would not have been surprised.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:31] Opera House | I saw that, all of a sudden, the uneven, inhuman world's stubborn roughness vanished like magic. I thought of it, but Steven suddenly remembered the line of poetry.\n[1898-01-24 08:53:36] Opera House | I saw the syllables of the poem immediately conforming to the meter of a twelve-syllable verse, the extra syllables like bubbles that burst as soon as they surfaced, disappearing effortlessly and nimbly. I thought about Steven who had wasted half the day thinking about it, when in fact it was only a single extra syllable.",

    "text": "[1898-01-25 09:06:55] Opera House | I knew that some of the orchestra seats were sold at the theater's box office, to people who pretended to be refined or curious ones, wanting to gaze at those people they never had the chance to see up close.\n[1898-01-25 09:07:15] Opera House | I saw the theater had become a salon, with everyone leaving their seats to sit by one or another girlfriend. I know for certain that here, they can openly observe the usually hidden aspects of these people's social lives, because Princess Paloma has given all the boxes on the second floor, the ground floor, and the gallery to her friends.\n[1898-01-25 09:07:30] Opera House | I saw that around Steven were all sorts of vulgar people who didn't recognize the audience that had reserved tickets, yet they tried to pretend they had recognized them, shouting out their names loudly.\n[1898-01-25 09:07:40] Opera House | I saw that they said these people who had reserved tickets came here as if it were their own salon. I thought that their real intention was not to pay attention to the play.\n[1898-01-25 09:07:45] Opera House | I know a talented university student who bought a stall ticket just to hear Arthur sing. I thought, but it was just the opposite—I was only thinking about not soiling his gloves, not interfering with anyone, and getting along well with the person lucky enough to be seated next to him.\n[1898-01-25 09:07:50] Opera House | I saw him occasionally smiling as he tracked a fleeting glance, rudely avoiding a meeting one.\n[1898-01-25 09:08:00] Opera House | I saw a familiar glance, when he spotted the acquaintance in the theater. I thought about how he was flustered and at a loss, but still decided to greet her.\n[1898-01-25 09:08:05] Opera House | I saw him barely manage to reach her side when the three bells rang, and he fled like the Hebrews escaping from the Red Sea, slipping between the two surging waves of male and female spectators.\n[1898-01-25 09:08:15] Opera House | I saw him ordering them to stand up; he trampled their dresses and dirtied their half-boots. I thought this showed that he was fully intent on watching the play.\n[1898-01-25 09:08:20] Opera House | I saw them sitting in the private boxes behind the balustrade of the upper gallery, as if seated in a suspended salon with the partitions removed, or like in a small café serving milk and fern syrup tea. I thought just the opposite: only people from the upper class have the leisure to go to the theater (and of course, they also need to have the intelligence to understand the play).\n[1898-01-25 09:08:25] Opera House | I saw that the golden-framed mirrors and red chairs of this Neapolitan-style building would not frighten me. I thought about how they carelessly placed their hands on the gilded columns that supported this temple of opera, and how they didn't feel the least bit unworthy of the excessive honor bestowed upon them by the two statues with outstretched arms offering laurels and bay to their box.\n[1898-01-26 09:21:08] Opera House | I saw that at first, the surroundings were just dark.\n[1898-01-26 09:21:23] Opera House | I saw that suddenly, people's eyes met a flickering light like phosphorescence coming from the darkness, the gleam of a famous person's eyes, like an invisible gem.\n[1898-01-26 09:21:38] Opera House | I saw the side profile of Omar Samuel as he bent over. I saw it as clearly as Henry IV's portrait on a black enamel badge.\n[1898-01-26 09:21:48] Opera House | I saw a noblewoman hidden in the darkness speaking loudly to him. I heard, \"Your Royal Highness, may Steven take off your coat for you.\"\n[1898-01-26 09:21:53] Opera House | I saw, but the prince replied. I heard, \"I'm not worthy, how could I trouble you, Madame de Bouville.\"\n[1898-01-26 09:21:58] Opera House | I saw that although the prince politely refused, she still insisted on taking off his coat. I thought that she, too, was envied by everyone for receiving this honor.\n[1898-01-26 09:22:03] Opera House | I saw, but in the other compartments, those white goddesses seated in these dim alcoves had all retreated into the inner walls, hiding themselves so that no one could see them.\n[1898-01-26 09:22:18] Opera House | I saw, but as the performance continued, their hazy figures emerged calmly, one after another, from the darkness that was filled with their shadows, rising toward the light.\n[1898-01-26 09:22:33] Opera House | I saw their half-naked bodies, lingering at the vertical boundary of the compartment and on the semi-lit sea.\n[1898-01-26 09:22:48] Opera House | I saw their faces glowing with brilliance, their feather fans creating rolling waves in front of them—light, joyful, splashing with foam. Their crimson hair shimmered with wealth and glamour, as if moving with the rhythm of the sea.\n[1898-01-26 09:23:03] Opera House | I saw that, then the orchestra pit began to take shape.\n[1898-01-26 09:23:18] Opera House | I saw that this was the realm of mortals, forever separated from the dim and transparent maritime kingdom. The clear-eyed gaze of the sea goddess cast its radiant light upon the flat expanse of the sea, marking the boundaries of this kingdom.\n[1898-01-26 09:23:23] Opera House | I saw the folding chairs on the shore, the bizarre shapes in the orchestra, which entered their eyes according to the sole law of perspective and different angles of incidence. I thought that just as for two parts of the external world, for minerals and for people who have nothing to do with Steven, Steven himself would not even bother to smile at them or glance their way, because Steven knew they didn't possess souls like his own.\n[1898-01-26 09:23:28] Opera House | I saw the opposite: within the domain of the Sea Kingdom, the radiant daughter of the sea occasionally turned back, smiling sweetly at the bearded half-man, half-fish god hanging on the winding boundary, or at a sea god who was half human.\n[1898-01-26 09:23:38] Opera House | I saw this half-man, half-god, his skull like a smooth pebble, with a single strand of seaweed, soft and slick from the tide, clinging to it. His eyes were like round disks made of large crystal stones.\n[1898-01-26 09:23:53] Opera House | I saw them lean down and hand them some candy.\n[1898-01-26 09:24:03] Opera House | I once saw the tide open a dry path and welcome a fairy who arrived late, smiling and blushing, like a flower in full bloom just rising from the darkness.\n[1898-01-27 09:35:52] Opera House | I watched a play come to an end, and the nymphs who had been drawn to the surface by the pleasant sounds of the world no longer wished to hear those noises. They all dived back into the sea and vanished into the vast darkness.\n[1898-01-27 09:36:02] Opera House | I thought that Steven considered these curious goddesses to have appeared at the entrance of their hidden places just to take a quick look at mortal works, while mortals could not even approach.\n[1898-01-27 09:36:07] Opera House | I saw that among all these hideouts, the most renowned was the private box belonging to the Princess de Fairhaven, that large rock in semi-darkness.\n[1898-01-27 09:36:22] Opera House | I saw the Duchess of Fairhaven as a great fairy, presiding over the entertainments of the other fairies from afar.\n[1898-01-27 09:36:37] Opera House | I saw her deliberately drawing back, sitting on the side of the sofa. I saw the bright red sofa like a crimson coral reef emerging from the sea.\n[1898-01-27 09:36:47] Opera House | I saw a huge reflection of glass next to me, probably a mirror, like a beam of light shining on the sparkling surface of water, forming a sharp, dark, and flowing plane.\n[1898-01-27 09:36:52] Opera House | I saw a large white flower, fluffy like a wing, hanging down from the Prince's wife's forehead along one side of her cheek, like a feather, like a crown, like a sea flower—exotic, soft, full of life, tender and affectionate.\n[1898-01-27 09:37:07] Opera House | I saw it undulating along the curve of my cheek, covering half my face, like a flesh-colored kingfisher egg hidden in a soft nest.\n[1898-01-27 09:37:22] Opera House | I saw the queen's lady's hair net hanging down to her eyebrows, and then reappearing below, at her throat.\n[1898-01-27 09:37:37] Opera House | I saw that it was made from white shells caught in some southern seas, decorated with pearls, like a mosaic from the sea that had just emerged from the waves, sinking into darkness now and then.\n[1898-01-27 09:37:52] Opera House | I saw that even in the darkness, the princess's sparkling eyes still revealed her presence.\n[1898-01-27 09:38:07] Opera House | I saw her as a vision of heavenly beauty, her face surpassing all others in perfection. Although the girls in the half-light were all lovely and charming, none could compare to her brilliance.\n[1898-01-27 09:38:22] Opera House | I saw that her beauty was not merely physical, that is, in her neck, back, shoulders, arms, and waist.\n[1898-01-27 09:38:37] Opera House | I saw her exquisite, captivating figure as the precise and inevitable starting point of an infinite number of invisible lines, which radiated outward from the princess like the spectrum cast by an ideal statue in half-light, strange and dazzling, giving rise to a cascade of illusions and daydreams.\n[1898-01-27 09:38:52] Opera House | I saw Steven's neighbor say to the man who had come with her, deliberately drawing out the word \"dear\" so that the term sounded ridiculous. I heard \"That's the Duchess of Fairhaven. She's covered in jewels.\" Steven thought, if Steven had that many jewels, Steven would never show them off like she did. Steven thought it was unseemly.\n[1898-01-27 09:38:57] Opera House | I thought that those people who were always asking who had come to see the play would feel that the throne of beauty belonged exclusively to the princess.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:02] Opera House | I know for sure that, like the Countess of Luxembourg Edward, Madame de Morialva, Madame de Sainte-Catherine, and other ladies of high society, their facial features are such that a hare lip and a large red nose are very close together, or else the fine, dense hairs on the upper lip are inseparable from the wrinkles covering their faces.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:07] Opera House | I thought to myself that these features were already fascinating, because although they had only the conventional value of a signature, they made one feel reverent when reading the great name.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:12] Opera House | I thought not only that, but that in the end it would make people believe that an ugly appearance was a distinctive mark of nobility. A noble lady's face just needed to show dignity; whether she was beautiful was irrelevant.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:17] Opera House | I thought, but it was like certain painters who, instead of signing their names at the bottom of the canvas, paint a beautiful design—a butterfly, a lizard, or a flower.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:22] Opera House | I thought that, just like the Duchess of Fairhaven, she had also hidden a beautiful body and an attractive face in a corner of her box, thereby showing that beauty might be the noblest signature.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:27] Opera House | I thought that the people the Duchess of Fairhaven brought to the theater were all people from her own circle, and her presence undoubtedly most convincingly proved the authenticity of the paintings displayed in her box.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:32] Opera House | I thought of this compartment as a glimpse into the unique way of life that the princess led in her residences in Hillside and Willowbrook.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:37] Opera House | I thought of Steven's imagination as a broken hand-cranked organ, always playing a tune that didn't quite match the intended piece.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:42] Opera House | I know that whenever Steven heard someone speak of the Princess de Fairhaven, he always associated her with certain works from the sixteenth century.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:47] Opera House | I saw that she was now right in front of Steven, asking a fat man in a tailcoat to eat an ice cream cone. I thought that, therefore, Steven had to struggle desperately to free himself from these associations she aroused in him.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:52] Opera House | I thought, certainly, Steven could not yet conclude that she was no different from other people with her guests.\n[1898-01-27 09:39:57] Opera House | I thought Steven deeply understood that everything they were doing here was just playing a role; in order to open the curtain on their real life (of course, the most important scene of their lives was not being played here), they had agreed to follow their own customs, which Steven completely failed to understand.\n[1898-01-27 09:40:02] Opera House | I saw one of them pretending to offer candy and the other pretending to refuse. I thought such an action was meaningless, predetermined in advance, like a dancer's steps, sometimes rising on tiptoe, sometimes twirling around a shawl.\n[1898-01-27 09:40:07] Opera House | I saw that Steven was smiling. I thought, who knows? Perhaps the goddess, while handing out candy, would say in a mocking tone, \"Do you want some sugar?\"\n[1898-01-27 09:40:12] Opera House | I thought, but what does this have to do with Steven? Steven seemed to feel that the words, spoken by a goddess to a half-man, half-god, although deliberately cold and abrupt, had the style of Mérimée or Mélaque, and were elegant, beautiful, and endlesslyaftertaste.\n[1898-01-27 09:40:17] Opera House | I thought of that half-man, half-god, and I was very clear about the lofty idea that the two of them were meant to embody, because they were about to relive their true lives.\n[1898-01-27 09:40:22] Opera House | I thought of Steven imagining that he was complying with the rules of the game, speaking in the same mysterious and cunning tone: \"Yes, Steven really wants a cherry.\"\n[1898-01-27 09:40:27] Opera House | I thought of Steven, as if he were listening intently to this conversation, thoroughly engrossed, just like he would be listening to a scene from \"The Husband of a Young Stage Actress.\"\n[1898-01-27 09:40:32] Opera House | I thought this opera lacked the poetry and profound insight that Steven was familiar with, and Steven had imagined that Mélac was fully capable of filling his play with poetry and profound insight.\n[1898-01-27 09:40:37] Opera House | I thought, but Steven believed that without these things, it was all the more elegant—a traditional elegance, and therefore even more mysterious and enlightening to people.\n[1898-01-28 16:14:38] Opera House | I saw Steven's neighbor, who pretended to be in the know, saying that he hadn't heard the name being whispered about behind him. I heard, \"That fat man is the Marquis de Fairhaven.\"\n[1898-01-28 16:14:43] Opera House | I saw Count de Barrack stretch his neck, turn his face sideways, and his round, bulging eyes, fixed on the lens of his monocle, slowly moved in the transparent darkness.\n[1898-01-28 16:14:58] Opera House | I saw him as if he were oblivious to the audience in the hall, like a fish in a glass aquarium, swimming back and forth without acknowledging the curious visitors who had come to see him.\n[1898-01-28 16:15:13] Opera House | When I saw him, he would sometimes stop in his tracks, covered in moss, breathing heavily, and it was awe-inspiring; yet the audience couldn't tell if he was all right, if he was sleeping, or moving, or spawning, or barely breathing.\n[1898-01-28 16:15:28] Opera House | I thought how jealous Steven was of him, no one had ever made Steven feel such envy: because Steven immediately knew that he was a regular in the compartment, and when the princess lady offered him sugar, he remained cold and indifferent.\n[1898-01-28 16:15:33] Opera House | I saw that the princess looked at him with her beautiful eyes, which seemed to be carved from diamonds. I thought that whenever she looked at someone like that, wisdom and friendship would turn her beautiful eyes into a pool of autumn water.",

But if the reflecting surface caused them to move slightly, they would burst forth with a vertical, inhumanly brilliant flame, turning the entire pool red.\n[1898-01-29 16:28:31] Opera House | I saw that the play \"Hedda\" featuring Arthur was about to start, and the princess's lady came walking toward the front row of the box.\n[1898-01-29 16:28:41] Opera House | At that moment, she seemed to appear like an actress entering the stage, and as she passed through different areas of light, Steven saw her jewelry not only change color but also transform in substance.\n[1898-01-29 16:28:46] Opera House | I saw the compartment dry up, reveal itself, no longer a world of the sea, and the princess was no longer a sea goddess.\n[1898-01-29 16:29:01] Opera House | I saw the blue and white turban on her head, which resembled the costume of an outstanding tragic actress from Zaire—or perhaps Orózema.\n[1898-01-29 16:29:16] Opera House | I saw her sit down in the first row. I saw Steven seeing the warm little kingfisher's nest, like a great bird from heaven, soft and fluffy, dazzling and tenderly protecting her pale pink face.\n[1898-01-29 16:29:26] Opera House | At that moment, a woman arrived, and Steven's gaze left the box of the Princess de Fairhaven and turned toward her.\n[1898-01-29 16:29:36] Opera House | I saw Steven notice that she was short, poorly dressed, and ugly, but with bright, penetrating eyes.\n[1898-01-29 16:29:51] Opera House | I saw her sit down a few paces away from Steven, along with the two young men accompanying her.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:01] Opera House | I saw that next, the curtain was drawn back. I thought how Steven, without any sorrow, had lost all his former affection for the art of theater and for Arthur.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:06] Opera House | I recalled that in order not to miss the chance to visit this extraordinary talent, who was worth tracking down across the world, Steven had been completely absorbed, fully concentrated, like an astronomer's sensitive instrument about to be installed in Africa and the Antilles for the precise observation of a comet or an eclipse.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:11] Opera House | I thought of Steven worrying that a dark cloud might appear, say, if the actors were not in good form or an accident occurred in the audience, preventing the performance from reaching its highest level.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:16] Opera House | I knew that if Steven had gone to the theater that was not the one she revered as a goddess. Whenever I think of Steven, I feel as though I'm watching the play under less than ideal conditions. Yet in that theater, Steven would think that those stage managers, who had been specifically named by her and wore white baby's breath flowers, the balcony above the orchestra section filled with poorly dressed audience members, the ushers selling programs featuring her photos in the lobby, and the chestnut trees in the center of the square—all these were still part of her entrance beneath the small red curtain, even if they were only secondary elements.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:21] Opera House | I thought they seemed to be inseparable companions and confidants of Steven's feelings at that time.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:26] Opera House | I thought that at that time, the scene in \"Hedda\" where love is revealed, as well as Arthur herself, were almost an absolute existence for Steven.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:31] Opera House | I thought of their life, so far removed from ordinary human experience, existing by itself through them; Steven had to get close to them, to understand them as deeply as he possibly could.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:36] Opera House | I thought, but Steven, with his eyes wide open and his soul receptive, could only absorb very little.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:41] Opera House | I thought how beautiful life must be to Steven! Steven's own life was, of course, insignificant, but that didn't matter—it was just like getting dressed and preparing to go out, a trivial matter.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:46] Opera House | I thought about how, in some more distant place, absolutely, there was \"Hedda\" along with Arthur's way of delivering her lines. These more solid realities are hard to approach and impossible to fully grasp.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:51] Opera House | I thought of Steven, who spent his days dreaming of a perfect dramatic art, like a battery constantly being recharged; if someone were to analyze Steven's thoughts at any moment during the day or night, they could draw out numerous samples from his dreams.\n[1898-01-29 16:30:56] Opera House | I thought that now, all of this had become a small mountain, which from afar seemed to merge with the blue sky, but up close was utterly ordinary. It had left the realm of the absolute and become indistinguishable from other things—those things in which Steven lived and which were familiar to Steven. The actors were no better than the people Steven knew.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:01] Opera House | I thought of them doing their best to recite lines from \"Hedyle,\" and these lines were no longer extraordinary, individual, or unique, but rather verses that had more or less succeeded, ready to return to the boundless material of French poetry, joining their ranks.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:06] Opera House | I thought that, especially because the things Steven had longed for no longer existed, Steven felt even more discouraged.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:11] Opera House | I thought, but Steven's nature of endlessly imagining around a single thing still remained, although it changed year by year, and would still sometimes lead Steven to act on impulse without considering the danger.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:16] Opera House | I recalled one evening when Steven, ill, went to a castle to see a painting by George and some medieval tapestries.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:21] Opera House | I thought of that evening when Steven and I were to set off for Oakdale, and how it was similar to the day when Steven went to see Arthur perform or left for Riverside. Steven foresaw that the things he was now sacrificing for would soon cease to interest him; Steven would be able to pass by this painting and these tapestries without even glancing at them, even though at that time Steven had often lain awake at night, suffering from unbearable pain, just for these tapestries.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:26] Opera House | I thought about the things Steven had sacrificed, which were unstable, and Steven sensed that his efforts were in vain. Steven's sacrifices were so great that he couldn't even believe them, just like those neurasthenic patients who, when reminded that they were tired, felt their fatigue double.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:31] Opera House | I thought that, at this moment, Steven's dream made everything connected to this dream seem intoxicating. Even in Steven's physical desires, in this always-directional, constantly focused desire surrounding the same dream, he could discern a dominant idea, one for which Steven would be willing to give his life. The core of this idea was perfection.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:36] Opera House | I thought back to earlier times, in Sunrise, when every afternoon, as Steven read in the garden, his dominant thought was also this perfection.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:41] Opera House | I no longer tolerate as readily as before whether Steven's tenderness or anger toward Alcide, Ismene, and Hippolytus in their dialogue and actions was appropriately expressed.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:46] Opera House | I was not thinking of the actors—still the same people—because they were less clever than before, unable to modulate their voices with the same tenderness and emotional depth, or deliberately remain ambiguous and vague; or to give their gestures a heavy tragic quality, or reveal the pain of a desperate plea.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:51] Opera House | I thought of their tones giving orders to the voice: \"You must be gentle, sing as a nightingale, soft and tender, enchanting.\" Or, on the contrary: \"You must now be furious.\" Then the tone would rush toward the voice, trying to conquer it by force.\n[1898-01-29 16:31:56] Opera House | I thought, but the voice struggled against it, stubbornly maintaining its natural sound as Steven was—Steven in his true form, unyielding and unchanged. Its material flaws and charm, its everyday crudeness or pretension remained exactly the same, displaying an entire set of acoustic or social phenomena, with no effect whatsoever on the emotions contained within the recited verse.\n[1898-01-29 16:32:01] Opera House | I thought, similarly, the actors' movements gave orders to their arms and sleeveless robes: \"You must be magnificent.\"\n[1898-01-29 16:32:06] Opera House | I thought, but my uncooperative upper limbs still allowed a biceps utterly ignorant of the character to swagger between my shoulder and elbow; they continued, as always, to enact the unremarkable routine of daily life, without revealing the delicate emotions in Racine's verses, but only showing the relationship between muscles; the wide, wrinkled ro be was lifted by them and then fell along the vertical direction, with only the uninteresting softness of the fabric competing with the law of free fall.",

    "text": "[1898-01-31 11:52:01] Opera House | I saw that at this very moment, the short-haired woman sitting next to Steven burst out shouting. I heard, \"Don't clap for her! Look at the strange way she's dressed! She's too old to act anymore. Anyone else would have been offstage long ago.\"\n[1898-01-31 11:52:06] Opera House | I saw the people around me making \"shhh\" sounds, and the two young men accompanying her tried to calm her down. She stopped shouting, but her eyes still burned with anger.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:16] Opera House | I knew that despite earning a lot of money, Arthur was deeply in debt. She would agree to business deals or go on dates with friends, but never follow through. Waiters in uniforms chased her down the streets to cancel the deals. She had booked rooms in hotels but never showed up. She ordered large quantities of perfume to bathe her dog but never picked them up. She also had to pay hefty penalties to various shop owners. I thought that this anger was only directed at success and honor.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:21] Opera House | I knew that even though she didn't spend as recklessly as Cleopatra, nor as extravagantly, she could still bankrupt several provinces, even entire kingdoms, just by riding in a luxurious carriage.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:26] Opera House | I know, but this short-tempered lady is an actress with bad luck. I thought of how she hated Arthur with all her heart.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:31] Opera House | I saw just now, Arthur made her entrance. I thought to myself, it's a miracle!\n[1898-01-31 11:52:36] Opera House | I thought about Arthur's talent. In the past, Steven had once been so consumed with trying to grasp its essence that he neglected sleep and food, but it always eluded him. Yet in recent years, Steven had stopped thinking about it, and now he had no interest in it at all. And yet, it easily won Steven's admiration.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:41] Opera House | I thought of how, just like those lessons, the boys at night would study desperately, exhausting themselves, yet failing to get them into their minds; but after a good night's sleep, they would remember everything. It was also like the faces of the dead, which the boys' memories would try desperately to recall, yet could never, but when they stopped thinking about them, those faces would suddenly appear vividly before them.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:46] Opera House | I thought back to how, in order to isolate and see Arthur's talent by itself, Steven had almost removed from his understanding of the character's traits all the common features of every actress who had played Phedra before him, so that what remained was only Madame Arthur's talent.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:51] Opera House | I thought that, however, this talent, although Steven tried to see it beyond the character, was inseparably fused with the character itself.\n[1898-01-31 11:52:56] Opera House | I thought of the case of the great musician (as with Vandeille when he played the piano), where the performance came from such a great pianist that the audience even forgot that the artist was a musician, because this kind of playing did not use a full set of techniques (yet the outstanding effects were everywhere visible), nor a series of flying notes (at least, those listeners who felt lost in clouds and mist believed they had discovered tangible, touchable talent). It became so transparent, so rich in meaning, that the audience no longer sensed its presence; it seemed like a window opening onto a masterpiece.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:01] Opera House | I thought about the voices and gestures of Alcide, Ismael, and Hippolyte, which seemed to form a solemn or delicate boundary surrounding me, yet Steven could still distinguish them.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:06] Opera House | I thought, but Chantal had internalized the meaning of her voice and gestures; Steven, struggling desperately, could not detect her intention from her tone or posture, nor could he catch their effect on the surface, which was too simple and consistent, because they were entirely merged within, without standing out.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:11] Opera House | I saw that in Arthur's voice, there was no longer any trace of lifeless or uncooperative residue; it did not reveal that there had been excess tears around it.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:16] Opera House | I thought that on the marble-like voice of Alcide or Ismère, one could see tears rolling down, because the tears had not been absorbed.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:21] Opera House | I thought of sound merging into the tiniest cells, becoming subtly soft, like a cellist's cello. When people praised its beautiful tone, they weren't commenting on its physical properties, but rather its noble soul.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:26] Opera House | I thought of it again as an ancient landscape painting, where a spring of still water lay in the place where the fairy had vanished. A distinct, concrete intention had turned into something with a musical quality, astonishingly clear, bright and cold.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:31] Opera House | I saw Arthur's voice carried away by the verses from her lips, and similarly, her arms seemed to be gently lifted to her chest by the verses, just like those leaves, pushed by the overflowing water to shift their positions.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:36] Opera House | I thought of her gradually formed and constantly improving stage presence, each detail carefully considered. The logic behind her every movement had a depth different from the vague reasoning behind other actors' movements.\n[1898-01-31 11:53:41] Opera House | I thought of her, no longer subject to the control of will, but rather merged into the rich and complex trembling radiance of the character Chantelle, such that the enraptured audience did not see it as an achievement of the artist, but rather as a fact of life.\n[1898-02-01 13:23:29] Opera House | I saw those white veils, exhausted and faithful, as if they were living substances, woven from a painful mixture of half-pagan and half-Prussian sentiments, like a delicate and cold-sensitive cocoon, contracting around that pain.\n[1898-02-01 13:23:44] Opera House | I thought of all this—voice, grace, movement, veils—encircling a single idea, a line of poetry, surrounding this body, which was different from the human body, not an opaque, obstructive substance, but a pure, transcendent garment.\n[1898-02-01 13:23:49] Opera House | I thought of them as mere added coverings, which not only failed to conceal the soul, but actually made it even more radiant, and the soul absorbed them and radiated through them.\n[1898-02-01 13:23:54] Opera House | I thought of them as lava flows of semi-transparent material, layer upon layer, which refracted the central beam of light that passed through them, making it shine more splendidly with each layer, and spreading out the fiery, permeated substance surrounding the light beam even more widely, making it more precious and beautiful.\n[1898-02-01 13:23:59] Opera House | I thought this was Arthur's interpretation of the work. Her genius gave the work life and created a second work.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:04] Opera House | I thought to myself that Steven's impression of Arthur this time, although better than before, was nothing really different.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:09] Opera House | I thought that Steven was simply no longer comparing his own impressions with the abstract and mistaken preconceptions he had in his mind about dramatic genius. Steven believed that dramatic genius was precisely this unbiased way of seeing things.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:14] Opera House | I thought about how Steven had not enjoyed the play of Arthur the first time he heard her, because he had placed too much hope in her, just like when Steven used to go to the Champs-Élysées to see his lover Michael, because his passion and desire for her had been too strong, leading to disappointment instead.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:19] Opera House | I thought that between these two disappointments, besides the similarity of having high expectations, there might be another, and more profound, common element.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:24] Opera House | I thought that if a person, or a work (or its performance), has a distinctive and unique personality, people's impressions of it would also be particularly strong.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:29] Opera House | I thought that in the minds of Stevens, concepts such as \"beauty,\" \"rich style,\" and \"touching melancholy\" had already been formed. When necessary, Stevens could imagine these qualities in an artist's ordinary performance, even on a face that was otherwise unremarkable.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:34] Opera House | I thought of it, but before the concentrated minds of the Stevenes, a form kept flickering, something not yet equivalent to anything in their thoughts; this unknown thing had to emerge.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:39] Opera House | I thought of Steven's mind hearing a sharp sound, a peculiar tone of inquiry. It asked itself: \"Is this beauty? Is what Steven feels a compliment? Is it not brilliant color, refined and grand style?\"\n[1898-02-01 13:24:44] Opera House | I thought of how I could once again answer it, and it was still a sharp voice, a peculiar tone of questioning, an impression of a stranger who did not allow for any discussion, a completely material impression, leaving no room at all for \"performance.\"\n[1898-02-01 13:24:49] Opera House | I thought that precisely because of this, it was exactly those truly beautiful works that made Steven more and more disappointed the more seriously he listened, because in the minds of Stevenes, there was still no idea that matched this particular impression.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:54] Opera House | I thought this was exactly what Arthur's performance had shown Steven. The style of the recitation was elegant and skillful. Exactly like that.\n[1898-02-01 13:24:59] Opera House | I thought that now Steven understood the value of a performance that was rich, vigorous, and transcendent. More accurately, it is precisely these names that one must assign to such performances; yet this is like naming some constellations without any mythological significance as Mars, Venus, and Saturn.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:04] Opera House | I thought of the Stevenes who feel in one world and think and name in another; the Stevenes can reconcile these two worlds, but cannot bring them any closer together.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:09] Opera House | I thought of the day Steven first went to see Arthur perform, the very same distance and chasm that had to be crossed; Steven listened intently, yet he could not reconcile this with his mind's notion of \"refined performance\" and \"unique style.\"\n[1898-02-01 13:25:14] Opera House | I saw Steven hesitate for a moment before clapping for her. I thought the applause seemed not to come from Steven's impression, but rather from some pre-existing idea in Steven's mind, because Steven had finally heard Arthur act.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:19] Opera House | I thought about the distance that exists between an extremely individual person or an exceptionally distinctive work and the idea of beauty, and this same distance also exists between the impression left by this person or work on Stevenes and the pre-existing notions of love and admiration in their minds; therefore, the Stevenes do not acknowledge it.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:24] Opera House | I thought of Steven, who, when watching Arthur perform, felt no joy—just as he felt no pleasure when visiting his lover Michael in her passion—so Steven muttered to himself, \"So, Steven doesn't really appreciate her.\"\n[1898-02-01 13:25:29] Opera House | I thought back to that time when Steven had devoted himself entirely to studying the actress's performance, never tiring of it, and had made a conscious effort to open his mind as much as possible to absorb all the meaning contained in her acting. Now Steven understood that this very act was itself an appreciation of her.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:34] Opera House | Was the talent displayed in Arthur's performance merely that of Racine? At first, Steven thought so.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:39] Opera House | I saw that the first act of *Chérubin* had just ended, and after the actors had taken their bows several times in response to the audience's applause, Steven regained consciousness.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:44] Opera House | I saw that, because of the actress's curtain call, the irritable lady beside Steven leaned sideways, straightened her frail upper body, tightened her facial muscles, and crossed her arms over her chest. I thought of showing her disdain for clapping along with everyone else, in order to draw more attention to her protest.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:49] Opera House | I thought she had expected a strong reaction, but no one saw it.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:54] Opera House | I knew the next play was a new one. I recalled that, in the past, because the new plays were unknown, Steven always found them thin and strange, and they ceased to exist outside the stage.\n[1898-02-01 13:25:59] Opera House | I thought that this time Steven did not feel the vitality of this masterpiece as a mere incidental performance, existing only on stage, only for a brief run. Steven also did not feel bored or disappointed.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:04] Opera House | I thought to myself, Steven felt, that the long monologues in the new play were greatly appreciated by the audience; although they had never been supported before and remained unknown, they would one day become famous, provided the actors made the opposite effort, not treating the play as an unproven work, but instead giving it their all, regarding the new play as a masterpiece that would one day be mentioned alongside the author's other celebrated works. In that case, they would succeed.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:09] Opera House | I thought that, perhaps one day, this role played by Arthur might be included among her most successful performances, standing side by side with that of Hyppolite. It wasn't because the role itself had literary value, but rather because Arthur's acting was so extraordinary, as in the play \"Hyppolite,\" bringing the character to life with such vivid realism.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:14] Opera House | I suddenly understood. The author's tragic work was nothing more than the raw material for the tragic actor to create a masterpiece of performance, a trivial and insignificant material.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:19] Opera House | I thought this was very similar to the situation with George, the great painter Steven met in Riverside, who found two equally valuable subjects for his paintings in an unremarkable school and a cathedral that was itself a masterpiece.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:24] Opera House | I thought of how the painter dissolves houses, freight wagons, and figures into the grand effect of light, thus making them harmonious. Similarly, Arthur seemed to spread out a huge canvas, painting an immense fear and tenderness. The lines she recited, whether refined or plain, all blended together. A talentless actor would have surely read them in a halting, disjointed manner.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:29] Opera House | I thought, of course, that each person has their own rhythm and tone, and Arthur's intonation did not prevent Steven and others from feeling the presence of the poetry.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:34] Opera House | I thought about how when Stevens hear a rhyme, something that is both the same as and not entirely the same as the previous one, something that is constrained by the earlier rhyme but also introduces a new idea, they feel there are two overlapping systems—one of thought, the other of rhythm—and isn't this overlapping system itself already a complex order, isn't it the primary element of beauty?\n[1898-02-01 13:26:39] Opera House | I thought that, by incorporating words, poems, even \"monologues\" into larger systems, Arthur made them linger at the edges of these systems, and the Stevenes would be enchanted; just as a poet, when choosing words, first considers the rhyme, and a musician, when writing lyrics, must fit each line into the same melody, both restraining and propelling them.",

    "text": "[1898-02-01 13:26:44] Opera House | I thought that, therefore, Arthur was able to blend the grand images of suffering, elegance, and passion into the dialogue of modern drama, just as she did into the verses of Racine, and these images were precisely her unique creations, instantly recognizable as her work, just like one can tell that a portrait painted by the same artist, even if it is based on different models.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:49] Opera House | I thought of Steven, no longer hoping that Arthur's posture would remain motionless, no longer hoping that the beautiful and fleeting, irreplaceable color effects produced by the brief illumination would last forever, and no longer hoping that she would repeat a poem a hundred times.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:54] Opera House | I thought that Steven had finally understood that he had set too high expectations and been too strict, exceeding the willingness of the poet, the actress, and her director and set designer.\n[1898-02-01 13:26:59] Opera House | I thought of the kind of charm that spreads quickly over a line of poetry, of those unpredictable postures and one scene after another, which are the instantaneous effects that dramatic art strives to achieve--fleeting goals, ever-changing masterpieces. Yet an audience too absorbed in the work always wants to make these fleeting effects remain motionless, thereby destroying exactly that effect.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:04] Opera House | I thought that Steven no longer even wanted to see Arthur perform, for he was already satisfied with her.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:09] Opera House | I thought back to the past, and because Steven had placed such great hopes on the object of his praise—whether it was Michael or Arthur—he was always disappointed. As a result, Steven would hope for a pleasant impression the next day because he had not been satisfied the day before.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:14] Opera House | I thought that this time Steven felt happy, but he didn't want to savor it too much; if Steven had wanted to, he might have experienced it more deeply.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:19] Opera House | I heard Steven mutter to himself, just like a classmate of his from middle school would: \"The throne of the champion, Steven believes, belongs to Arthur!\" I thought, but Steven vaguely felt that although Steven had expressed his admiration, giving the title of champion to Arthur, Steven's inner peace was thus achieved, but this did not accurately convey Arthur's extraordinary talent.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:24] Flandres Hotel | I saw that Steven would have to go to a hotel the next day. I thought about how it would be sad to know that Steven was already there before I arrived, this sad feeling was like a suffocating fragrance, which had emanated from any new room, in other words, from any room, since Steven's birth, a scent that made Steven feel breathless.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:29] Flandres Hotel | I thought of the room where Steven usually lived, and yet Steven seemed to be absent from it. Steven's thoughts were elsewhere, and only habit took the place of real thinking.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:34] Flandres Hotel | I thought that, once we arrived at a new place, Steven would no longer be able to get used to it—the maid, who was less sensitive than Steven—would not take care of Steven's clothes, because Steven had arrived earlier, all alone, and had to come into contact with the things of this new place by himself.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:39] Flandres Hotel | I thought of this \"Steven,\" who I only found again every few years, but he never changed. Since Steven left Sunrise, since his first visit to Riverside, he had never grown up; he remained crying uncontrollably beside a messy trunk.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:44] Flandres Hotel | I saw that the ancient building still retained its lavishness, overflowing to the brim. I thought, but Steven was wrong, Steven didn't have time to worry, because Steven couldn't be alone for even a minute.\n[1898-02-01 13:27:49] Flandres Hotel | I thought that Steven would have found such extreme luxury out of place in a modern hotel, but here it didn't seem the least bit forced; instead, it revealed a vitality even in idleness.\n[1898-02-03 21:33:13] Flandres Hotel | I saw that people could meet at any time. I saw the corridor winding aimlessly, meandering back and forth; the front hall of the guest room was long like a corridor, decorated as elegantly as a parlor, and it seemed less like part of the hotel than like a guest of the hotel.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:01] Flandres Hotel | When I saw Steven arrive, they came to keep him company. I saw that they were not confined within a set of individual rooms, but instead lingered around Steven's room.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:11] Flandres Hotel | I thought of them as something like the little ghosts of an old era, idle but silent, left to linger at the doors of rented rooms. Whenever Steven met them on the road, they always showed their quiet affection for him.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:16] Flandres Hotel | I thought that, in any case, the general idea of a house— if a house were merely a place for Steven's everyday life, a shelter from the cold and a barrier against outsiders— would be utterly unsuitable for this house.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:21] Flandres Hotel | I saw people returning from outside, inevitably coming across them, either avoiding them or greeting them warmly. I thought of this, and each room became as real as a person, though they were silent.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:26] Flandres Hotel | I saw the large drawing room lying quietly there, people tried not to disturb it, and every time we saw it, we showed it our respect. I saw that the grand drawing room had been accustomed, since the eighteenth century, to its dim yellow walls and colorful ceiling.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:36] Flandres Hotel | I saw them in such vast numbers that they were beyond counting, like a group of deserters, heedless of whether they were symmetrical or neat, fleeing from the big drawing room in all directions, panicking and scattering in disorder, until they reached the garden, crossed three dilapidated steps, and disappeared smoothly into the garden. I thought of those small rooms, which made Steven feel more familiar and curious.\n[1898-02-04 23:43:41] Flandres Hotel | I saw that if Steven wanted to go to his room without taking the elevator or being seen on the main staircase, a narrower, abandoned service stairway would offer him its steps. I saw the steps, one after another, arranged skillfully above and below.\n[1898-02-06 01:53:18] Flandres Hotel | I thought of how they seemed to release a perfect harmony as they progressed, the kind of harmony that Stevens can feel in colors, scents, and flavors, which often arouse an infinite pleasure for Stevens.\n[1898-02-06 01:53:23] Flandres Hotel | I thought, but the sensual pleasure of climbing stairs was something Steven only felt upon arriving here, as before, but it was only in the Alps that Steven realized the seemingly unremarkable act of breathing could give a sense of eternal delight.\n[1898-02-06 01:53:28] Flandres Hotel | I saw Steven climbing these stairs for the first time and felt it was very easy for him (usually, it is only when one is used to something that it becomes effortless). I thought that, as if the things had already been familiar with Steven before he knew them, as if they had given Steven the sense of comfort that only habit could produce.\n[1898-02-06 01:53:33] Flandres Hotel | I thought that Steven had not yet developed the habit, and once he did, the power of the habit would weaken for him, perhaps because the former master, who used to greet and see off the dogs every day, had woven that sense of comfort into their very being.\n[1898-02-06 07:59:30] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven open a room, and the double doors closed behind him. I saw the pleated curtains bringing a sense of stillness. I thought, but Steven felt as if he had become king, overwhelmed with ecstasy.\n[1898-02-06 07:59:35] Marcel's Room | I saw a low chair set out for Steven to sit by the fire and keep warm, and Steven was as comfortable as if he were sitting on the carpet. I saw a marble fireplace adorned with bronze sculptures — it would be a great mistake to think it represented only the art of the Directory — was burning for Steven.\n[1898-02-06 07:59:40] Marcel's Room | I saw the walls tightly embracing the room, isolating it from the outside world; there were wardrobes on the walls to store things inside; and a space was left for the bed, which was supported by a few slender columns at either side, gently holding up the elevated ceiling above the headboard.\n[1898-02-06 07:59:45] Marcel's Room | I saw that in the large room there were two small rooms, as wide as the main room, and in the back one, a string of prayer beads made from the roots of blue violets was hanging on the wall. I thought of this string of beads that gives pleasure, adding a pleasant fragrance for those who come here to calm their minds and rest their bodies.\n[1898-02-06 07:59:50] Marcel's Room | I saw that if Steven slipped into this small room, he would leave all the doors open. Whenever I thought about it, the small room would suddenly expand three times its size without ruining its sense of harmony. It would not only give Steven the pleasure of feeling things compressed, then expanded, but also add a sense of freedom to his inviolable, yet no longer enclosed and quiet pleasure.\n[1898-02-06 07:59:55] Marcel's Room | I saw that the small room's window opened onto a courtyard. I thought of her as a lonely beauty seen from above.\n[1898-02-06 08:00:00] Marcel's Room | I saw that the next morning, Steven discovered that the courtyard was sealed off by high walls with no windows around it. I saw only two tall, withered trees in the courtyard, but they were enough to add a soft violet hue to the cloudless blue sky. I thought how lucky it was that Steven had this lonely beauty as a neighbor.",

    "text": "[1898-02-07 23:00:00] Corridor of the Hôtel de Flandres | I saw before going to sleep, Steven left the room, wanting to conduct a thorough exploration of Steven's remarkable domain.\n[1898-02-07 23:00:05] Hallway of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw Steven walking down a long corridor, which one by one revealed its treasures to him. I thought that as long as Steven was not sleepy, it would be willing to offer all its treasures to Steven.\n[1898-02-07 23:00:20] Corridor of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw an armchair in the corner, an old piano, a blue earthenware vase filled with cyclamens mounted on a narrow shelf with curling legs on the wall, and a ghostly image of an ancient woman framed in an old picture frame, her powdered hair adorned with a few blue flowers, holding a bouquet of carnations.\n[1898-02-07 23:00:25] Hallway of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw Steven come to the end of the corridor. I thought of a wall without doors and earnestly said to Steven, \"It's time to go back, but you see, this is your home.\"\n[1898-02-07 23:00:30] Flandres Hotel Corridor | I thought, but the soft carpet, in gratitude for the favor, told Steven that if he didn't sleep at night, he could certainly come barefoot, and the few windows facing the countryside, without shutters, assured Steven they would stay awake all night, so he never had to worry about disturbing them, no matter when he came.\n[1898-02-07 23:00:40] Corridor of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw that behind a curtain, Steven discovered a small room blocked off by a wall, with no way to escape. I thought of Steven, who felt nervous and hidden there, anxiously staring with his oxen's eyes, pale as leeks under the moonlight, at Steven.\n[1898-02-08 06:29:35] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven go to bed. I thought that the down comforter, the small column, and the little stove kept Steven's attention in a state completely different from when he was in Willowbrook, preventing him from indulging in his usual habit of daydreaming.\n[1898-02-08 06:29:40] Marcel's Room | I thought about this special state of attention surrounding sleep, which affected and altered sleep, linking it directly to a series of memories belonging to Steven. Therefore, the images that filled Steven's first night's dream could not be connected to the series of memories he normally encountered during his sleep.\n[1898-02-08 06:29:45] Marcel's Room | When I was asleep, Steven tried to pull himself back into the series of memories he was accustomed to. I thought about it, but the bed that Steven had not yet gotten used to and the attention required when turning over to maintain a comfortable sleeping position would come into play, correcting or maintaining Steven's new train of thought as he dreamed.\n[1898-02-08 06:29:50] Hall of Thought | I thought that sleep, like Steven's perception of the external world, was subject to the same principle. If only Steven's habits were slightly altered, everything could become filled with poetic charm. For instance, if he fell asleep still fully dressed, the depth of his sleep would change, and its beauty would be easier to appreciate.\n[1898-02-08 06:29:55] Marcel's Room | I saw the Stevenes wake up, check their watches, and think it was four o'clock, but it was actually only four in the morning. I thought that Steven and the others would believe I had slept all day, because in their eyes, this brief sleep was full and solid, like the golden ball of an emperor, granted to Steven by some supreme authority.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:00] Marcel's room | I saw that the next morning, Steven was dreaming that his grandfather had everything ready and was waiting for Steven to go with him to Mass at the church of Méséglise. I thought Steven was feeling terribly troubled, but just then the military band of the cavalry woke him up. This cavalry unit passed by Steven's window every day.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:05] Marcel's Room | I thought, and there were two or three times when—Steven was not wrong, because human life is immersed in sleep, and sleep, night after night, surrounds life like the sea surrounding a peninsula. If the Stevenes did not immerse life in sleep, they would never be able to depict it fully—Steven slept so soundly that even the military band's loud music could not wake him up.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:10] Marcel's Room | Sometimes, Steven would be briefly awakened by the music of science, but his consciousness, just emerging from sleep, was still hazy. I thought of the sharp flute's sound as nothing more than a gentle caress on Steven's consciousness, like the soft and fresh murmur of a morning bird. This phenomenon was like an organ that had been numbed beforehand; the pain wasn't immediately noticeable, only becoming apparent in the end, like the ache from a slight burn.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:15] Marcel's room | I saw that before the dragoons had all passed by Steven's window, sleep had already taken the last few blossoms of the bouquet of sounds, and Steven sank back into sleep.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:20] Marcel's Room | I thought about how the part of Steven's consciousness that came into contact with this bouquet of sounds was so small, and how deeply it had been deceived by sleep. Later, when Peter asked Steven if he had heard the music, Steven even began to doubt whether the military band's sound had been real or just something he imagined; it was like during the day, whenever he caught the faintest hint of a sound in the air, he would immediately think it was the sound of a military band.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:25] Marcel's Room | I thought perhaps Steven had heard the voice in a dream, afraid of being awakened, or on the contrary, afraid of not waking up, of never seeing the hussar column again.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:30] Marcel's Room | I thought that because such things often happened, Steven had been startled awake by a sound, but actually Steven was still sleeping soundly. For the next hour, Steven remained in a daze, half-awake, half-asleep. On the white curtain of sleep, Steven would stage all sorts of shadow plays for himself. Sleep tried desperately to hold back, but Steven kept having hallucinations of long, thin shadows.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:35] Hall of Thought | I thought, indeed, that sometimes what we do during the day can only be completed in a dream when sleep comes. In other words, one must first pass through a drowsy phase that shifts direction, following a path entirely different from the one Steven and others take when they are awake.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:40] Hall of Thought | I thought of the same thing having two different outcomes. Nevertheless, the world in which Steven's sleep-life exists is so different from the real world that insomniacs first think of escaping from the real world.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:45] Hall of Thought | I thought about how they would keep their eyes shut for hours, their minds filled with the same thoughts they had when their eyes were open. As soon as they noticed that an unusual thought had appeared in the first minute, a thought that on the surface seemed to contradict the laws of logic and real life, they would regain their courage.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:50] Hall of Thought | I thought this brief \"trance\" indicated that the door to sleep had already opened, and perhaps they could now slip through it, leaving behind the sense of reality and taking a rest in a place somewhat removed from it. In this way, they would then be able to sleep soundly for a while, either long or short.\n[1898-02-08 06:30:55] Hall of Thought | I thought, but when the Stevenes turned their backs on reality and approached the next few dangerous places, the Stevenes had made a big step forward.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:00] Hall of Thought | I thought of those dangerous places, where \"Steven's hint\" was like a witch, preparing terrible food that made Stevens imagine all sorts of illnesses, or caused a relapse of neuroses, and was watching closely as the illness violently broke out in unconscious sleep, in order to disturb the sleep.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:05] The Hall of Thought | I thought of the garden not far away, where no one was allowed to enter. Various different sleepings, like some flowers, grew there unnoticed: mandrake, hemp, various ether essences, belladonna, opium, and valerian.",

    "text": "[1898-02-08 06:31:10] Hall of Thought | I thought of these sleeping flowers that would not bloom until the fateful stranger came to touch them, and then they would open into remarkably beautiful blossoms, releasing a series of dreams onto the sleeper for several hours, their intense fragrance astonishing and overwhelming.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:15] Hall of Thought | I thought of the monastery deep in the garden, with all its windows open, echoing constantly with the lessons that Stevenes recited before falling asleep, which could only be memorized upon awakening.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:20] Hall of Thought | As I thought this, the clock inside Steven's mind ticked nonstop (this was a sign of awakening), and the alarm was infallible because Steven had something to worry about. When the housewife came to inform Steven that it was seven o'clock, she found him already awake.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:25] Hall of Thought | I thought of this room, which had opened its doors to sleep, where sleep worked tirelessly, making people forget the sorrows of love. Sometimes, this work was interrupted by a nightmare filled with vague memories, but it soon resumed again.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:30] Hall of Thought | I thought of Stevens waking up, still carrying the memory of their dreams hanging on the dark walls of the room, but these memories remained shrouded in darkness, often only becoming visible for the first time in the afternoon when a similar impression cast light upon them.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:35] Hall of Thought | I thought of several that had become unrecognizable, even though they were so clear in my dreams. When the Stevenes failed to recognize them, they had to be quickly buried in the earth, like the objects placed beside decaying corpses or remains, items so severely damaged that even the most skilled restorers could not restore them to use.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:40] Hall of Thought | I thought of the mining site by the fence, where the deep sleep came to soak the mind in some kind of coating. This coating was incredibly hard; if a sleeper's will wanted to wake the sleeper, even on a beautiful morning like gold, it would have to swing its axe like young Siegfried, hacking away fiercely.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:45] Hall of Thought | I thought of the world of nightmares that still lay behind me. Foolish doctors insisted that nightmares were more exhausting than insomnia. In fact, the opposite was true; they helped those who loved to reflect to divert their thoughts.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:50] Hall of Thought | I thought that nightmares would present Steven's like a series of bizarre picture books, such as the case where Steven's deceased parents had just been involved in a serious car accident, though there was still a possibility they might recover soon. While waiting for their recovery, the Stevenes would confine them in a small mouse cage, making them smaller than white mice, covered with large red blisters, and with a feather sticking out of their heads, imitating Cicero delivering a magnificent speech to the Stevenes.\n[1898-02-08 06:31:55] Hall of Thought | I thought of the turntable next to this album. Because of this turntable, Stevenes would temporarily face troubles, and would have to return to a house that had collapsed fifty years ago. However, as sleep faded away, the image of this house gradually disappeared, replaced by several different images. When the turntable finally stopped spinning, the final image would perfectly match the one Steven saw when he opened his eyes.\n[1898-02-08 06:32:00] Marcel's Room | I sometimes saw Steven hear nothing, because Steven was deep in a sleep so profound it felt like an abyss. I was delighted that Steven had managed to escape soon after, but Steven's head felt heavy and full of things, as if he had to digest everything that those flexible vegetative nervous systems—those nymphs like the ones who fed Hercules—had given him when he was asleep, multiplying their activity.\n[1898-02-08 06:32:05] Hall of Thought | I thought of how the Stevenes called this sleep \"lead sleep,\" that is, a deep sleep, because after such a sleep ended, even after a long time, the Stevenes would still feel their bodies heavy and lifeless, like lead. The Stevenes were no longer living people.\n[1898-02-08 06:32:10] Hall of Thought | I thought, but why is it that when Stevenes search for their thoughts and personalities as if looking for lost objects, they always end up finding \"Steven\" and no one else? Why, when Stevenes start thinking again, is the personality that emerges still the same as before? The Stevenes don't realize what is governing this choice—why, among thousands of possible candidates, it's always yesterday's \"Steven\" that is chosen.\n[1898-02-08 06:32:15] Hall of Thought | I wondered what was guiding the Stevenes when thought was truly blocked (either by sleeping until morning or by dreaming about something completely different from the impressions of waking consciousness). There had indeed been death, for example, when the heart stopped beating and the rhythmic tongue movement revived the Stevenes.\n[1898-02-08 06:32:20] Hall of Thought | I thought of a room, which, even if Steven had seen it only once, might awaken his memories, and upon these memories there would hang still older memories; or perhaps some of them would be buried deep in Steven's mind, without his being aware of them. Through the beneficial soul-flight of sleep, the scene at awakening should actually be similar to the moment when Steven recalls a forgotten name, a verse, or a chorus. If we consider the resurrection of the soul as a peculiar phenomenon of memory, it might perhaps be understandable.\n[1898-02-14 06:59:45] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven wake up. The bright, sunny sky was urging Steven to get up. I saw it, but the bright, crisp morning of early winter was chilly, making Steven reluctant to leave his bed.\n[1898-02-14 06:59:50] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven lift his head, stretch his neck, part of his body still hidden under the blankets. Steven stared wide-eyed out the window at the trees. I saw the leaves, for once unlike their usual appearance, as a few patches of color painted on an invisible canvas, golden and brilliantly red, hanging in the air.\n[1898-02-14 06:59:55] Marcel's Room | I thought of Steven like a chrysalis undergoing metamorphosis, possessing a duality, where one environment was hard to adapt to the various parts of Steven's body: Steven's vision required only color, not warmth, while his chest, on the contrary, needed only warmth, not color.\n[1898-02-14 07:00:00] Marcel's Room | I didn't get up until Steven had lit the fire. I saw the golden and purple morning as a clear and pleasing picture.\n[1898-02-14 07:00:05] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven staring at the morning scene painting. A moment ago, Steven had stirred the fire, artificially adding a warmth that the cold picture lacked. I thought of fire as a pipe, burning cheerfully, smoking, and giving Steven a coarse yet subtle pleasure. It was coarse because the pleasure was based on physical comfort, and subtle because it stirred in Steven a vague and pure fantasy.\n[1898-02-14 07:00:10] Marcel's Room | I saw a glaring red paper pasted in Steven's bathroom, covered with black and white flowers. I thought Steven's eyes would have difficulty adjusting. But these flowers kept appearing before Steven in new forms, forcing Steven to engage with them rather than resist, and changing the cheerful, song-filled atmosphere that greeted Steven when he woke up; these flowers forced Steven to stand in the midst of a sea of red, looking at this new residence, a world different from Willowbrook.\n[1898-02-14 07:00:15] Marcel's Room | I saw this new residence as a pleasant screen, with fresh air constantly flowing in, completely different in orientation from Steven's parents' house.\n[1898-02-14 07:00:20] Marcel's Room | I thought about how Steven had been restless for days, or longed to see his grandmother, fearing she might be ill at home, or else remembering some unfinished work he'd left in Willowbrook, which wasn't going well at the moment. (Even here, sometimes Steven had a way of deliberately making things difficult for himself.)\n[1898-02-14 07:00:25] Marcel's Room | I thought of these worries, one after another would arise to disturb Steven's sleep. Steven was powerless to dispel Steven's sorrow, and Steven felt that in an instant, the entire course of Steven's life was shrouded in gloom.\n[1898-02-16 06:13:47] Marcel's Room | I saw that Steven had someone from the hotel go to the barracks to deliver a message to Peter, telling him that if possible—Steven knew it was very difficult— he hoped he would come visit Steven.\n[1898-02-16 06:13:57] Marcel's Room | I saw that he arrived an hour later. As soon as the doorbell rang, Steven felt all his worries instantly vanish. I thought that Steven knew, and that worry was a strength before Steven, but a weakness before Peter.\n[1898-02-16 06:14:02] Marcel's Room | I thought that once he arrived, Steven's attention would leave behind Steven's worries and turn to him, expecting him to make a decision.\n[1898-02-16 06:14:07] Marcel's Room | I saw him come in, and immediately he brought the energy he had fully displayed that morning into Steven's surroundings, creating a lively atmosphere completely different from the mood of Steven's room. I thought how Steven quickly adapted to the new environment and responded appropriately.",

    "text": "[1898-02-18 20:41:23] Marcel's room | \"I heard, 'I'm sorry to disturb you. Steven is in a terrible mood, as you probably guessed.'\"\n[1898-02-18 20:41:28] Marcel's Room | \"I heard, 'No, Steven thought you wanted to see Steven, and Steven felt that was fine. You sent for Steven, and Steven is happy. What's wrong? What's the matter? What can Steven do for you?'\"\n[1898-02-20 03:55:11] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven openly express his inner worries to him. He listened and answered Steven's questions frankly. I thought that he had already made Steven into the same person as himself before he even spoke.\n[1898-02-20 03:55:16] Marcel's Room | I thought about how his heavy workload made him rush all day, with an active mind and a cheerful mood. Steven felt the same way; the troubles that had disturbed Steven's mind just now were really insignificant compared to his heavy workload.\n[1898-02-20 03:55:21] Marcel's Room | I thought of Steven like a sick person who had been unable to open his eyes for several days. They called in a doctor, who gently and skillfully opened the patient's eyelids and removed a grain of sand from within. The patient recovered and his mind was at peace.\n[1898-02-20 03:55:26] Marcel's Room | I saw all of Steven's troubles reduced to a telegram, and Peter volunteered to send it. I thought of Steven, as if he had found life entirely transformed, made so beautiful that he felt filled with strength, truly wanting to do something.\n[1898-02-22 02:45:57] Marcel's Room | I heard \"What are you doing now?\" Steven asked Peter.\n[1898-02-22 02:46:02] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"Steven is leaving right away; the unit is going to drill in fifteen minutes, and Steven has to go.\"\n[1898-02-22 02:46:07] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"Did I trouble you by asking you to come?\"\n[1898-02-22 02:46:12] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"There's nothing difficult about it. The captain was very polite. He said since it's you who called Steven, he should come, but Steven didn't want to stay long.\"\n[1898-02-22 02:46:17] Marcel's Room | I heard, \"If Steven would just get up quickly and go to the place where you're exercising, he'd find it very interesting. Perhaps during your rest time, he could even have a few words with you.\"\n[1898-02-22 02:46:22] Marcel's Room | \"I heard Steven say, 'Please don't act like this. You haven't slept all night over a trivial matter (it's really trivial, Steven assures you!). Now that you've just calmed down, go back to bed and get some good rest—it's very good for your health. Your nerve cells have released too much inorganic salt. Don't fall asleep right away, because the annoying military band will be passing by your window again. But Steven thinks, after the music is over, you'll be quiet again. See you at dinner.'\"\n[1898-02-26 22:59:55] Parade Ground | I saw it, but not for long. Soon Steven became interested in military theory (Peter's friends often talked about it at dinner), and so Steven began to frequently attend the cavalry exercises. I thought of Steven, whose mind was constantly occupied with the desire to take a close look at their various superiors, just as those who make music their main study and live all day in concert halls would eagerly frequent cafés and immerse themselves in the lives of musicians.\n[1898-02-26 23:00:00] Flandres Hotel | I had to walk a long way to the drill field, and Steven was so tired after dinner that he wanted to go to sleep immediately. His head felt dizzy, and he swayed unsteadily now and then.\n[1898-02-26 23:00:10] Flandres Hotel | I saw that the next day, Steven found out that Steven had not heard the military band. I knew it was the same in Riverside; every time Peter took Steven to Springfield for dinner, the next day there would be no music from the beach.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:00] Flandres Hotel | When I saw Steven trying to get up, I felt unable to move — it was a very comfortable feeling. I thought of Steven as if he were tightly bound by muscular and nourishing lateral roots to some deep, invisible land, and his fatigue had made his joints unusually sensitive.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:05] Flandres Hotel | I thought of Steven, who felt he had endless energy, and the road ahead seemed longer because Steven had once again returned to his childhood in Sunrise. Every time Steven and his friends went for a walk on the edge of Fairhaven village, the next day Steven would be too tired to get out of bed.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:10] Hall of Thought | I thought about how poets always say that when a Steven returns to the house or garden where he once lived as a child, he instantly recovers the past Stevenes. Such return to old places depends entirely on luck, with equal chances of disappointment and success. Places that have experienced different periods of time are best searched for within the Stevenes themselves.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:15] The Hall of Thought | I thought that, therefore, extreme fatigue combined with a night's sleep would to some extent help Steven and his kind to recover the past days of Steven.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:20] Hall of Thought | I thought of fatigue, which tirelessly dug into the depths of Steven's body, the deepest tunnels where the last flicker of yesterday's memory, the faint light of recollection, could no longer illuminate the inner monologue, even if the monologue itself did not wish to cease. It diligently excavated the soil and strata of Steven's body, causing his muscles to insert and twist their lateral roots, and to draw in new life, so that Steven might rediscover the garden where he had played as a child.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:25] Hall of Thought | I realized that there was no need to travel far to find this garden; instead, I should go deep underground. What once covered the earth no longer lay upon its surface, but beneath it; just traveling long distances was not enough to visit the ruins of an ancient city—you had to dig beneath the ground.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:30] Hall of Thought | I thought that, but Stevens would also realize that sometimes the impressions of random moments are easier than physical fatigue to make them recall the past, making the past seem to take flight and gently pass before their eyes, becoming more vivid, more enchanting, more breathtaking, and more unforgettable for life.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:35] Flandres Hotel | I sometimes saw Steven on the verge of collapse from exhaustion, having spent several days watching the rehearsals and getting no sleep. How much he longed to return to the hotel!\n[1898-02-28 07:00:40] Hotel Flandres | When I saw him in bed, Steven felt a great relief, glad to have finally shaken off the magicians and witches who filled the novels of the seventeenth century, so beloved by the people.\n[1898-02-28 07:00:45] Flandres Hotel | I thought that sleep and the lazy morning after were no longer just a charming fairy tale, but perhaps also beneficial. Steven mused that any pain could find a refuge; if a good one wasn't available, at least rest could be found. These thoughts brought Steven an unexpected benefit.\n[1898-03-09 01:54:32] Outside the town of East Cloyes | I sometimes saw that on holidays Peter couldn't go out, so Steven often went to visit him at the camp. The camp was a good distance from the hotel, requiring him to leave the town and cross a dry bridge.\n[1898-03-09 05:59:34] East Sillé Aqueduct | I saw Steven standing on the dry bridge, gazing into the distance, and I felt a sense of vast openness.\n[1898-03-09 05:59:39] East Sierre Dry Bridge | I saw the wind blowing ceaselessly over these high places, and the houses on three sides of the camp courtyard were filled with wind, as if they had become a den of wind demons, constantly roaring and howling.\n[1898-03-09 14:09:39] Campsite | I saw that if Peter had something to do, Steven was waiting at his door or in the dining room, chatting with his friend. I knew he had introduced all his friends to Steven, and sometimes when he was away from the barracks, Steven would come to visit them.\n[1898-03-09 14:09:49] Campsite | I saw Steven looking down from the window at the fields a hundred meters below. I saw the fields bare, but dotted with patches of lush green seedlings, often drenched by rain and glistening in the sunlight, like bright, transparent green ribbons of enamel laid across the fields.\n[1898-03-09 14:09:59] Campsite | When I saw Steven waiting, I often overheard people talking about him. Steven quickly realized he was very popular and that everyone liked him. I knew a few soldiers, not in his company, from the wealthy middle class, who could only see the aristocratic upper class from the outside, never having been able to enter it. They had some idea of Peter's character and thus took a liking to him, along with a certain envy for this young man, since whenever they came to Willowbrook for the weekend, they always saw him having supper at the Café de la Paix with Ussy Samuel and the Prince of Orléans.\n[1898-03-09 14:10:09] Campsite | I realized that it was precisely because of this that they had introduced the concept of \"handsome\" from Peter's good-looking face, from his awkward way of walking and greeting people, from his constant habit of flicking his monocle, from his high military cap and the overly fine, too red uniform trousers.\n[1898-03-09 14:10:14] Campsite | I thought how they were right in believing that even the most elegant officer of the cavalry, even the imposing captain who had allowed Steven to spend a night in the camp, lacked this \"coolness.\" Compared to him, the captain seemed too solemn, one might even say somewhat vulgar.\n[1898-03-09 14:10:19] Campsite | I heard one of them say, \"The captain bought a new horse.\" \"He could buy every horse he wanted. On Sunday morning, Steven met Peter on the Linden Road, and the new horse he was riding was really something!\" another one countered.\n[1898-03-10 07:59:25] Campsite | I knew the social class to which these young men belonged, and although they did not often mingle with the upper classes, they had plenty of money and leisure. Everything that could be bought with money, they had bought, and in this respect, they were no different from the aristocracy. I thought that the people who spoke this way seemed very knowledgeable, and their elegance, such as their clothing, was nothing more than a more deliberate pursuit of perfection compared to Peter's careless, indifferent kind of elegance (Steven's grandmother especially admired this manner).\n[1898-03-10 07:59:30] Campsite | I thought that for the sons of these big bankers or stockbrokers, it must be exciting to see Peter officer sitting at the next table when they went to eat oysters after the play.\n[1898-03-10 07:59:35] Campsite | I saw that every Monday, when people returned from their vacations, they would talk about all sorts of experiences. I knew one of them was from Peter's squadron; he said Peter had greeted him \"very kindly.\" The other wasn't in the same squadron, but he was certain Peter had recognized him, because he had looked in his direction several times through his monocle.\n[1898-03-10 07:59:40] Campsite | I heard, \"Really, Steven saw him at the 'Peace' café, and he was wearing a suit that looked long and loose.\" I know there was another person who spent the day at his mistress's house.\n[1898-03-10 07:59:45] Campsite | \"I heard, 'What kind of undershirt was he wearing?' 'He wasn't wearing a white undershirt, but a pale purple one, decorated with all sorts of palm-leaf-shaped medals—it was fascinating!'\"\n[1898-03-10 07:59:50] Campsite | I knew that as for those old soldiers (they were all common people who didn't know about the The Union, and just classified Peter as a very wealthy non-commissioned officer. Any non-commissioned officer who lived quite luxuriously, had a considerable income or debt, and was generous with soldiers, whether or not he was bankrupt, was considered to be in this category). I thought of Peter's way of walking, his monocle, his military trousers and cap. To them, these things might not have had an aristocratic air, but they had a certain charm of their own.",

    "text": "[1898-03-10 07:59:55] Campus | I thought about how they saw Peter's traits—the easygoing manner, the personality that didn't flatter the officers' intentions—completely matched the character and demeanor that they had set as the standard for the most popular noncommissioned officer in the cavalry. They believed that being kind to the soldiers necessarily meant not flattering the officers' intentions.\n[1898-03-10 08:00:00] Campsite | I saw that when people drank coffee in their dormitories in the morning, or took a nap in bed at noon, if an old soldier told the lazy and greedy cavalry squad an interesting story about Peter's military cap, they would drink more heartily or rest more peacefully.\n[1898-03-11 15:10:14] Campus | I heard, \"As tall as Steven's backpack.\"\n[1898-03-11 15:10:19] Campsite | I saw a young literature graduate interrupt him. \"I heard, 'Come on, old chap, who do you think you're trying to fool, Steven? How could it be as tall as your backpack?\" I thought he used the dialectal term \"kuang\" in an attempt not to reveal that he was a new recruit, and his boldness in contradicting the veteran was to confirm a fact that greatly interested him.\n[1898-03-11 15:10:24] Campsite | \"I heard, 'What! Not as tall as Steven's backpack? You measured it? Steven, tell him, the major is staring at him like he wants to put him in detention.'\"\n[1898-03-11 15:10:29] Campground | I heard someone say, \"Don't think that Steven's famous Peter would be shocked. He walked back and forth, looking down and up, constantly twirling his monocle. But it all depends on what the captain has to say. Ah! He probably won't say anything, but he definitely won't be happy. That military cap isn't even worth much.\n[1898-03-11 15:10:34] Campsite | I saw the young literary graduate meticulously picking over his words, showing off the new grammatical structures he had just learned, and taking great pride in embellishing his conversation with military jargon. I heard, \"How did you find out, old chap? Did you get it from that damned corporal of Steven's again?\"\n[1898-03-11 15:10:39] Campsite | I heard, \"How did Steven know? Of course, he heard from his valet!\"\n[1898-03-11 15:10:44] Campground | I heard, \"That person you were talking about must be living a fine life!\"\n[1898-03-11 15:10:49] Campsite | \"I heard 'Of course! He has more money than Steven, that's certain! And then Peter even gives him clothes, everything. He never eats enough in the dining hall. Peter from Steven came to the dining hall, and the cook heard Peter say, 'Steven wants him to eat well, it doesn't matter how much it costs.'\"\n[1898-03-12 15:40:36] Campus | I thought of the old soldier's vigorous tone, which compensated for his unremarkable speech. His imitation, though not very skillful, was remarkably successful.\n[1898-03-12 15:40:41] Flandres Hotel | I saw that Steven would have to go stay in a hotel the next day. I thought about how it would be sad to know that Steven was already there before I arrived. This sad feeling was like a suffocating fragrance, one that any new room, in other words, any room, would emit ever since Steven's birth, a scent that made Steven feel breathless.\n[1898-03-12 15:40:46] Flandres Hotel | I thought of the room where Steven usually lived, and yet Steven seemed to be nowhere; Steven's thoughts were elsewhere, and only habit took the place of thought.\n[1898-03-12 15:40:51] Flandres Hotel | I thought that when arriving at a new place, Steven would no longer be able to get used to it—the maid, who was less sensitive than Steven—would not take care of Steven's clothes, because Steven had arrived earlier, all alone, and had to make \"Steven\" come into contact with the things of the new place.\n[1898-03-12 15:40:56] Flandres Hotel | I saw him crying uncontrollably beside a box that had been thoroughly messed up. I thought of this \"Steven,\" who I only found again every few years, but he never changed. He had not grown up since Steven left Sunrise, since his first visit to Riverside.\n[1898-03-12 15:41:01] Flandres Hotel | I saw that the ancient building still retained its lavish opulence, overflowing to the brim. I thought that Steven was wrong. Steven didn't have time to worry, because Steven never had a single minute alone.\n[1898-03-12 15:41:06] Flandres Hotel | I thought that Steven would have found this extreme luxury out of place in a modern hotel, but here it didn't seem at all forced; it displayed a vitality even in idleness.\n[1898-03-14 12:35:39] Flandres Hotel Corridor | I saw the corridor winding aimlessly, where people could meet at any moment; the front hall of the guest room was long like a corridor, decorated just like a living room, and it was more like a guest of the hotel than part of it.\n[1898-03-14 12:35:54] Hallway of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw that they were not confined to a set of enclosed rooms, but instead lingered around Steven's room, coming to keep him company the moment he arrived. I thought of them as somewhat like the little ghosts of an older era, idle but silent, left to linger at the doors of rented rooms. Whenever Steven met them on the road, they always showed their quiet concern for him.\n[1898-03-14 12:35:59] Flandres Hotel | I thought that in general, the idea of a house— if a house is merely a place for Steven's everyday life, a place that keeps Steven from freezing and hides him from outsiders— this notion was absolutely unsuitable for this house.\n[1898-03-14 12:36:04] Flandres Hotel | I saw people returning from outside, inevitably coming across them, either avoiding them or greeting them warmly. I thought of this, and the rooms became as real as people, though they remained silent.\n[1898-03-15 04:55:48] The Large Parlor of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw it lying there quietly, and people tried not to disturb it. Every time they saw it, they showed it respect. I saw that the large drawing room had been accustomed, since the eighteenth century, to its dim yellow walls and colorful ceiling.\n[1898-03-15 09:00:50] Flandres Hotel | I saw them in such vast numbers that I couldn't count them, like a group of deserters, heedless of symmetry or order, fleeing from the grand salon in all directions, panicking and scattering in chaos, until they reached the garden, crossed three dilapidated steps, and disappeared smoothly into the garden. I thought of those small rooms, which made one feel more intimate and curious.\n[1898-03-15 13:05:52] The Staircase at the Hotel de Flandres | I saw that if Steven wanted to go to his room without taking the elevator or being seen on the main staircase, a narrower, abandoned service staircase would offer its steps to Steven.\n[1898-03-15 13:06:07] The Staircase at the Hotel de Flandres | I saw the steps, one after another, arranged skillfully up and down. I thought that within their progression, a perfect harmony seemed to be released, the kind that Stevens can feel in colors, scents, and flavors, a harmony that often stirs infinite sensory pleasure in Steven.\n[1898-03-15 13:06:12] The Staircase at the Hotel de Flandres | I thought, but the physical pleasure of climbing stairs was something Steven only felt once he arrived here, as before, but it was only in the Alps that Steven realized the simple act of breathing, usually unnoticed, could give a sense of eternal delight.\n[1898-03-15 13:06:17] The Staircase at the Hotel de Flandres | I felt that Steven found it very easy to climb these stairs for the first time (usually, it is only through familiarity with something that effort is reduced). I thought that, as if the things had already been familiar with Steven before he knew them, as if they had given Steven the sense of comfort that only habit could produce.\n[1898-03-15 13:06:22] The Staircase at the Hotel de Flandres | I thought that Steven had not yet developed the habit, and once he did, the power of the habit would weaken for him, perhaps because the former master, who used to greet and see off them every day, had woven that sense of comfort into their very being.",

    "text": "[1898-03-16 09:31:02] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven open a room, and the double doors closed behind him. I saw that the pleated curtains brought a sense of stillness. I thought, but Steven felt as if he had become king, overwhelmed with ecstasy.\n[1898-03-16 09:31:12] Marcel's Room | I saw a low chair where Steven was sitting by the fire to keep warm, and Steven was as comfortable as if he were sitting on the carpet. I saw a marble fireplace adorned with bronze reliefs — it was a great mistake to think it represented only the art of the Directory period — and it was lit for Steven.\n[1898-03-16 09:31:22] Marcel's Room | I saw the walls tightly embracing the room, isolating it from the outside world; there were wardrobes on the walls to store things inside; and there was a space left for the bed, which had a few pillars on either side gently supporting the raised ceiling above the headboard.\n[1898-03-16 09:31:37] Marcel's Room | I saw two small rooms at the front of the large room, as wide as the large room itself, and in the back room, a string of prayer beads made from the roots of blue violets was hanging on the wall. I thought of this string of beads that gives pleasure, adding a pleasant fragrance for those who come here to find peace and refreshment.\n[1898-03-16 09:31:52] Marcel's Room | I saw that if Steven slipped into this small room, he left all the doors open. It would make the small room suddenly expand three times its size without ruining its sense of harmony, not only giving Steven the pleasure of being compressed and then released, but also adding a feeling of freedom to his otherwise inviolable, yet no longer enclosed and quiet, pleasure.\n[1898-03-16 09:31:57] Marcel's Room | I saw that the small room's window opened out onto a courtyard. I thought of her as a lonely beauty seen from above.\n[1898-03-17 08:00:00] Marcel's Room | I saw that the next morning, Steven found the courtyard surrounded by high walls with no windows. I saw only two tall, withered trees in the courtyard, but they were enough to add a soft purple hue to the cloudless blue sky. I thought how lucky Steven was to have this lonely beauty as his neighbor.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:20] Hallway of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw before going to sleep, Steven left the room, wanting to conduct a thorough exploration of his amazing domain.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:25] Corridor of the Hôtel de Flandres | I saw Steven walking down a long corridor, which one by one revealed its treasures to him. I thought that as long as Steven was not sleepy, it would be willing to offer all its treasures to Steven.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:30] Corridor of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw an armchair in the corner, an old piano, a blue clay vase filled with gloxinias placed on a narrow shelf with curling legs on the wall, a ghostly image of an ancient woman framed in an old frame, her powdered hair adorned with a few blue flowers, holding a bouquet of carnations.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:35] Hallway of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw Steven come to the end of the corridor. I said honestly to Steven, \"It's time to go back now, but you see, this is your home.\"\n[1898-03-17 22:59:40] Corridor of the Hôtel de Flandres | I thought, but the soft carpet, in gratitude for the favor it had received, told Steven that if he didn't sleep at night, he could certainly come barefoot. And those windows facing the open fields, without shutters, assured Steven they would stay awake all night; no matter when Steven came, he wouldn't have to worry about waking them up.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:45] Corridor of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw that behind a curtain, Steven discovered a small room, blocked by a wall, with no way to escape. I thought of Steven, who felt nervous and hidden there, anxiously staring at his cow's eyes, which had turned leek-white under the moonlight.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:50] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven go to bed. I thought that the down comforter, the small column, and the little stove kept Steven in a state completely different from when he was in Willowbrook, preventing him from indulging in his usual habit of daydreaming.\n[1898-03-17 22:59:55] Marcel's Room | I thought of this special state of attention surrounding sleep, which affected and altered sleep, linking it directly to a series of memories belonging to Steven. Therefore, the images filling Steven's first night's dream could not be connected to the series of memories he normally dealt with during his usual sleep.\n[1898-03-17 23:00:00] Marcel's Room | I saw that when sleeping, Steven tried to pull himself back into the series of memories he was accustomed to. I thought, but then the image of Steven's still-unaccustomed bed and the attention required when turning over to maintain a sleeping position would come up, correcting or maintaining Steven's new train of thought in his dream.\n[1898-03-18 07:00:00] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven wake up. The bright, sunny sky was urging Steven to get up. I saw it, but the bright, crisp morning of early winter was chilly, making Steven reluctant to leave his bed.\n[1898-03-18 14:36:55] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven lift his head, stretch his neck, with half his body still under the covers, his eyes wide open, staring out at the trees through the window. I saw the leaves, for once unlike their usual appearance, like a few patches of color painted on an invisible canvas, golden and red, hanging in the air.\n[1898-03-18 14:37:05] Marcel's Room | I thought of Steven as a caterpillar undergoing metamorphosis, possessing a duality, where one environment was hard to adapt to the various parts of Steven's body: Steven's vision required only color, indifferent to warmth, while his chest, on the contrary, needed only warmth, indifferent to color.\n[1898-03-19 07:00:00] Marcel's Room | I didn't get up until Steven had lit the fire. I saw the golden and purple morning as a clear and pleasing picture.\n[1898-03-19 15:06:52] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven staring at the morning scene painting. A moment ago, Steven had fanned the fire, artificially adding a warm tone to this cold picture, something it lacked. I thought of fire as a pipe, burning cheerfully, smoking, and giving Steven a coarse yet subtle pleasure. It was coarse because the pleasure was based on physical comfort; it was subtle because it evoked for Steven a vague and pure fantasy.\n[1898-03-19 15:06:57] Marcel's Room | I saw a glaring red paper pasted in Steven's bathroom, covered with black and white flowers. I thought Steven's eyes had difficulty adjusting. But these flowers kept appearing before Steven in new forms, forcing Steven to engage with them rather than resist, and altering the cheerful, song-filled atmosphere he had when he woke up; these flowers forced Steven to stand in the midst of a red sea, looking at this new residence, a world different from Willowbrook.\n[1898-03-19 15:07:02] Marcel's Room | I saw this new residence as a pleasant screen, with fresh air continuously flowing in, completely different in orientation from Steven's parents' house.\n[1898-03-19 15:07:07] Marcel's Room | I thought about how Steven had been restless for days, or longed to see his grandmother, fearing she might be ill at home, or remembering a project he had left in Willowbrook that was not going well at the moment. (Even here, sometimes Steven had a way of deliberately making things difficult for himself.)\n[1898-03-19 15:07:12] Marcel's Room | I thought about these worries, one or another would emerge to disturb Steven's sleep. Steven was powerless to dispel Steven's sorrow, and Steven felt that in an instant, the entire course of Steven's life was shrouded in gloom.\n[1898-03-22 03:37:41] Marcel's Room | I saw that Steven had someone from the hotel go to the barracks to deliver a message to Peter, telling him that if possible—Steven knew it was very difficult— he hoped he would come visit Steven.\n[1898-03-23 03:45:37] Marcel's Room | I saw that he arrived an hour later. As soon as the doorbell rang, Steven felt all his worries instantly vanish. I thought that Steven knew that worry was a strength before Steven, but a weakness before Peter.\n[1898-03-23 03:45:42] Marcel's Room | I thought that when he arrived, Steven's attention would set aside Steven's worries and turn to him, expecting him to make a decision.\n[1898-03-23 03:45:47] Marcel's Room | I saw him arrive, and he brought with him the energy he had fully displayed that morning, creating a vibrant atmosphere around Steven, which was completely different from the mood of Steven's room. I thought how Steven had quickly adapted to the new environment and made the appropriate response.",

Steven is in a terrible mood, as you probably guessed.\"\n[1898-03-26 04:09:30] Marcel's Room | \"I heard, 'No, Steven thought you wanted to see Steven, and Steven felt that was fine. You sent for Steven, and Steven is happy. What's the matter? What's wrong? What can Steven do for you?'\"\n[1898-03-28 04:25:17] Marcel's Room | I saw Steven openly express his inner worries to him. He listened and unreservedly answered Steven's questions. I thought that he had already turned Steven into someone just like him, even before he had spoken.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:22] Marcel's Room | I thought about how his heavy workload made him rush all day, his mind active and his mood light. Steven felt the same way; the troubles that had disturbed Steven's thoughts just moments ago were really nothing compared to his heavy workload.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:27] Marcel's Room | I thought of Steven like a sick person who hadn't been able to open his eyes for several days. People called in a doctor, who gently and skillfully opened the patient's eyelids and removed a grain of sand; the patient recovered and his mind was at rest.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:32] Marcel's Room | I saw all of Steven's troubles turn into a telegram, and Peter volunteered to send it. I thought that Steven seemed to feel that life had completely changed, becoming so beautiful, and Steven felt full of strength, truly wanting to do something.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:37] Parade Ground | I saw it, but not for long. Soon Steven became interested in military theory (Peter's friends often discussed it at dinner), and so Steven began to frequently attend cavalry exercises. I thought of Steven, whose mind was constantly preoccupied with wanting to take a close look at their various superiors, just like those people who make music their main subject of study and spend their entire lives in concert halls, eagerly frequenting cafés and immersing themselves in the lives of the musicians.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:42] Flandres Hotel | I realized that getting to the parade ground would require a long walk, and Steven, exhausted after dinner, wanted to go to sleep immediately. His head was dizzy, and he swayed unsteadily from side to side.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:47] Flandres Hotel | I thought of Steven trying to get up, and felt unable to move—this was a very comfortable sensation. Steven seemed to be tightly bound by muscles and nourishing roots to an unfathomable, invisible land, and his fatigue had made his joints unusually sensitive.\n[1898-03-28 04:25:52] Flandres Hotel | I thought of Steven, who felt he had an endless amount of energy, and the road ahead seemed longer because Steven had retreated back into his childhood.\n[1898-03-31 23:26:47] Outside the gates of East Guéret | I saw Steven standing on the dry bridge, gazing into the distance, and I felt the view was very expansive. I saw the strong wind blowing unceasingly across these high places, filling the buildings on three sides of the camp courtyard with wind, as if they had become a nest of wind demons, constantly roaring and howling.\n[1898-04-01 04:06:13] Campsite | I often heard people talking about him when I saw Steven waiting. I knew that Steven would soon realize how well-liked he was, that everyone liked him. A few soldiers, who had never managed to enter the aristocratic world, had some slight understanding of Peter's character and thus developed a liking for him, mixed with envy for this young man.\n[1898-04-01 04:06:23] Campus | I thought of their handsome face from Peter, of his awkward way of walking and greeting people, of his constant habit of flicking his monocle, of his high military cap and the overly fine, too red uniform trousers, all of which introduced the concept of \"handsome.\"\n[1898-04-01 13:25:04] Place d'Eastchiel | I saw Steven take a last walk around the camp before leaving. As the sun set, Steven headed toward his hotel. I saw on the square, the setting sun casting a series of rose-red clouds, matching the color of the bricks, over the castle's roof, which looked like a gunpowder barrel. These clouds softened the brick color through reflection, thus making the tones of the bricks and tiles harmonious.\n[1898-04-01 13:25:14] Place d'Estoril | I saw Steven jump with every step he took, his feet bouncing off the paving stones of the square as if he had Mercury's wings on his heels. I saw a fountain glowing with a pale red light, and another glistening under the moonlight with a milky sheen. A group of children were playing between the two pools, shouting with joy, circling around like swifts or bats, since it was already late.\n[1898-04-01 22:43:55] East Sillé | I saw gas lamps already lit in the Forbidden City and the Orange Garden. The gas lamps emitted a golden glow, which harmonized beautifully with the tall, eighteenth-century windows still retaining the light of the setting sun, like a golden tortoiseshell ornament set against red-glowing hair. I thought of the dim light, and Steven longed to see Steven's fire and Steven's light again.\n[1898-04-02 03:23:20] Flandres Hotel | I saw Steven, eager to see the lights earlier, hurrying back to the hotel before dark as if he were rushing home for a late snack. I saw that at the front of the hotel where Steven was staying, only the light in Steven's room was fighting against the dusk.\n[1898-04-02 08:02:46] Marcel's Room | I saw the dim glow of the fire, the sky-blue wallpaper, the rose-red corkscrew, the tablecloth with strange patterns spread over the round table, and a stack of schoolboy paper waiting expectantly for Steven, along with a bottle of ink and a novel by Christopher. I thought how this sensitivity made surfaces that usually seemed dull and unadorned become so full and complete, and Steven felt they now contained a special kind of life.\n[1898-04-02 19:00:00] East Siret Street | I saw Steven put on his coat at seven o'clock and go out again to have dinner with him at the hotel in Peter. Steven liked to walk there. I saw that it had turned pitch-black. From the third day since Steven arrived here, as soon as it got dark, a biting cold wind would blow, as if it were going to snow.\n[1898-04-02 19:00:05] East Siret Street | I saw that, in theory, Steven should have been constantly thinking of Edward on the road, because it was precisely to get close to her that Steven had come to Peter's garrison. I thought, but human memory and worries are capricious. Sometimes they go far away, so that the Stevenes can hardly see them, and they think they have left the Stevenes forever. Then the Stevenes begin to pay attention to other things.\n[1898-04-02 19:00:15] East Sierre Street | I saw Steven stop in his tracks and stand motionless in the dark, gazing for a long time. I saw here that the god of fire displayed a picture painted purple, showing a small inn run by a chestnut merchant, where two officers were deeply engrossed in playing cards. Their belts lay on the chairs, and they had no idea that the magician had brought them out of darkness, just as characters are brought onto the stage in a play.\n[1898-04-02 19:00:30] East Siret Street | I saw in that small secondhand shop a half-burned candle casting a flickering red glow onto a print, transforming it into a chalk drawing, while that big lamp was struggling against the darkness, casting light around it and turning a filthy, miserable room filled with forgeries and bread crusts into an extremely precious masterpiece by Rembrandt.\n[1898-04-02 19:00:35] East Siret Street | I saw that on the dark little street in front of the church, Steven was unable to move forward, overcome by an unbearable desire, just as he had been before on the path to Sunrise. I thought of Steven, who felt that a woman would suddenly appear to satisfy his desires.\n[1898-04-02 19:00:40] East Sierre Street | I saw Steven unable to restrain himself from opening his arms to embrace a frightened passerby. I thought that if, in the darkness, Steven suddenly felt a skirt brushing past him, he would shudder with joy all over, unable to believe that this sound was merely the result of a chance encounter.",

    "text": "[1898-04-03 16:38:45] East Siret Street | I saw Steven back on the street again, jumping onto a small trolleybus. I saw an officer, from the platform outside the car, barely acknowledging the salute of the soldiers standing on the sidewalk. The soldiers looked clumsy, their faces painted a glaring red by the cold wind, which reminded me of the cheerful and gluttonous peasants in a painting by old Bruegel, whose faces were blue from the cold.\n[1898-04-03 21:18:10] Hotel | I saw Steven arrive at the hotel where Steven, Peter, and his friends were meeting. I saw that the celebration starting at the neighboring exhibition hall was drawing many villagers and people from far away here. The courtyard of the hotel led to the kitchen, which glowed with a pale red light. People were roasting chickens and pigs, throwing lively lobsters into what the hotel owner called the \"eternally burning stove.\"\n[1898-04-04 01:57:36] Courtyard of the hotel | I saw Steven walking directly through the courtyard when the crowd rushed in. I could truly compare this scene to those depicted in the works of old Flemish painters.\n[1898-04-04 06:37:02] The Grand Restaurant | I saw that before reaching the small restaurant where Steven's friend was waiting for him, I had to pass through the main dining room. Steven was passing through here for the first time. I saw Steven watching the waiter, out of breath, carrying fish, tender little hens, pheasants, snipes, and pigeons—colorful and steaming hot. The abundant dishes reminded Steven of those sacred meals depicted in paintings that exuded the simplicity of antiquity and the exaggeration of Flanders.\n[1898-04-04 06:37:12] The restaurant's main dining hall | I saw the waiter gliding across the parquet floor, placing those snipes and similar dishes onto a large table with spiral legs built into the wall. I saw them placed on the table and immediately cut open, but they were all still stacked there untouched.\n[1898-04-04 06:37:22] Grand Dining Room | I saw Steven walk towards him. I thought of Steven wanting to ask him where the dining room for Steven's group was, because only he seemed somewhat calm and able to answer Steven's question.\n[1898-04-04 06:37:27] The dining hall of the hotel | I saw in the center of the dining room a huge sculpture holding a pastry in its hands; sometimes the sculpture was supported by the ice-carved wings of a duck, which was daily crafted by an expert chef using a red-hot iron to carve it in the authentic Flemish style.\n[1898-04-04 06:37:32] The hotel's main dining room | I saw that in the dining room, another deity had been added besides the statue — a heavenly figure, completely copied from the ranks of the angels and archangels from heaven. A young musical angel, with golden hair and the fresh face of a fourteen-year-old child.\n[1898-04-04 06:37:37] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I saw Steven avoid the vaguely defined areas separated by palm tree curtains, forging a path through them to reach the small dining room where Peter's table was located.\n[1898-04-05 19:00:00] Small restaurant in the hotel | I saw Steven arrive for dinner for the first time, and before everyone had even taken their seats, he pulled Peter into a corner of the small dining room, and spoke to him in a hushed voice in front of everyone, but so that no one else could hear. \"I heard 'Peter,' that it's inappropriate to tell you about this matter at such a time and place, but it'll be over soon. In the barracks, Steven always forgot to ask you, isn't the photo on your desk not Edward?\"\n[1898-04-05 19:00:05] Small restaurant in the hotel | \"I heard, 'Why not? That's Steven's aunt, isn't it?'\"\n[1898-04-05 19:00:10] Restaurant's small dining room | I heard: \"Why, of course! Steven is really silly. Steven already knew, but just never thought of it. Steven's God, your friends are getting impatient. Let's get on with it, they're watching the Stevens. May be we can save it for next time, after all, it's not that important.\"\n[1898-04-05 19:00:15] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I heard, \"No, go ahead, let them wait.\"\n[1898-04-05 19:00:20] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I heard, \"You know her, that honest Edward.\"\n[1898-04-06 09:50:43] Small restaurant in the hotel | I thought of how he said \"Good Edward,\" and this \"good Edward\" didn't mean that Peter thought of Edward particularly highly. In such cases, \"good,\" \"excellent,\" \"honest\"—these words were merely used to emphasize \"that,\" referring to someone both of them knew, but because the other person wasn't part of your circle, you didn't know what to say to him.\n[1898-04-06 09:50:48] Restaurant's Small Dining Room | \"I heard that 'you said the photo was hers,' and Steven was very happy because now the Stevenes are living in her mansion, and Steven heard many unheard-of things about her (Steven couldn't speak them openly), so Steven became interested in her. That's from a literary point of view, you understand, I mean, from Unknown_Balzac's point of view.\"\n[1898-04-06 09:50:53] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I heard, \"What do your friends think of Steven's upbringing?\"\n[1898-04-06 09:50:58] Small restaurant in the hotel | \"I heard 'He has no opinion at all. Steven told them, you are a noble man, so they are more constrained than you.'\"\n[1898-04-06 09:51:03] Restaurant's Small Dining Room | \"I heard, 'You're too kind. Ah, now let's get to the point. Steven is asking you: won't Edward know that Steven knows you?'\"\n[1898-04-06 09:51:08] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I heard, \"Steven doesn't know anything. Not since summer, Steven hasn't seen her yet. Since she went back to Willowbrook, Steven hasn't taken any leave.\"\n[1898-04-06 09:51:13] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I heard, \"Because Steven wants to tell you that someone definitely told Steven that she thinks Steven is a big fool.\"\n[1898-04-06 09:51:18] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"This Steven doesn't believe it. Edward may not be particularly intelligent, but she's certainly not stupid.\"\n[1898-04-06 09:51:23] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"For Edward, if you could tell her your impressions of Steven, even if they're a bit exaggerated, Steven would be happy.\"\n[1898-04-06 09:51:28] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"My pleasure. If all you're asking Steven to do is such a small favor, it's no problem at all.\"\n[1898-04-07 13:47:36] Small restaurant in the hotel | I realized that it was precisely this discomfort that had given Steven the courage to talk to Peter about it. With someone else present, Steven had an excuse, and his words could be brief and incoherent.\n[1898-04-07 13:47:41] Restaurant's small dining room | \"I heard 'Peter, you're so clever, yet you don't understand that a friend's request should only be obeyed, not questioned—this surprised Steven greatly. If it were Steven, no matter what you asked Steven to do (Steven would even have wanted you to ask him to do something), Steven guarantees that Steven would never have asked you for any explanation.'\"\n[1898-04-07 13:47:46] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"Actually, Steven was exaggerating. Steven didn't really want to meet Edward. But to test you, Steven had intended to tell you that he was having dinner with Edward, knowing full well you wouldn't help.\"\n[1898-04-07 13:47:51] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"Not only will I do it, but I will definitely carry it out.\"\n[1898-04-07 13:47:56] Restaurant's Small Dining Room | I heard \"When?\" \"Wait until Steven returns to Willowbrook, it might take another three weeks.\"\n[1898-04-07 13:48:01] Small Restaurant in the Hotel | I heard, \"We'll see when the time comes. Besides, she might not even be willing. Steven doesn't know how to thank you!\"",

The other is more important to Steven, but Steven was afraid you'd refuse: Steven and his friends address each other with 'you,' would that be inconvenient for you?\" I thought Steven's tenderness had been aroused.\n[1898-04-07 13:48:11] Small restaurant in the hotel | \"I heard, 'What's inconvenient about it! That's wonderful! Happiness! Happiness to the point of tears! Unprecedented happiness!\"\n[1898-04-07 13:48:16] Small restaurant in the hotel | \"I heard 'Thank you very much... for you. When you start addressing Steven as 'you,' Steven will certainly be very happy. If you're willing, you can even leave Edward's matter alone, as long as you address Steven as 'you,' Steven will be satisfied.\"\n[1898-04-07 13:48:21] Small restaurant table at the hotel | I saw Steven once again speaking to Peter at the table. \"I heard 'Ah! Peter! ' As Steven said, ah! That incoherent conversation just now was so comically absurd, and Steven doesn't know why—do you know who the lady was that Steven just spoke to you about?\"\n[1898-04-07 13:48:26] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I heard, \"You wouldn't want to show her photo to Steven, would you?\"\n[1898-04-10 02:19:58] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I thought that Steven had originally intended to borrow it for a few days, but when he finally spoke, Steven hesitated, sensing that his request was inappropriate. To prevent him from noticing, Steven ended up phrasing his request even more abruptly and impolitely, as if this made it perfectly natural.\n[1898-04-10 02:20:03] Small restaurant table at the hotel | I saw him say. I heard, \"No, Steven has to get her permission first.\"\n[1898-04-10 02:20:08] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I saw Peter's face turn red all of a sudden. I thought Steven understood that he had some thoughts he couldn't bring himself to express, and he believed Steven had hidden motives, only willing to serve Steven's love halfway, keeping certain moral principles to himself. Steven was beginning to hate him a little.\n[1898-04-10 02:20:13] Small Restaurant Table | I saw that when Steven and Peter returned to his friends, he showed particular kindness to Steven in front of them. I thought that this would deeply move Steven, and if Steven had considered this familiarity to be fake, he would not have been moved.\n[1898-04-10 02:20:18] Small Restaurant Table | I saw, and now he glanced at his friend, watching whether Steven's words would have the expected effect he had foretold to them. I thought that even the exchange between Robert and her daughter on stage, along with the audience's reaction, could not compare to Peter's attention when he spoke to Steven.\n[1898-04-10 02:20:23] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I saw one evening when Steven wanted to tell them a funny story about Madame Bontemps. I thought of it, but Steven didn't continue, because he suddenly remembered that Peter had already heard it. Steven had intended to tell it to him the very next day when he arrived here, but instead, Peter interrupted Steven and said, \"At Riverside you told it to Steven already.\"\n[1898-04-11 20:00:00] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I didn't expect that that evening he encouraged Steven to go on, saying he had indeed never heard the story and that he would definitely be interested. \"I heard, 'No, you've made a mistake, Steven has assured you. You've never told Steven anything. Come on, tell me.'\" I thought this surprised Steven.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:05] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I saw that as Steven spoke, he remained very excited, his joyful eyes alternately looking at Steven and then at his friend. I realized, after he finished speaking, that he had wanted, through this story, to give his friends a full understanding of Steven's intelligence. That was precisely why he had pretended not to have heard it. That was friendship.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:15] Small Restaurant Table | I saw Peter speak to Steven about another colleague who had also come here, and their relationship was especially close. I knew that among this group, only the two of them advocated for a retrial of the Unknown_Dreyfus case.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:20] Small Restaurant Table | \"I heard 'Oh, him! He's not like Peter, he's completely fanatical.'\" Steven's new friend said to Steven.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:25] Small Restaurant Table | I heard him say, \"He wasn't even honest. At first he said, 'Wait. There's a Steven who knows General de Boisfeuille well, very shrewd and very kind. The Stevenes could readily accept his opinion.' But when he found out that General de Boisfeuille had declared Unknown_Dreyfus guilty, he dismissed him completely.\"\n[1898-04-11 20:00:30] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I heard him say, \"So he told Steven and the others that the truth would eventually come to light, because this case would be handled by Sosset, a veteran who supported the republican government, with a steel-like will and an unyielding belief.\"\n[1898-04-11 20:00:35] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I saw Steven turn his face halfway toward Peter, and then the other half toward his colleague so that he could also take part in the conversation. \"I heard 'You see,' Steven said, 'because people believe that environment influences a person, but ideas have a greater influence. Everyone has an idea or point of view. But there are far fewer ideas than people. Therefore, people with the same viewpoint are all pretty much the same. However, ideas aren't concrete, so the people who live around someone with an abstract viewpoint can't change that person's views in the least.'\"\n[1898-04-11 20:00:40] Small restaurant table in the hotel | At that moment, Peter's reprimand interrupted Steven's words, because a young officer had been smilingly pointing at Steven and saying something to him. I heard, \"Duroc, exactly like Duroc.\" I thought Steven didn't know what it meant, but Steven felt that the timid expression on the face was very familiar.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:45] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I saw Peter reprimanding the troublemaker. I heard him say, \"Hiberg, don't interrupt when others are speaking. Speak only after everyone has finished. Now, please continue.\" He said this to Steven. I thought that, in Peter's eyes, when Steven was speaking, the compliments others paid to Steven were superfluous, and he wanted everyone to be quiet.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:50] Small Restaurant Table at the Hotel | I saw Steven relax and continued. I heard, \"Because a point of view is not part of material interests and cannot benefit from them, people who share the same point of view are not influenced by material interests.\" I thought about how Steven was worried that he would make Steven start all over again.\n[1898-04-11 20:00:55] Small Restaurant Table | I saw Steven had just finished speaking when Peter exclaimed, his eyes never leaving Steven, his expression concerned and anxious, as if Steven were walking a tightrope. I heard, \"Hey! Steven's kids, now you're really stunned, aren't you? Sieburg, what were you about to say?\"\n[1898-04-11 20:01:00] Small Restaurant Table | \"I heard Steven say that the gentleman looked like Major Duroc. Just a moment ago, Steven had thought it was the major speaking.\"\n[1898-04-11 20:01:05] Restaurant small dining table | I saw Peter answer. I heard, \"Steven had already thought of that. There are many similarities, but you'll see he has things that Duroc doesn't.\"\n[1898-04-13 12:55:30] East Sillé | I saw Steven walking around before leaving the camp, as the sun was setting, Steven headed towards Steven's hotel. I saw on the square, the setting sun casting clouds of rose-red, harmonizing with the color of the bricks, upon the castle's roof, which looked like a gunpowder barrel, while reflecting back to soften the brick color, thus making the tones of the bricks and tiles harmonious.",

    "text": "[1898-04-13 16:49:43] Place d'Estoril | I saw Steven's feet bounce up each time they stepped on the stones of the square. I thought of a flow of life entering Steven's nerves, and no action of Steven's could cause that life to wane, as if his heels were adorned with Mercury's wings.\n[1898-04-13 16:49:48] Place d'Estoril | I saw a fountain sparkling with a pale red glow, and another glowing with a milky sheen under the moonlight; a group of children were playing between the two pools, shouting with delight, and, because it was already late, they circled around like swifts or bats.\n[1898-04-13 16:50:03] Place d'Estoril | I saw gas lamps lit in the Forbidden City and the Orange Garden, casting a golden glow. Against the still-lighted dusk, they harmonized perfectly with the tall, eighteenth-century windows still retaining the last light of the setting sun, like a golden tortoiseshell brooch set against red-glowing hair.\n[1898-04-14 04:32:24] In front of the Hotel de Flandres | I saw that Steven, eager to see the lights earlier, hurried back to the hotel before it got dark, as if he were rushing home for a late snack. I thought of that dim light, and Steven longed to see again Steven's fire and Steven's light.\n[1898-04-14 04:32:29] Marcel's Room | I saw the yellow glow of the fire, the sky-blue wallpaper, the rose-red corkscrew, the patterned tablecloth spread over the round table, and a stack of schoolboy paper waiting expectantly for Steven, along with a bottle of ink and a novel by Christopher. I thought that this sensitivity made surfaces which usually seemedordinary and unadorned become so full and rich. Steven felt that from that moment on, they contained a special kind of life, and as long as Steven could see them again, he could draw that life from them.\n[1898-04-14 04:32:34] Marcel's Room | I thought of Steven, happily recalling the military camp he had just left, where the weathervane turned with the wind; to take this military camp as a harbor of refuge was like linking Steven with a life conducive to health and the air of freedom.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:00] East Sillé Street | I saw Steven put on his coat at seven o'clock and go out again, to have dinner with him at the hotel in Peter where he stayed, and Steven liked to walk there. Since the third day, when I arrived here from Steven, it has been dark by evening, and a biting wind has blown, as if it were going to snow.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:05] East Sillé Street | I thought that, by all logic, Steven should have been constantly thinking of Edward on the road, since it was precisely to get close to her that Steven had come to Peter's garrison. But memory and worries are unpredictable; sometimes they go far away, so far that the Stevenes can hardly see them, thinking they have left the Stevenes forever.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:15] East Siret Street | I saw Steven stop in his tracks and stand motionless in the dark, gazing for a long time. I saw that here, the god of fire displayed a painting dyed purple, showing a small inn run by a chestnut merchant, where two officers were intently playing cards, and their belts were laid on the chairs.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:30] East Siret Street | I saw in that small secondhand shop a half-burned candle casting a flickering red light onto a print, turning it into a chalk drawing, while the big lamp struggled against the darkness, transforming a filthy room full of forgeries and bread crusts into a masterpiece by Rembrandt.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:35] East Siret Street | I saw them inside, a group of amphibious men and women who, every evening, had to re-adapt themselves to a different environment from the daytime, slowly moving through the greasy liquid. I thought that sometimes Steven would even look up at a set of old-fashioned rooms with the blinds not closed.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:40] East Siret Street | I saw that on the dark little street in front of the church, an uncontrollable desire kept Steven from moving forward, just as he had once been unable to move on the small path leading to Méséglise. I thought of Steven, who felt that a woman would suddenly appear to satisfy his desires.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:45] East Siret Street | I thought that, in the darkness, if Steven suddenly felt a skirt brushing past him, he would shudder with joy all over, unable to believe that the sound was entirely coincidental. Steven couldn't help throwing his arms open to embrace a startled passing woman.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:50] East Siret Street | I thought of this medieval street, so real in Steven's eyes, and if Steven were actually to pick up a woman and possess her, Steven could not help but believe that ancient desire had united the two of them.\n[1898-04-14 19:00:55] East Siret Street | I saw that suddenly, Steven heard voices and laughter coming from ahead, probably drunk pedestrians on their way home. Steven stopped to look at them, staring in the direction from which the sounds came. I thought about how Steven had waited for a long time without seeing a single soul, because the silence around him was so intense that even sounds from far away reached Steven's ears with an irresistible clarity.\n[1898-04-14 19:01:00] East Siret Street | I saw them at the end, but not in front of Steven as Steven had imagined, but behind Steven, far away from him. I thought that Steven had definitely made a mistake, getting both the distance and the direction wrong.\n[1898-04-16 07:17:19] East Siret Street | I saw Steven back on the street again, jumping onto a small trolleybus. I saw the wind blowing harder and harder, as if it were about to snow heavily. It was so cold that it made my skin crawl and gave me goosebumps all over.\n[1898-04-16 11:11:33] Tramcar | I saw the soldiers looked clumsy, their faces as if painted a glaring red by the cold wind. I thought of the merry, gluttonous peasants in old Bruegel's paintings, their faces frozen purple; suddenly, autumn turned into early winter, as if pulling the city far to the north.\n[1898-04-16 15:05:46] Hotel | I saw Steven arrive at the hotel where Steven, Peter, and his friends were meeting. I saw that the celebration starting at the adjacent exhibition hall had drawn many villagers and people from far away here. The courtyard of the hotel led to the kitchen, which was glowing with a pale red light, and people were roasting chickens and pigs.\n[1898-04-16 19:00:00] Courtyard of the hotel | When I saw Steven walking straight through the courtyard, I saw the crowd rushing in. A young servant was carrying a fowl, and the chick, its neck grabbed, was flapping wildly in his hands. I thought this scene could be compared to those depicted in the works of old Flemish painters.\n[1898-04-16 22:54:13] The restaurant hall | I saw that before reaching the small restaurant where Steven's friend was waiting for Steven, I had to pass through the main dining hall. I saw Steven watching the waiter, out of breath, carrying fish, tender little hens, pheasants, snipes, and pigeons, all colorful and steaming hot. I thought of Steven, who was passing here for the first time, and the abundant dishes made Steven think of those Eucharistic paintings that overflowed with the simplicity of antiquity and the exaggeration of Flanders.\n[1898-04-16 22:54:23] The Grand Restaurant | I saw the waiter gliding across the parquet floor, placing those snipes and similar birds on a large table with spiral legs built into the wall; they were immediately cut up as soon as they were placed on the table, but they were piled there untouched. I thought that the abundance of the dishes and the server's haste were not meant to satisfy the customers, but to strictly follow the description in the Bible.\n[1898-04-16 22:54:28] Grand Dining Room | I saw in the center of the dining room a huge sculpture holding a pastry in its hands, and sometimes the sculpture had to be supported by the ice-carved wings of a duck. I thought of Steven trying to ask a waiter, who was standing by the sideboard in the dining room and seemed to be lost in thought, where the table for Steven and his companions was located, since only he appeared to be somewhat calm.\n[1898-04-16 22:54:33] The hotel's main dining room | I saw Steven walking toward him, and along the way, there was a brazier every few steps; Steven nearly got knocked over several times. I thought of Steven, who had noticed that the waiter resembled a figure from traditional religious paintings: a flat nose, an unremarkable face, but simple and honest, given to daydreams.\n[1898-04-16 22:54:38] The hotel's dining room | I saw that in the dining room, in addition to the statue, another deity had been added — a young musical angel with golden hair and the delicate face of a fourteen-year-old child, lost in thought before a gong or a stack of plates.",

I knew that the friends who often dined with Peter, except for a few commoners, all came from noble families.\n[1898-04-17 18:58:45] Small restaurant in the hotel | I saw Steven arrive for dinner for the first time, and before everyone had taken their seats, he pulled Peter into a corner of the small dining room and whispered something to him. \"I heard 'Peter'—it's inappropriate to tell you about that matter at such a moment and in such a place, but it'll be over soon. In the barracks, Steven always forgot to ask you, isn't the photo on your table not Edward's?\"\n[1898-04-17 18:58:50] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"Why not? That's Steven's aunt, isn't she?\"\n[1898-04-17 18:58:55] Restaurant's small dining room | \"I heard, 'Look, isn't that true!

Steven is asking you, what do your friends think of Steven's manners?\"\n[1898-04-17 18:59:20] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard him say, \"He has no opinion at all. Steven told them, you are a noble man, so they are more constrained in your presence.\"\n[1898-04-17 18:59:25] Small restaurant in the hotel | \"I heard, 'You're too kind. Ah, now let's get to the point. Steven is asking you, won't Edward know that Steven knows you?'\"\n[1898-04-17 18:59:30] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"Steven doesn't know anything. Since the summer, Steven hasn't seen her yet. Since she returned to Willowbrook, Steven hasn't taken any leave.\"\n[1898-04-17 18:59:35] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"Because Steven wants to tell you that someone definitely told Steven that she thinks Steven is a big fool.\"\n[1898-04-17 18:59:40] Small restaurant in the hotel | I heard, \"This Steven doesn't believe it.

To hide this, he simply made his request more abrupt and improper, as if that somehow made it perfectly natural.\n[1898-04-17 19:00:45] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I heard him say, \"No, Steven has to get her permission first.\" I thought of Peter's face turning red. Steven understood what he was thinking, but he couldn't bring himself to say it out loud. He believed that Steven had hidden motives, and that he could only serve Steven's love halfway, keeping certain moral principles in reserve. Steven actually began to hate him a little.\n[1898-04-17 19:00:50] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I saw that when Steven and Peter returned to his friends, he showed particular kindness to Steven in front of them, which deeply moved Steven. I thought that if Steven believed this affection was fake, Steven wouldn't have been moved. But Steven felt he wasn't being insincere; he was simply saying things that he might have said about Steven in his absence, things he would not have said when Steven and he were alone together.\n[1898-04-17 19:00:55] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I saw him now looking at his friend out of the corner of his eye, watching whether Steven's words would produce the expected effect he had foretold to them. I thought that even the response of Robert to her daughter's first appearance on stage and the audience's reaction could not compare to Peter's attention when he spoke to Steven.\n[1898-04-17 19:01:00] Small restaurant table at the hotel | I noticed that Steven sometimes spoke unclearly. If no one was around, he would just smile gently, but if someone was there, he feared they hadn't understood and would say, \"What, what?\" to prompt Steven to repeat himself. I thought of how he had, without any intention, become the trainer who taught them to laugh, and in doing so, he had at last revealed to Steven his true opinion of Steven—which he often mentioned in front of his friends.",

    "text": "[1898-04-21 20:00:00] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | One evening, I saw Steven trying to tell them a funny story about Madame Bontemp. But Steven didn't get very far with it, because he suddenly remembered that Peter had already heard it. I didn't expect that that evening he encouraged Steven to go on, saying he had really never heard this story and that he would definitely be interested.\n[1898-04-22 16:34:32] Small restaurant table in the hotel | As Steven spoke, I saw that he was always excited, his joyful eyes alternately looking at Steven and then at his friend. I thought of Steven, and only after he finished speaking, amidst everyone's laughter, did I realize that he had wanted to use this story to fully convince his friend of Steven's intelligence. That was precisely why he had pretended not to have heard it. That was friendship.\n[1898-04-22 16:34:37] Table in the hotel's small restaurant | On the third evening, I saw that one of his friends spoke with Steven for a long time, because he hadn't had the chance to talk to Steven before. Steven heard him whisper to Peter that he found it very interesting to speak with Steven.\n[1898-04-22 16:34:42] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I saw that, in reality, the Stevenes talked for almost the entire evening, with a bottle of Sauterne before them, but the Stevenes just talked and didn't drink. I thought of the affection between men as a brilliant curtain that concealed Steven and set him apart from others. This affection, though not based on physical attraction, was a unique and mysterious feeling.\n[1898-04-23 19:07:16] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I heard him tell Steven that he had not only not made that decision, but that there had never been any such thing. He had never met the lady and did not know who she was. I knew that when Peter was talking to Steven about Riverside, Steven couldn't help asking him whether he had really made up his mind to marry Mademoiselle de Fairhaven.\n[1898-04-23 19:07:21] Small restaurant table in the hotel | \"I heard 'Oh, him! He's not like Peter at all, he's completely fanatical.'\" Steven's new friend said to Steven. I know that Peter mentioned to Steven another colleague of his who has also come here, and their relationship is especially close because among this group, only the two of them advocate for the retrial of the Unknown_Dreyfus case.\n[1898-04-23 19:07:26] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I heard him say, \"He wasn't even honest. But when he learned that General de Boisdeffre had declared Unknown_Dreyfus guilty, he lost all respect for him, saying that clericalism and the staff's prejudices had prevented him from making a sincere judgment.\"\n[1898-04-23 19:07:31] Small Restaurant Table | I saw Steven turn his face halfway toward Peter, and then the other half toward his colleague, so as to include both in the conversation. \"I heard 'You see,' Steven said, 'because people believe that environment influences a person, but ideas have a greater influence. Everyone has an idea. But there are far fewer ideas than people. So people with the same idea are almost the same.'\"\n[1898-04-23 19:07:36] Small restaurant table in the hotel | At that moment, Peter's reprimand interrupted Steven's words, because a young officer had just been smilingly pointing at Steven and saying to him, \"Duroc, exactly like Duroc.\" \"I heard 'Sibyl,' \" Peter said, \"don't interrupt when others are speaking. Wait until they're finished. Now, please go on.\"\n[1898-04-23 19:07:41] Small restaurant table at the hotel | \"I heard 'Because an idea is not part of material interests, and it cannot be enjoyed as such, so people who share the same idea are not influenced by material interests,' \" Steven continued. I thought of Steven, who had been relieved because Steven had worried that he would make Steven start all over again.\n[1898-04-23 19:07:46] Small Restaurant Table | \"I heard Steven say that the gentleman looked like Major Duroc. Just now, Steven thought it was the major speaking,\" Heiberg said.\n[1898-04-23 19:07:51] Small restaurant table in the hotel | \"I heard 'Steven had already thought of that.' Peter replied, 'There are many similarities, but you'll see he has many things that Duroc doesn't.'\"\n[1898-04-26 00:12:53] Small Restaurant Table | I knew that this friend of Peter was also like that, his \"mental state\" perfectly matching the mentality of all the revisionists. I thought that, given this officer's noble background and his religious and military education, Richard imagined him as different from others, like a distant traveler with extraordinary appeal—his family traditions and professional interests had no effect on his psyche at all.\n[1898-04-26 00:12:58] Restaurant small dining room table | I saw that Steven particularly liked talking to this young man about the military, about the officers and the army. This was also a subject that Steven often discussed with Peter's other friends, as well as with Peter himself. I thought about how, in the environments where Steven and his friends ate, talked, and lived, there were all sorts of things, no matter how trivial they might be. But once Steven and his friends saw them often enough, these things would be elevated beyond their ordinary status and would greatly increase in value in their eyes.\n[1898-04-26 00:13:03] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I thought it was just like that: Steven became very interested in all the important people in the military camp, in the officers he had met in the courtyard when he went to visit Peter, or whom he saw in the morning when he woke up, as the cavalry regiment passed by his window.\n[1898-04-26 00:13:08] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I knew it was a pity, because during this time, Peter had been completely preoccupied with the Unknown_Dreyfus case. I thought of Steven's desire to learn more about the major whom Peter greatly admired, and to understand that military history class which, even from an aesthetic standpoint, had so captivated Steven.\n[1898-04-28 05:18:10] Restaurant small dining room table | \"I heard him say, 'For example, you read a sentence like: A unit tried to... Before you continue reading, the name of this unit and its composition are not without significance.'\" Peter said with a self-satisfied smile.\n[1898-04-28 05:18:15] Restaurant small dining room table | I heard someone say, \"The entire geographical context should be studied; that's the name Steven came up with. An extremely fierce attack on a particular place might mean an attempt to capture it, but it could also be meant to draw the enemy away, so they don't retaliate where they're being attacked, or it could just be a feint, using a sharp assault to conceal the real intention of withdrawing troops from there.\"\n[1898-04-28 05:18:20] Small restaurant table in the hotel | \"I heard him say, 'In addition, the study of diplomatic actions should not be neglected, for diplomacy is always responding to or taking measures against military actions. Some seemingly unimportant diplomatic events did not attract attention at the time, yet by analyzing these events you can see that the assistance the enemy sought was actually never obtained.'\"\n[1898-04-28 05:18:25] Small Restaurant Table | I heard him say, \"These military campaigns, aside from their immediate objectives, are usually the generals in command deliberately imitating the outcomes of some older battles. These ancient battles, if you like, can be seen as the past of the new campaigns, as a library, a repository of knowledge, and a source of words.\"\n[1898-04-28 05:18:30] Small Restaurant Table | I heard that \"as long as there are wars, there will be battles like Cannae, Austerlitz, Rossbach, and Waterloo—intentionally planned by the commanders. Field Marshal Schlieffen and General von Falkenhayn had already drawn up a plan for a battle of Cannae against France.\"\n[1898-04-28 05:18:35] Small restaurant table at the hotel | I heard \"Attack, only attack.\" However, one thing puzzled Steven: he saw that those who strongly opposed this effective theory of attack were people who couldn't keep up with the times. Yet, one of Steven's youngest instructors, a man named Mangeot, who was very talented, argued that defense should be given its due place—naturally, a temporary one.",

    "text": "[1898-04-30 10:23:38] Small Restaurant Table at the Hotel | I thought that Peter's theory pleased Steven very much. The art of war that Peter had just talked about added a lasting and solid foundation to the brief but intense enthusiasm Steven had felt these past few evenings, and this knowledge was enough to firmly hold Steven's attention on all matters related to military life.\n[1898-04-30 10:23:43] Restaurant small dining room table | \"I heard 'You say people imitate certain battles, and Steven thinks, just as you said a moment ago, that a past battle is reenacted in a modern one, which has a certain aesthetic value. This idea had such a strong appeal for Steven that it's hard to put into words.'\"\n[1898-04-30 10:23:48] Small restaurant table in the hotel | \"I heard, 'But Steven wants to ask you, doesn't the commander's talent have any effect at all? Does he just follow the rules? Would some great generals emerge under the same conditions?\"\n[1898-04-30 10:23:53] Small restaurant table in the hotel | \"I heard, 'Of course there is! You'll see how Napoleon did it. If he had strictly followed the military tactics, he would have attacked, but he didn't. A vague premonition was urging him to abandon the attack. It's this kind of instinctive sense and premonition, like that of Madame de Bovary, that guides great generals and great doctors (Steven, you understand what I mean by that).\"\n[1898-04-30 10:23:58] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I heard him say, \"A battle is conducted under certain conditions and in a specific terrain, which can determine and limit the choices of a military commander. Therefore, in certain areas of the plains, in the valleys of the mountains, if you follow the mountain, you can predict that the movement of the troops will be as powerful and spectacular as an avalanche.\"\n[1898-04-30 10:24:03] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I heard him say, \"Under certain specific conditions, a general has four options before him, which he can choose from. Because the enemy's resistance is too great, he may not succeed—Steven calls this the element of chance caused by human weakness. So he abandons the first option and tries the second, third, or fourth.\"\n[1898-04-30 10:24:08] Small Restaurant Table in the Hotel | I heard him say, \"Take Steven and his cavalry, for example. They're conducting military exercises from 1895, which can be considered outdated because they're based on obsolete theories that see the combat role of cavalry as solely charging at the enemy and instilling a sense of fear in them.\"\n[1898-05-02 15:29:10] Small restaurant table in the hotel | I saw Steven, who was cut off from the cold night, hearing only the distant sound of a train or the chime of a clock now and then; this small dining room was warm and pleasant, and the dishes brought by the waiters were delicious. I thought of these delicious dishes that stirred Steven's imagination and appetite; sometimes the original source, a small piece or segment of nature, still surrounded them, causing Steven to be in a state of emotional excitement during dinner, his mind wandering, now dozing under a grapevine, now drifting on the sea.\n[1898-05-02 15:29:15] Small restaurant table in the hotel | \"I heard 'Steven is jealous, angry.'\" Peter said half-jokingly, half-seriously to Steven, alluding to Steven's endless whispers with his friend. \"Do you think he's smarter than Steven? Do you like him more than Steven? Is he the only one on your mind like that?\"\n[1898-05-02 15:29:20] Restaurant small dining room table | A week later, his two colleagues brought up the subject, saying that he, living in such a military environment, could actually take Unknown_Dreyfus's side. I heard \"This is because the influence of the environment is not as important as people think...\" Steven interjected, not wanting to discuss the issue in detail.\n[1898-05-02 15:29:25] Small Restaurant Table | \"I heard him say, 'Exactly! The environment doesn't matter. The real influence is the influence of ideas! Everyone is bound by their ideas!'\" Peter said to Steven with a self-satisfied air. I realized that he had completely forgotten that these thoughts in his mind were ones I had mentioned to him a few days earlier.\n[1898-05-05 20:00:00] East Siret Street | I saw that on several evenings, when Steven walked through the city to the hotel, he was consumed by a painful longing for Edward, so much that breathing became difficult. It was as if Steven's chest had been opened by a skilled surgeon, part of it removed and replaced with an identical amount of non-material suffering, an equal measure of nostalgia and love.\n[1898-05-05 20:00:05] East Siret Street | I saw Steven gazing up at the sky. If the moon was bright and the stars were shining brightly, Steven would think: \"Perhaps she is in the countryside, looking at the same stars as I am. May be when I get to the hotel, Peter will say to me, 'Good news, Steven, your aunt has just written to you, she wants to see you and is coming here soon.'\"\n[1898-05-05 20:00:10] East Siret Street | I thought of the pain Steven was feeling now, which made Steven recall his old worries about Michael, and the sadness he felt in Sunrise when Robert wasn't in his room at night, as well as the melancholy passages from Christopher's novel.\n[1898-05-05 20:00:15] East Siret Street | I saw Steven heading toward the hotel, and I thought to myself, \"It's been fourteen days since I last saw Edward.\" I thought that only for Steven would fourteen days seem long, because whenever it came to Edward, Steven always measured time in seconds. Steven's longing for Edward had gone beyond mere sighing in the wind; even the mathematical measure of time became painful, yet poetic.\n[1898-05-09 09:58:30] Hotel | When Steven arrived at the hotel, I mustered my courage and asked Peter, \"Just asking, have you heard anything from Willowbrook?\" I heard him say, \"Yes,\" as he answered Steven, his face looking unhappy, \"unpleasant news.\"\n[1898-05-10 10:06:26] Hotel | I know that Steven found out he had quarreled with his mistress, perhaps by letter, or perhaps she had come once, taking the early train and leaving on the late one. I thought about how when Steven realized that it was he who had something troubling, and when he received news about his mistress, Steven finally felt relieved. But Steven immediately realized that an unpleasant consequence of these messages might be that he probably wouldn't be able to take Steven to his aunt's house for a while now.\n[1898-05-10 10:06:31] Hotel | I knew that Peter was suffering deeply inside because of the rift in his relationship with his mistress. I thought about him when he was alone, thinking of nothing else but his mistress. His mistress remained silent, which finally drove him to the point of losing control. He even began to suspect that she might be hiding in East Ciply or had gone to India.\n[1898-05-10 10:06:36] Hotel | I thought that some people say silence is a form of power; from another perspective, when it is used by someone dear, silence can become a terrifying force. It increases the longing of the one who waits. How cruel it is to endure the silence of the one you love! It is even more unbearable than keeping silent yourself!\n[1898-05-10 10:06:41] Hotel | I remember once he went to Steven's and was so exhausted he fell asleep for a while. Suddenly he started speaking again, he wanted to run, he wanted to stop something from happening, shouting loudly, \"Steven heard her voice, you don't... you don't...\"\n[1898-05-14 10:38:05] Hotel | I saw him tell Steven that he had just had a dream, in which he was in the countryside, at the home of the major. Peter guessed that there was a very wealthy and very bad captain hiding in his house, a captain who was very much in love with his girlfriend. \"I can't believe Steven's dream is so silly!\" he said again, still out of breath.\n[1898-05-14 10:38:10] Marcel's Room | I saw that on these harsh days, he came to see Steven every day, distracted and vacant-eyed. I thought of those days, one after another, which, in Steven's eyes, seemed like a row of crooked, beautiful, solid iron bars, behind which Peter stood, wondering what decision his girlfriend would make.\n[1898-05-14 10:38:15] Marcel's Room | I knew she had finally written to ask for his forgiveness. As soon as he realized that the rupture had been avoided, he immediately saw all the disadvantages that came with reconciliation. I thought, but his heart felt much more at ease; he almost wished to accept the new pain. Since they could reconcile, then let them reconcile.",

Steven would definitely return to Willowbrook for Easter.\"\n[1898-05-25 12:05:37] Marcel's Room | \"I heard, 'By then Steven wouldn't be able to visit Edward, because Steven was going to Riverside. Well, if he can't, he can't; it doesn't matter much.'\"\n[1898-05-25 12:05:42] Marcel's Room | I heard him say, \"She was rough only because she was too straightforward and had such a devoted heart. In fact, her soul was very noble. You can't imagine how delicate and poetic her feelings were. Every year she went to Bruges in Belgium for the Day of the Dead. Isn't that 'good'?\" I thought that if Steven heard his story, he might form a bad impression of his mistress, so I added.\n[1898-05-25 12:05:47] The hotel in East Sirel | I saw that during dinner, Steven was wracking his brains. I thought of Steven trying to find an excuse that would allow Peter to ask his aunt to receive Steven before he arrived in Willowbrook.\n[1898-05-25 12:05:52] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought of the excuse by which Steven had finally succeeded: Steven had met the great painter George in Riverside, and now Steven wanted to see his paintings again.\n[1898-05-25 12:05:57] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought that although an excuse was indeed an excuse, it also had a certain degree of truth.\n[1898-05-25 12:06:02] The Hotel in East Sillé | I know that Steven once visited George. I thought that at the time, his paintings were meant to lead Steven to understand and love a reality even more beautiful than the painting itself.\n[1898-05-25 12:06:07] The hotel in East Sillé | I thought of, for example, the genuine sight of melting snow, a real square in the provinces, women on the beach who seemed vividly alive.\n[1898-05-25 12:06:12] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought that Steven had once believed that the most he could do was to depict for Steven a reality like the winding paths through hawthorn bushes, which could not be fully appreciated, not to preserve it for Steven, but to help Steven discover its beauty.\n[1898-05-25 12:06:17] The hotel in East Sirel | I thought that, but now it was exactly the unique style and allure of these paintings that aroused Steven's desire, especially his wish to see George's other works.\n[1898-05-25 12:06:22] The Hotel in East Sillé | I thought that, in Steven's view, even his least successful work was original and unconventional when compared to the masterpieces of greater painters.\n[1898-05-25 12:06:27] The Hotel in East Sillé | I thought that Steven believed his work was like a closed kingdom, with insurmountable boundaries and unique content.\n[1898-05-25 19:00:50] The Hotel in East Sillé | Every time there was a magazine like that, Steven would eagerly collect them. I know that it's rare for a magazine to publish an article on George.\n[1898-05-25 19:01:10] The Hotel d'Eastchel | I knew from those articles that Steven hadn't been painting landscapes and still lifes for long; he had started his artistic career with mythological subjects.\n[1898-05-25 19:01:30] A hotel in East Sirel | I know that Steven was fortunate enough to see two photographs of mythological paintings in his studio, and from then on, he was influenced by Japanese art for a long time.\n[1898-05-25 19:01:45] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw that in a cottage in LeSande, he kept his most beautiful landscape painting. I knew his paintings came in various styles, and the most distinctive ones were scattered in the provinces.\n[1898-05-25 19:01:50] An hotel in East Sillé | I thought of this painting as a small village in Matthew's country, with brilliant stained glass set into a grindstone, which seemed extremely precious to Steven and would stir in him a strong desire to travel.\n[1898-05-25 19:01:55] The Hotel in East Sillé | I thought that Steven, the collector, must have paid thousands of francs for this masterpiece, and he, like an astrologer, remained reclusive, dwelling in his humble cottage by the roadside.\n[1898-05-25 19:02:00] The hotel in East Sillé | I thought of Steven imagining he was posing all sorts of questions to one side of the world's mirror—the painting by George.\n[1898-05-25 19:02:05] The hotel in East Sirel | I thought that Steven felt a sense of spiritual communion and shared interest that connected him to this person, an emotion that arises between people who agree on some important matter.\n[1898-05-25 19:02:25] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew, but in one of Steven's magazines there was an article mentioning that the three important works of the painter Steven loved might be in Edward's house.\n[1898-05-25 19:02:35] The Hotel at East Sillé | I saw that at the dinner table, in front of his friends, Steven could sincerely and unexpectedly ask him. I knew, therefore, on the evening when Peter told Steven that his girlfriend was going to Bruges.\n[1898-05-25 19:02:40] The hotel in East Sillé | I heard, \"Steven said, can I? Or is it the lady Steven talked about before? This is the last time we'll talk about her. Do you remember George, the painter Steven met in Riverside?\"\n[1898-05-25 19:02:45] The Hotel at East Sillé | \"I heard, 'What's wrong? Of course I remember.'\"\n[1898-05-25 19:02:50] The Hotel at East Sillé | I heard, \"Do you remember that Steven admired him?\"\n[1898-05-25 19:02:55] The Hotel d'Estoril | I heard, \"Remember, and the letter that the Marceaux had someone deliver to him.\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:00] A hotel in East Criqueville | \"I heard, 'Well, this is one of the reasons Steven wants to get to know the lady we were just talking about (you certainly know who it is, right?), not the most important reason, just a minor one.'\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:05] The Hotel in East Sillé | I heard, \"Yes! What a lot of interjections!\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:10] A hotel in East Criqueville | I heard, \"Because she has a painting by George in her house, at least one very beautiful painting.\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:15] The Hotel in East Sillé | \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven doesn't know?'\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:20] The hotel in East Sirel | \"I heard that 'George will definitely be in Riverside for Easter, you know he's almost always there these days. Steven really wants to see the painting before leaving for there.'\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:25] The hotel in East Sillé | I heard, \"Steven doesn't know whether you and your aunt get along well. Can't you ask her—can't you speak well of Steven in front of her, try to get her to accept Steven's request—let Steven go alone—because you can't be there— to see the painting?\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:30] The hotel in East Sirel | I heard, \"What else needs to be asked? Steven guarantees she'll agree. It's all on Steven.\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:35] The Hotel in East Sillé | \"I heard 'Peter, Steven loves you so much!'\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:40] The Hotel d'Estoril | I heard, \"It's good that you like it; it would be even better if you called Steven 'you,' as you promised and have already started doing.\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:45] The Hotel d'Estoril | \"I heard someone say to Steven, 'I hope you're not planning to leave so soon, Steven,' a friend of Peter said. 'You know, even if Peter takes a vacation, it's fine—there are Stevenes around.'\"\n[1898-05-25 19:03:50] The Hotel d'Est-Ciel | I heard, \"This may be less enjoyable for you, but the Stevenes will do their best to make you forget that he isn't with you.\"\n[1898-05-26 17:43:44] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew it, just as everyone had thought that Peter's girlfriend would have to go to Bruges alone, it was reported that Unknown_Borodino had changed his mind and allowed Peter, a warrant officer, to take leave in Bruges, and the leave was quite long.\n[1898-05-26 17:44:04] The Hotel at East Sillé | I know it was like this: Unknown_Borodino's thick hair was his pride, and he was a regular customer of the most famous barber in town.\n[1898-05-26 17:44:24] The Hotel at East Sillé | I knew that this barber had once been an apprentice to the barber of Napoleon III.",

    "text": "[1898-05-26 17:44:44] The Hotel d'Estoril | I knew that Unknown_Borodino got on well with him, because although he often acted so self-important, he was actually quite approachable toward the bourgeoisie.\n[1898-05-26 17:45:04] The hotel in East Sillé | I know, but the prince had at least five years of unpaid debts at the barber's.\n[1898-05-26 17:45:24] The Hotel at East Sillé | I knew about Portuguese perfume, Guerlain perfume, curling irons, razors, strops for sharpening razors, and shampoos or hairstyles, which kept adding to the Prince's debts.\n[1898-05-26 17:45:44] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that the hairdresser would be even more concerned about being paid on the spot, and there was also Peter who came by carriage.\n[1898-05-26 17:46:04] The Hotel in East Sillé | I took the opportunity of the enthusiastic barber shaving the prince to tell him about the matter. I knew the barber had learned that Peter was in a bad mood because he couldn't go to Bruges with his mistress.\n[1898-05-26 17:46:14] The hotel in East Sirel | I saw the prince with his head tilted back, not daring to move, afraid of having his throat cut by the razor. I saw the prince wrapped in a white hospital gown.\n[1898-05-26 17:46:24] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw a young man's romantic adventure, as recounted by the barber, draw a smile from the captain-prince. I thought that was a Bonapartist kind of lenient smile.\n[1898-05-26 17:46:29] The Hotel in East Sillé | I thought that, of course, he probably didn't think about his debt, but what the barber said could make a Samuel angry or make him feel generous.\n[1898-05-27 18:46:41] An hotel in East Sillé | I saw that his chin was still covered with soap, yet he granted the leave, and ordered Peter to depart that very evening.\n[1898-05-27 18:46:51] The Hotel d'Estoril | I knew that as for the barber, he was usually a bragger, and to brag one had to lie, to embellish oneself with strange lies, but this time was an exception.\n[1898-05-27 18:47:11] The Hotel d'East Sirel | I saw that he had done Peter a great favor, not only keeping silent about his own contribution but never mentioning it to Peter again. I thought that vanity was about lying, and once there was no need to lie, vanity turned into humility.\n[1898-05-27 18:47:16] The Hotel d'Estoril | I knew that Peter's friends told Steven that no matter how long Steven stayed in East-Elie, or when he came back, if Peter wasn't there, his carriage, his house, and his spare time were all at Steven's disposal.\n[1898-05-27 18:47:36] The Hotel d'Estoril | I thought of Steven, who felt that these young people, eager to use their luxuries and youthful energy to help Steven overcome his weaknesses.\n[1898-05-27 18:47:41] The hotel in East Sirel | \"I heard, 'After all, why don't you come every year? Don't you also find the charming life here makes you happy? You even seem like a veteran, interested in everything that happens in the company.'\" I knew that Peter's friends had pleaded with Steven to stay and then said.\n[1898-05-27 18:47:46] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw them calling Steven a veteran. I knew that because Steven was still eagerly asking them to classify the officers whose names he knew according to their merits and abilities, just as he had once done in middle school, when he had asked his classmates to line up the actors of the Comédie-Française.\n[1898-05-27 18:47:56] The Hotel at East Sillé | I saw that if Peter's friend spoke of a general who was always the first to be mentioned when Steven was involved (like General Gallifet or Negrier, for example), he would say: I heard \"Négrier, he's the most mediocre general there is.\"\n[1898-05-27 18:48:01] The Hotel d'Estoril | I saw him then throw out a new, perfect and fascinating name, such as General Bong or General Cheslan de Bourgogne, and Steven would feel both surprised and delighted. It was the same feeling I had once had when seeing the names of Durendel or Fabuful, which had long been in decline, suddenly driven out by a name so unknown yet now so renowned—Amory.\n[1898-05-27 18:48:06] The Hotel d'Estoril | \"I heard, 'Ah! Even more extraordinary than Negrier? In what way? Please give Steven an example.'\"\n[1898-05-27 18:48:11] The hotel in East Sillé | I thought about how Steven wanted them to make a clear distinction between the officers in the group, even including the junior officers. Steven wanted to see how they differentiated between the officers, in order to grasp the criteria for judging the quality of soldiers.\n[1898-05-27 18:48:16] The Hotel in East Sillé | I thought of the officer named Unknown_Borodino, one of the few men in whom Steven was most interested and most willing to listen to discussions about, since Steven had the most opportunities to meet him.\n[1898-05-27 18:48:21] The Hotel d'Estoril | I know, but although Peter and all his friends acknowledged that this handsome officer managed his cavalry squadron with remarkable, unparalleled success, none of them liked him.\n[1898-05-27 18:48:41] The Hotel in East Sillé | I knew, of course, that they still distinguished Monsieur de Paul from some officers of military origin who were Freemasons, those who remained solitary, had little contact with others, and maintained the rough exterior of noncoms.\n[1898-05-27 18:49:01] An hotel in East Sillé | I knew it, but seemed not to include him among the officers of noble birth.\n[1898-05-27 18:49:21] An hotel in East Sillé | I know, but honestly, even in his treatment of Peter, he was quite different from other aristocratic officers.\n[1898-05-27 18:49:41] The Hotel d'Estoril | I knew that those aristocratic officers knew that Peter was still just a lowly noncom, and they would be pleased if they invited him to dinner (otherwise, his powerful family wouldn't have deigned to notice them).\n[1898-05-27 18:50:01] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw that when a high-ranking official who might be useful to the young lieutenant came to visit their house, they would not miss the opportunity to invite Peter to the dinner.\n[1898-05-27 18:50:11] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that Unknown_Borodino was the only exception; he maintained only a professional relationship with Peter, and a very good one at that.\n[1898-05-27 18:50:31] The hotel in East Sirel | I knew that the prince's grandfather had been made a marshal and Duke Samuel by Emperor Napoleon, and had subsequently married into the royal family; later, my father also married a cousin of Napoleon III, and he served twice as a minister after the coup.\n[1898-05-27 18:50:51] The Hotel d'Estoril | I thought that he still felt looked down upon by Peter and the Fairhaven set.\n[1898-05-28 19:50:28] The hotel in East Sirel | I knew that since he was not of the same mind as Peter, he in turn looked down on them.\n[1898-05-28 19:50:48] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew he also knew that, despite his family connection to the Hohenzollerns, Peter did not consider him a true aristocrat, but rather the grandson of a country gentleman.\n[1898-05-28 19:51:08] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that in turn he thought Peter was nothing special, since his father's countship had been confirmed by Emperor Napoleon (people in the Saint-Germain district called it a reconfirmed countship).\n[1898-05-28 19:51:28] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that he had obtained a governorship from the emperor, and later applied for another position, but it was far below that of Prince Unknown_Borodino, the Minister of State; he had to obey his orders and address him as \"Your Excellency\" in his letters.\n[1898-05-28 19:51:48] The hotel in East Sillé | I know that this Unknown_Borodino is the emperor's nephew, perhaps even closer than that.\n[1898-05-28 19:52:08] The Hotel at East Sirel | I knew that it was said that the first Princess Unknown_Borodino had accompanied Napoleon I into exile on Elba, and thus had won the emperor's favor; the second princess had won the affection of Napoleon III.\n[1898-05-28 19:52:28] The Hotel d'Estoril | I saw that even if the captain's calm face did not exhibit the natural facial features of Napoleon I, it at least revealed the same affected dignity; and his melancholy yet kind eyes and long mustache made one think of Napoleon III.\n[1898-05-28 19:52:43] A hotel in East Sillé | I knew he was so remarkably similar to Napoleon III that an amusing incident occurred: after the Battle of Sedan, he asked to be imprisoned in the same cell as Napoleon III.\n[1898-05-28 19:53:03] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw him being taken to Unknown_Bismarck, and the Prussian chancellor immediately refused, just like he refused all other requests.",

    "text": "[1898-05-28 19:53:13] A hotel in East Criqueville | I saw him, but occasionally he looked up at this young man who was about to leave, and suddenly realized he looked very much like Napoleon III. I was stunned, and so I changed my mind, called him back, and agreed to his request.\n[1898-05-28 19:53:18] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that Unknown_Borodino was unwilling to approach Peter and the other men from the Saint-Germain circle in the regiment (yet he often invited two charming junior officers of common birth).\n[1898-05-28 19:53:38] The Hotel at East Sillé | I knew this was because he considered himself an emperor and looked down on his subordinates, dividing them into two categories.\n[1898-05-28 19:53:58] The hotel in East Sillé | I know that for the self-aware subordinates, he is pleased to be close to them, because although he appears severe on the surface, his nature is actually gentle and open-hearted.\n[1898-05-28 19:54:18] The Hotel at East Sillé | I know that for other underlings who considered themselves superior to others, he rarely associated with them; he could not stand their arrogance.\n[1898-05-28 19:54:38] The Hotel at East Sillé | I knew that, despite all the officers in the regiment being attentive and warm toward Peter, Unknown_Borodino, having received some favor from a marshal, was also courteous to Peter at work (and Peter truly had no fault in this regard), but he never invited him into his home.\n[1898-05-28 19:54:58] The Hotel in East Sillé | I know there was only one exception, when he invited Peter out of necessity, and conveniently Steven was staying in East Tilloy; he asked him to take Steven along as well.\n[1898-05-28 20:00:00] An hotel in East Sillé | That evening, I saw Steven looking at Peter and the captain at the table. I thought of Steven, who effortlessly distinguished between two kinds of nobility--the old nobility and the new imperial nobility--by their respective manners and elegant bearing.\n[1898-05-28 20:00:05] The Hotel in East Sillé | I thought that the old nobility had not exercised real power for at least a century, and they no longer regarded the politeness of social interaction—the protective veil provided by education—as anything serious, but rather as something like horseback riding or fencing, done purely for amusement, without any serious purpose.\n[1898-05-28 20:00:10] The Hotel d'Estoril | I thought about how they looked down on common people, not wanting to be warm with them in case they became too pleased, and not wanting to be familiar with them in case they felt honored.\n[1898-05-28 20:00:15] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought of Peter, who came from an old noble family, his blood infused with the flaws of the old nobility, and despite all his intelligence, he had not been able to completely eliminate them.\n[1898-05-28 20:00:35] The hotel in East Sillé | I know that if someone introduced him to a commoner, even someone whose name he had never heard of, he would greet him warmly, shake his hand, and chat with him (legs crossed, switching them frequently, head tilted back, hands on his knees, adopting an air of careless, unpretentious ease), calling him \"dear.\"\n[1898-05-28 20:00:40] The hotel in East Sillé | I thought the opposite: the various titles of the new nobility still had meaning, and their heirs continued to enjoy undiminished the vast wealth their fathers had received for their services. This hereditary property reminded one of their high positions, the many people they commanded, and the various distinguished individuals they knew.\n[1898-05-28 20:00:45] The hotel in East Sillé | I thought that Unknown_Borodino came from the new nobility, and he regarded his social standing as a real privilege, even if he was not consciously aware of it, at least it was clearly expressed through his manner and appearance.\n[1898-05-29 22:02:41] A hotel in East Sillé | I know that Peter might pat the shoulders of common people and take them by the arm, while Unknown_Borodino would speak to them with a warm but dignified manner.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:01] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw that his tone was both amiable and marked by a pretentious arrogance. I thought that Steven's dignified seriousness weakened the genuine warmth contained in his natural smile.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:06] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought, of course, because he was closer to the embassy and court than Peter, and his father had held the highest position there.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:11] The Hotel d'Estoril | I thought of Peter's careless way of resting his elbows on the table and holding his feet in his hands, a posture that would certainly not be appreciated at court.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:16] The hotel in East Sirel | I thought the more important reason was that he did not look down on commoners as Peter did, because commoners were an inexhaustible reservoir of talent for the new nobility. The first emperor drew his marshals and nobles from among them, and the second found Fuld and Rœu there.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:21] The hotel in East Sirel | I knew that Monsieur de Unknown_Borodino, as a descendant of the emperor, had nothing else to do but command a cavalry squadron; he had no goals to strive for, and certainly the things that his father or grandfather had always cherished could not all be stored in his mind.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:41] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought, but just as an artist, after finishing a sculpture, continues for years to shape it in his mind, similarly, the things that had preoccupied Unknown_Borodino's father had become a part of his body, taking on a concrete form; his facial expression precisely reflected these worries.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:46] A hotel in East Criqueville | I saw that when he reprimanded a private, his impulsive voice reminded one of the first emperor; and when he exhaled a mouthful of smoke, his contemplative and melancholy expression brought to mind the second emperor.\n[1898-05-29 22:03:51] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw the gleam in his eyes as he walked through the streets of East Clichy, wearing civilian clothes and peering out from under his round felt hat. I saw the surrounding of this captain glowing with the radiance of an anonymous king.\n[1898-05-29 22:04:01] The Hotel in East Sillé | I saw how the corporal, when he entered the sergeant's office with the soldier and quartermaster, would make the sergeant tremble with fear in his legs. I thought that these two attendants were as much like Bessières and Masséna as two people could be.\n[1898-05-29 22:04:06] The hotel in East Sirel | I saw the way he fixed his gaze on the noncom tailor when he was choosing the fabric for his squad's trousers. I thought of what was enough to defeat Talleyrand and confuse Alexander.\n[1898-05-29 22:04:11] The hotel in East Sillé | I sometimes saw him, while he was inspecting the household affairs, suddenly stop and let those wonderful blue eyes take on a thoughtful expression. I thought that it was as if a new Prussia and a new Italy were being plotted.\n[1898-05-29 22:04:16] The Hotel in East Sillé | I saw it, but he would immediately revert back to Napoleon I, pointing out that the soldiers' backpacks weren't shiny enough, or tasting their rations.\n[1898-05-29 22:04:21] The Hotel d'Estoril | I know that in his private life, if he invited the wives of civilian officers (of course, they were not Freemasons) to dinner at home, he would not only set out a set of Sèvres porcelain in a pale blue shade, only fit for an ambassador to use (a gift from Napoleon to his James).\n[1898-05-29 22:04:41] The Hotel d'Estoril | I thought that if this set of tableware were placed in his country house on the banks of the Maye, it would be even more precious. Just as tourists visiting a lively manor that had been converted from an old castle would admire some rare porcelain placed in a crude wardro be all the more.\n[1898-05-29 22:04:46] The hotel in East Sillé | I know, and I must also display the other gifts of the emperor: his noble and charming demeanor, his affectionate gestures, his amiable expression, his graceful manner, and that mysterious yet piercing gaze--treasures passed down by the emperor to future generations.\n[1898-05-29 22:05:06] The hotel in East Sirel | I saw that the radiant image was preserved in those blue enamel-like eyes. I thought that if one were to believe those people who say a person's origin should not subject him to the most unjust discrimination for life, then Captain Paul's dignified appearance would certainly be a source of admiration in some diplomatic position.\n[1898-05-29 22:05:11] The Hotel d'Estoril | I know that regarding the prince's relationship with commoners in East Sigye, it is necessary to mention the following: the major played the piano very well, and the military doctor's wife sang beautifully, as if she had won first prize at the Conservatory of Music Drama.",

Steven's coming to his house makes him especially happy, besides, he's a true friend of the Stevenes.\"\n[1898-05-29 22:06:16] The hotel in East Sillé | I know that later, Monsieur de Paul was transferred to Beauvais (this was the result of his long efforts to be closer to Willowbrook), and when he moved, he completely forgot about these two couples of musicians, just as he had forgotten the theater in East-Clair and the small restaurant where he often ordered lunch.\n[1898-05-30 23:06:33] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that what especially enraged the major and the surgeon was that, despite being regular guests at the prince's table, they had never again heard from him.\n[1898-05-30 23:06:53] The Hotel d'East Sirel | I saw, one morning, Peter confess to Steven that he had written a letter to Steven's grandmother, informing her about Steven's situation and suggesting that she speak with him by phone, since telephone service had now been established between East-End and Willowbrook.\n[1898-05-30 23:07:03] The hotel in East Sillé | I knew that, in any case, Steven's grandmother was going to call Steven that day, and she had told him to go to the post office at a quarter to four.\n[1898-05-31 02:31:37] Post Office | I knew that in that era, the telephone was not yet as common as it is today. I thought that habit, which only needs a little time, could easily remove the sacred power that Steven first experienced, so that when Steven saw the phone wasn't connected right away, he felt the wait was too long and the whole thing too inconvenient.\n[1898-05-31 02:31:42] Post Office | I thought of Steven, who was almost about to complain, for at that time, Steven's mood was the same as everyone's now, annoyed that the suddenly appearing, wondrous scene was taking too long.\n[1898-05-31 02:31:47] Post Office | I thought that the person Steven wanted to talk to would soon appear right beside Steven, even though he couldn't be seen, he was really there.\n[1898-05-31 02:31:52] Post Office | I thought of him, staying in the city where he lived (for Steven's grandmother, it was Willowbrook), sitting at his table, where the sky was different from the one over Steven's place, and the weather might be different too. His situation and thoughts were completely unknown to Steven, but he would soon tell them all to Steven.\n[1898-05-31 02:31:57] Post Office | I thought of the moment when, just as the Stevenes felt like having him appear, he (and the atmosphere around him) was suddenly taken hundreds of miles away, to the ears of the Stevenes.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:02] Post Office | I thought of Steven and his kind as if they were characters in a fairy tale, with a witch who, according to their wishes, would suddenly appear before them—either their grandmother or their fiancée—but always very distant, in the place where they really lived, reading, crying, picking flowers, so clear, so real, it was almost unbelievable.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:07] Post Office | I saw that all it took for a miracle to happen was to press my lips against the magical little metal plate and call out—and sometimes I had to wait a long time, but Steven was willing— the goddess on duty. Every day, the Stevenes heard their voices, but never saw their faces. I thought of them as the guardian angels of Steven, watching carefully over the dizzying dark door.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:12] Post Office | I saw the Stevenes call upon the all-powerful goddess, who brought their loved ones near them, but did not let them see their loved ones. I thought of Steven and his kind calling upon the invisible Danaides, who never cease, emptying and filling the box of sound, passing it along.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:17] Post Office | I saw the Steven calling theFuries who mocked and took revenge, and when the Steven were telling their girlfriends heartfelt secrets and didn't want to be overheard, they would shout angrily: I heard \"Steven is listening!\"\n[1898-05-31 02:32:22] Post Office | I thought of these telephone operators as mysterious, irritable waitress, as nuns who could be heard but never seen, suspicious and full of secrets!\n[1898-05-31 02:32:27] Post Office | I heard Steven's cries just beginning, in this darkness full of ghosts, where only Steven's ears were attentively listening. A faint sound—a abstract sound—eliminated the distance—Steven's beloved's voice was speaking to Steven.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:42] Post Office | I saw it was her, the sound of her voice speaking to the Stevenes. This voice was right beside me! Yet it was so far away! I thought how many times Steven would become suddenly sad as he listened, as if even after traveling very far, the people of Steven's world could never meet the person whose voice lingered in their ears.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:47] Post Office | I thought how disappointing it was that the Stevenes, caught in this thrilling exchange between lips and ears, at the very moment when they seemed within reach of embracing the woman of their hearts, were actually thousands of miles away from them.\n[1898-05-31 02:32:52] Post Office | I thought this real voice was close to the Stevenes, but in fact it was very far away! It might even foretell a permanent separation!\n[1898-05-31 02:32:57] Post Office | I thought of those times when Steven heard a voice but couldn't see the person speaking from afar, and then he would feel it was a desperate cry rising from an abyss, and a wave of melancholy and worry would well up in Steven's heart.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:02] Post Office | I thought of Steven, who had once experienced a kind of sorrow: when a single voice, the voice of a body that Steven might never see again, came once more to his ear, whispering secretly, and yet Steven longed to kiss the words from the speaker's lips, only to find those very lips already turned to dust. At such moments, the sorrow would press so heavily on Steven that he could barely breathe!\n[1898-05-31 02:33:07] Post Office | Oh, I saw! That day in East Anglia, the miracle didn't happen. When Steven arrived at the post office, Steven's grandmother had already called.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:12] Post Office | I saw Steven enter the telephone booth, but the line was busy; someone was talking, obviously unaware that no one was answering him. I saw that when Steven picked up the telephone, it was as if the wood itself spoke in a high-pitched voice, like the hunchbacked clown in a puppet show.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:22] Post Office | I saw Steven put it back in its place, and it went silent. But when Steven picked it up again, it started talking again, like a hunchbacked clown, chattering endlessly.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:32] Post Office | I saw Steven was helpless, so I just hung up the phone and stopped touching it. This talking piece of wood finally stopped convulsing, and even until the very last second, it kept muttering.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:42] Post Office | I saw Steven go to the post office employee, who told Steven to wait a moment; then Steven spoke; at first there was no sound, but suddenly Steven heard a voice.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:52] Post Office | I thought that Steven must be familiar with this voice, but it was not so, because before, when David spoke to Steven, Steven always listened while looking at her mouth and the large eyes on her face, and today was the first time Steven had heard her voice alone.\n[1898-05-31 02:33:57] Post Office | I thought that because of this sound, everything had become something else, and Steven felt it had changed. When it came to Steven's side without the accompanying lines of a face, Steven found it filled with tenderness.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:02] Post Office | I thought to myself that it might never have been as gentle as it is today! Perhaps Steven's grandmother felt sorry for Steven, who had left home, and thought she could finally express her feelings to him.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:07] Post Office | I thought of her, and in general, this female educator always adhered to \"principles,\" controlling herself so that such feelings would not show.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:12] Post Office | I heard the voice, which was gentle but also melancholy. I thought of this feeling of melancholy as first being caused by tenderness, because it was clear and pure, almost entirely free from any impurity, and all harshness, selfishness, and incompatibility with others had been completely washed away. Human voices rarely reach such purity.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:17] Post Office | I saw that voice, so excessively considerate that it seemed fragile, ready to shatter at any moment and dissolve into a string of pure tears.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:22] Post Office | I thought to say something, but this voice, now appearing alone beside Steven without the mask of a face, was something Steven first discovered filled with sorrow, and the sorrow of her entire life had already caused cracks in her voice.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:27] Post Office | I wondered, was it only because Steven had heard the sound in isolation that this heart-rending new feeling arose? No.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:32] Post Office | I thought that, more precisely, the loneliness of sound seemed to remind Steven of human loneliness—the loneliness of his grandmother (her first separation from Steven). The loneliness of sound was a symbol and direct result of human loneliness.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:37] Post Office | I thought about how, normally, Steven's grandmother was always directing Steven to do this or that, forbidding him from doing this or that. Theannoyance of obedience and the impulse to resist canceled out Steven's tenderness for her, but now all of that had vanished without a trace, and would never return in the future.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:42] Post Office | I heard (because Steven's grandmother no longer wanted Steven to return to her side, to be under her control anymore. She was telling Steven that she hoped he would just stay in East Cisy and not come back, and if that wasn't possible, then at least stay as long as he could, which would be good for his health and his writing).\n[1898-05-31 02:34:47] Post Office | I thought that, in addition, what Steven felt under the earpiece was the mutual tenderness of the two Stevenes. This tenderness had freed itself from the opposing forces it usually had to contend with, and now became irresistible, causing Steven to be deeply moved and filled with emotion.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:52] Post Office | I thought of David asking Steven to stay, and this very idea made Steven long for her and feel an urgent need to return to her side. Steven had never imagined that she would agree to his staying.\n[1898-05-31 02:34:57] Post Office | I thought that from then on, Steven was free. But Steven suddenly felt this freedom was filled with sadness, as if, when Steven loved her, she had suddenly left Steven forever.\n[1898-06-01 07:01:23] Post Office | I saw Steven shouting, \"David, David.\" Steven longed to embrace her, but beside him there was only that ghostly voice, the same invisible and intangible spirit of his David who had come to visit him since her death.\n[1898-06-01 07:01:33] Post Office | I saw \"Talk to Steven!\" but just then, the voice suddenly disappeared, and Steven became even more lonely.\n[1898-06-01 07:01:43] Post Office | I saw David couldn't hear Steven anymore; she hung up the phone, and the Stevenes no longer stood face to face, no longer hearing each other speak.\n[1898-06-01 07:01:53] Post Office | I saw Steven continuing to grope in the dark, shouting for David, but Steven felt that even his calls to her seemed to have lost their direction. Steven was consumed with worry.\n[1898-06-01 07:01:58] Post Office | I thought back to long ago, when Steven was still a child. One day, lost in the crowd, Steven had suddenly become worried when he could no longer find his grandmother. That distress was less because he couldn't find her, and more because Steven felt she was looking for him, aware that she was thinking of him and searching for him as well.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:03] Post Office | I thought of how Steven and others feel that same heart-wrenching anxiety when speaking to people who will never answer them again: how much Steven longs to tell them the things he never said in the past, how much he wants them to know that he is safe and sound, free from illness and pain!\n[1898-06-01 07:02:08] Post Office | I thought that Steven must have felt she had become a beloved spirit, and that just now he had failed to hold her back; she had vanished among the other spirits.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:13] Post Office | I saw Steven alone, standing in front of the telephone, calling out again and again, in vain: \"David, David,\" just like Orpheus, all alone, repeating the name of his dead wife.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:23] Post Office | I saw Steven decide to leave the post office and go back to the hotel to find Peter, telling him that Steven might receive a telegram urging him to return, and he wanted to check the train schedule.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:28] Post Office | I thought about it, but before making up his mind to leave, Steven had intended to make one last appeal to the daughter of the night, the messenger, the faceless goddess; however, the fickle goddess on duty was no longer willing--or perhaps powerless--to open the magical door for Steven.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:33] Post Office | I thought that perhaps, according to custom, they had also repeatedly and tirelessly turned to the venerable inventor of printing, calling upon the young prince who loved Impressionist art and worked as a driver (he was the nephew of Unknown_Borodino), but Gutenberg and Wagram ignored their pleas.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:38] Post Office | I saw that Steven knew, no matter how much he begged, the invisible goddess would remain unmoved, so Steven left the post office.",

    "text": "[1898-06-01 07:02:43] The hotel in East Thiré | I saw that after returning to Peter and his friends, Steven did not tell them the truth—that his heart was no longer with them, nor did he say that he had already made up his mind to leave them.\n[1898-06-01 07:02:48] The Hotel in East Sillé | I saw Peter seemed to believe it, but Steven knew that from the very beginning he had understood Steven's hesitation was not feigned; he knew that he would not be able to find Steven the next day.\n[1898-06-02 08:04:35] The Hotel d'East Sirel | I saw his friend leave the food on their plates to grow cold as they both looked up the train schedule, figuring out which train Steven could take back to Willowbrook.\n[1898-06-02 08:04:45] The Hotel in East Sillé | I heard the locomotive's whistle shrieking through the cold night sky studded with stars. I thought, but Steven was now in a turmoil, unbalanced.\n[1898-06-02 08:04:50] The Hotel d'Estoril | I thought how many serene nights Steven must have spent here, with the friendship of his friends and the distant sound of a train's long whistle!\n[1898-06-02 08:04:55] The Hotel at East Sillé | I thought that even tonight, they were still serving Steven, though in a different way.\n[1898-06-02 08:05:00] The hotel in East Sillé | I thought that when Steven realized he was no longer the only one worrying about Steven's departure, and when Steven felt that his energetic friends—colleagues of Peter—and other strong friends—the train—were fully mobilized to help with Steven's departure, Steven felt much more at ease.\n[1898-06-02 08:05:05] The Hotel at East Sirel | I know that the train runs daily between Easterville and Willowbrook, in the morning and evening. I thought, looking back on it later, that the endless rolling of the wheels crushed Steven's condensed, unbearable longing for his grandmother, shattering it into the faint hope that he might return home every day.\n[1898-06-02 08:05:10] The hotel in East Sirel | \"I know Steven believes you're telling the truth, and yet you still haven't decided to leave,\" Peter said to Steven with a smile. \"But still, be ready to go. Come say goodbye to Steven early tomorrow morning, otherwise Steven might not see you.\"\n[1898-06-02 08:05:15] The Hotel in East Sillé | I heard that Steven was going into town for lunch, and the captain had given him leave. Steven had to be back in the barracks by two o'clock because his unit had training all day. That was fine; the gentleman at whose house Steven was eating would have a carriage bring him back to the barracks on time. His house was three kilometers from here.\n[1898-06-02 19:00:10] The hotel in East Sillé | I saw Peter had just finished speaking when someone came to the hotel where Steven was staying, asking Steven to go to the post office to take a call. Steven ran there because it was about to close.\n[1898-06-02 20:36:21] Post Office | When I saw the post office clerk answering Steven, they all said, \"long distance call.\" I thought Steven was extremely uneasy in his mind, because the call was from David. The post office was about to close.\n[1898-06-02 20:36:26] Post Office | I saw the phone finally connect. I heard, \"Is that David?\"\n[1898-06-02 20:36:31] Post Office | \"I heard, 'Yes, but how come Steven can't recognize your voice?'\" I heard a voice with a strong English accent answer Steven.\n[1898-06-02 20:36:36] Post Office | I knew, besides, she never used \"you\" when addressing Steven. I thought that Steven couldn't tell whether the person speaking to Steven was his grandmother.\n[1898-06-02 20:36:41] Post Office | I thought the mystery was finally solved: it turned out that the young man David was looking for was almost named Steven, and he was also staying in the same hotel where Steven was staying.\n[1898-06-02 20:36:46] Post Office | I knew that on the same day Steven had also intended to call David. I thought of someone calling for Steven to answer the phone, and Steven was convinced it was her.\n[1898-06-02 20:36:51] Post Office | I know that the mistake at the post office and the hotel was entirely a coincidence.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:00] East Sillé | I saw that the next morning, Steven was dragging his feet as he went to look for Peter. I knew he had gone to the nearby castle for a banquet.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:05] East Sillé | I thought about one and a half o'clock when Steven was preparing to go to the camp to take his chances, so that I could say goodbye to him when he came back.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:15] The shady avenue leading to the barracks | I saw, on a tree-lined road leading to the barracks, Steven seeing a light carriage coming back from behind.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:25] The tree-lined avenue leading to the barracks | I saw that when the carriage drew near Steven, Steven stepped aside for it. I saw that the driver was an officer wearing a monocle, none other than Peter.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:40] The tree-lined avenue leading to the barracks | I saw him sitting next to the friend who had invited him to dinner; Steven had met him once at the hotel in Peter.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:45] The tree-lined avenue leading to the barracks | I saw that Steven had seen Peter alone, so I didn't dare to call him, but Steven still wanted him to stop and give Steven a ride, so he waved at him forcefully. I thought of the gesture people make when they are in the presence of strangers, and Steven wanted to catch his attention.\n[1898-06-03 08:00:50] The tree-lined avenue leading to the barracks | I thought that Steven knew Peter was nearsighted, but Steven was convinced that as soon as he saw Steven, he would certainly recognize Steven.\n[1898-06-03 08:01:00] The tree-lined avenue leading to the barracks | I saw that he had seen Steven greeting him, and he had returned the greeting, but he didn't stop.\n[1898-06-03 08:01:10] The tree-lined avenue leading to the barracks | I watched him speed away, raising my hand to my hat brim for a full two minutes, as if returning the salute of an unknown soldier. I saw his facial expression frozen, without a single trace of a smile.\n[1898-06-03 14:50:04] Campsite | I saw Steven running toward the camp, but the road was still long, and when Steven reached there. I saw that the cavalry squadron had already assembled in the courtyard.\n[1898-06-03 14:50:14] Campus | I saw that they wouldn't let Steven stay in the courtyard. I felt deeply distressed at the thought of Steven being unable to say goodbye to Peter.\n[1898-06-03 17:06:47] Military barracks | I saw Steven go upstairs to his dormitory to look for him, but he was already gone. I saw Steven seeing a group of patients standing by the window watching the cavalry line up, as well as a few new recruits who had been exempted from drill, an old soldier, and that young bachelor.\n[1898-06-03 17:06:57] Military barracks | I saw Steven step forward to ask them. I heard, \"Haven't you seen Sergeant Peter?\"\n[1898-06-03 17:07:02] Military Barracks | I heard, \"Sir, he has already gone down.\" I knew what the old soldier said.\n[1898-06-03 17:07:07] Barracks quarters | I heard \"Steven didn't see it.\" I knew the young licentiate said.\n[1898-06-03 17:07:12] Barracks quarters | I saw the old man leave Steven aside and no longer pay any attention to him. \"I heard him say, 'Didn't you see? Didn't you see that famous Peter of Steven's? He's wearing brand-new pants, he's really handsome! The fabric of an officer! Captain will definitely want him!'\"\n[1898-06-03 17:07:17] Military barracks | \"I heard, 'What! The officer? Don't joke around!\" I knew that the young ensign, because of his illness, was staying in his room instead of attending the drill, and was trying to chat with the veterans, but he always felt a little uneasy inside.\n[1898-06-03 17:07:22] Barracks Quarters | I heard, \"So the officer you were talking about is like this, then?\"\n[1898-06-03 17:07:27] Barracksdormitory | I saw the \"veteran\" who had mentioned the officer get angry. \"I heard 'Sir?' \"",

    "text": "[1898-06-03 17:07:32] Military barracks | I knew he was very angry that Peter's trousers didn't convince him of the man's military background. But he was Breton, raised in a small village called Bonjour-les-Dunes, and learning French was as difficult for him as learning English or German.\n[1898-06-03 17:07:52] Military barracks | I saw him, when excited, repeat \"sir\" two or three times, as if to give himself time to find the right words. I knew that after some preparation, he would start delivering his long-winded speeches, which were really just a repetition of a few words that he had mastered better than others, but he remained calm and careful, taking great care not to make any pronunciation mistakes.\n[1898-06-03 17:08:02] Military Barracks | I saw him continuing, angry and increasingly so, speaking more and more slowly. \"I heard 'What! Is it this one? When Marcel told you about the officer, when—Marcel—told—you—this—because—Marcel—knows—this. We wouldn't be bragging.\"\n[1898-06-03 17:08:07] Military Barracks | \"I heard 'Ah! So that's the way it is.'\" I thought the young candidate was thoroughly convinced by his reasoning.\n[1898-06-03 17:08:12] Barracks Quarters | I heard someone say, \"Look, isn't that the captain coming? No, look at Peter, see how his legs move, and the way his head is tilted—does he look like a noncom? And the monocle, oh, how stylish it is to swing it around!\"\n[1898-06-03 17:08:17] Military barracks | I saw Steven being ignored as the soldiers talked among themselves, so I begged them to let Steven also look through the window.\n[1898-06-03 17:08:22] Military Barracks | I saw that they hadn't said no, but they also didn't move.\n[1898-06-03 17:08:32] Military barracks | I saw Steven seeing Unknown_Borodino ride past on horseback, proud and majestic, full of vigor and authority. I thought he must have been hallucinating, as if he were actually present at the vast and tumultuous Battle of Austerlitz.\n[1898-06-04 11:20:30] Campsite | I saw several pedestrians gathered at the camp gate, watching the cavalry regiment ride out.\n[1898-06-04 11:20:45] Campus | I saw Unknown_Borodino sitting straight on his horse, his round, plump face full-cheeked, bearing the look of a king's good fortune, with clear and bright eyes.\n[1898-06-04 11:21:00] Campsite | I thought of him as if he had entered a wondrous vision, like Steven, who whenever the tram passed by, and the deafening sound of its wheels was replaced by silence, would experience a kind of illusion, faintly hearing beautiful, melodic vibrations pass through the still air, tracing ripples in the sky.\n[1898-06-04 11:21:05] Journey | I was very upset to see that Steven hadn't been able to say goodbye to Peter, but Steven still left. I thought about how Steven just wanted to get back to David as soon as possible.\n[1898-06-04 11:21:10] Journey | I thought about how, since Steven had come to this small town, whenever Steven missed his grandmother and imagined what she was doing alone, the image that appeared in Steven's mind was still the grandmother who had been with Steven, except that Steven had erased himself completely, never once considering how much pain his absence must be causing her.\n[1898-06-04 11:21:15] Journey | I thought that now, Steven longed to return to her arms, to rid himself of the unexpected ghost that had suddenly been summoned by her voice and was now tormenting him.\n[1898-06-04 11:21:20] Journey | I thought of it as the ghost of an old grandmother who had truly separated from Steven. Steven was experiencing for the first time that his grandmother was old.\n[1898-06-04 11:21:25] Journey | I thought of her all alone, at the mercy of fate, staying in an empty room—the very room where Steven had imagined Robert was alone when he went to Riverside for his cure—just having received a letter from Steven.\n[1898-06-04 20:27:21] Parlor at Norpois's home | Oh, I saw him! When Steven suddenly entered the living room (Steven had not informed David beforehand). I saw at once the very specter. David was reading.\n[1898-06-04 20:27:31] Parlor at Paris | I saw Steven standing in the drawing room (more accurately, Steven had not yet entered the drawing room, because she had not yet noticed Steven). I saw Steven seeing her lost in thought, pondering questions that had never been revealed to Steven.\n[1898-06-04 20:27:41] The living room at Paris's home | I thought of her as if she were secretly doing some sewing, and when someone came in, she would immediately hide it.\n[1898-06-04 20:27:46] Parlor at Norpois's home | I thought only Steven was the witness, only Steven the spectator, Steven in his traveling clothes, Steven the outsider, the photographer, coming to take a photo of a place I would never see again in this life.\n[1898-06-04 20:27:51] Parlor at Home in Paris | I thought it was a privilege, even though it would vanish in an instant, to catch a glimpse of what had happened during the time Steven was away, the moment he returned home.\n[1898-06-04 20:27:56] Parlor at Home in Paris | I thought of the moment when Steven suddenly saw his grandmother, and indeed, Steven's eyes seemed to take a photograph at that instant.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:01] París living room | I thought about how Stevens always process the sight of a beloved person through a long, tender emotional transformation, an eternal movement of sentiment. Before the face of a loved one can leave an image in Steven's mind, sentiment first draws the image into a vortex, merging it with the images already present in Steven's mind, blending them into one.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:06] Parlor at Norpois's home | I thought that since, in Steven's imagination, David's forehead and cheeks reflected her most frequent and subtle feelings deep within her mind, since every habitual glance had a certain charm and every beloved face was a mirror of the past, how could Steven then see his David's increasingly dull and aged image?\n[1898-06-04 20:28:11] Parlor at Paris | I thought that, after all, Steven's eyes reflected Steven's thoughts; in life, even the most trivial scenes would be treated by Steven's eyes as if they were a classical tragedy, disregarding anything irrelevant to the plot and retaining only those images that made the story clear and comprehensible.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:16] Parlor at Home in Paris | I thought that if the Stevenes didn't use their eyes, but instead used some purely material object, like a camera, to see things, then what they would see in the courtyard of the French Academy, for instance, wouldn't be an academician leaving the courtyard to call a cab, but rather the academician's cautious, wobbly gait, the parabola he made when he fell, as if he were drunk or as if the ground were covered with a thin layer of ice.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:21] Parlor at Home in Paris | I thought that, if occasionally Heaven played a cruel joke on Steven and his kind, preventing their flexible and devout tenderness from hiding the things that must never be seen by Steven, but instead allowing Steven's eyes to arrive first at the scene, acting freely, like a camera, mechanically working, what Steven would see would not be the familiar figure that Steven's tenderness clothed again and again with a precious yet false garment every day, but rather a figure that only death could reveal.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:26] Parlor at Paris | I thought that, if not for the persistent efforts of Paul to block it, the Stevenes would have already seen this figure.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:31] Parlor at Home in Paris | I thought that for Steven, David was still a part of Steven himself, and Steven had always seen her through his own mind, through a series of similar, overlapping, transparent memories. She was always the woman from some past period.",

    "text": "[1898-06-04 20:28:36] Parlor at Norpois's home | I thought of a patient who had not looked in the mirror for a long time, who only imagined what his face looked like based on an ideal image. When he suddenly saw his real reflection in a mirror, a face that was withered and sorrowful, with a large pink nose rising like an Egyptian pyramid, he would step back in horror. Steven was just like this patient.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:41] Parlor at Home in Paris | I saw Steven in the parlor of Steven's, when suddenly he noticed an exhausted, strange old woman sitting on the sofa, reading a book under the dim, heavy red light, full of worries, with a sickly face, and eyes that moved restlessly over the pages. I thought of Steven realizing that it was a living room belonging to a new world, a world of time, a world inhabited by strangers who grew old with the passage of time.\n[1898-06-04 20:28:46] Parlor at Paris | At that moment, Steven first saw his grandmother in her true, exhausted, and aged form, but only for a fleeting instant, because this image vanished almost immediately.\n[1898-06-05 13:32:43] At my home in Paris | I heard him say to Steven, \"Steven guarantees she'll agree.\" I knew that time when Steven asked Peter if he wanted to go see Edward's collection of George's paintings.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:27] At my home in Paris | I thought it was unfortunate that, in Edward's eyes, the guarantee was for him, not for herself.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:32] At Home in Paris | I thought of Steven's mind, which formed various impressions of others, and when Steven used these impressions freely, he unthinkingly guaranteed that others would agree.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:37] At Home in Paris | I thought, of course, that even at this moment, the Stevenes would take into account the difficulties caused by differences in character between others and themselves. The Stevenes would come up with one scheme or another, either tempting people with benefits, persuading them with reason, or moving them with emotion, exerting strong influence upon them, believing that in this way, people would not raise opposing views.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:42] At Home in Paris | I thought that the differences in character between others and Steven were still merely the subjective imagination of the Stevenes; these difficulties were to be overcome by the Stevenes themselves; what effective measures to take was to be decided by the Stevenes.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:47] Paris at home | I thought of certain actions that Stevens, in their imagination, had made someone else perform a hundred times, and could speak of them with ease. But when it actually came to making that person do them, it was entirely different. Stevens would encounter some unexpected, perhaps insurmountable resistance.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:52] Home in Paris | I thought the greatest obstacle was the revulsion caused by a man in love with a woman who didn't love him. This revulsion emitted a stench that was hard to eliminate.\n[1898-06-06 16:05:57] Location: at my home in Paris | I knew that during the long weeks Peter was in Willowbrook, his aunt never once invited Steven to her house to see the paintings of George. I thought that Steven had certainly written to Peter for her.\n[1898-06-14 09:54:32] Location: At Home in Paris | I knew there was another person in this house who was also cold toward Steven. That was Mark.\n[1898-06-15 12:27:16] Home in Paris | I wondered whether he thought Steven, upon returning from Eastville, should have paid his respects to him first before going home?\n[1898-06-16 14:59:54] Location: At Home in Paris | I knew that Steven's Robert had said it wasn't because of that, and had told Steven not to make such a big deal out of it. Françoise had told her that Mark was just like that, prone to suddenly become unhappy for no reason, but it never lasted long.\n[1898-06-16 14:59:59] Location: At Home in Paris | I saw that the weather had been bad for several consecutive weeks, with storms and heavy rain mixed with snow or hail. I know, but winter is almost over.\n[1898-06-27 08:00:00] Bedroom at Paris's house | I saw, but one morning, Steven heard a murmuring sound coming from the fireplace—instead of the usual howling wind that varied in strength throughout the day. I heard the sound of a pigeon that had made its nest on the wall.\n[1898-06-28 07:59:50] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought of the howling wind that troubled Steven and made him long every day for the sea.\n[1898-06-28 07:59:55] Bedroom at My Home in Paris | I saw this sound radiate a rainbow-like halo, like the first hyacinth flower suddenly opening, gently tearing open its nutrient-rich center and unfolding soft, silken, purple blossoms that sang. I thought of it as an open window, letting the warm, bright sunlight of the first sunny day flood into Steven's dark, closed bedroom, leaving him dazzled, exhausted, and drowsy.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:00] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I saw that morning, Steven suddenly realized he was humming a café tune. I thought of this little tune, which Steven might have heard the year he went to Cedarville and Oakdale, and then completely forgotten about.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:05] Bedroom at Paris's house | I thought that depending on the specific circumstances of each day, the surrounding atmosphere would have a profound effect on Steven's body, extracting from Steven's hazy memories forgotten pieces that had been registered but never yet performed.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:10] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I saw Steven lost in a dream, entranced and mesmerized, yet more awake than ever as he listened to the musician Steven playing. I thought that although Steven didn't immediately recognize the piece being played.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:15] Bedroom at Norpois's House in Paris | I thought that before Steven went to Riverside, the church there had a strong attraction for him, but when Steven arrived there, he found the church less charming than he had imagined.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:20] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought that Steven felt this was not an isolated case. In Cedarville, Parma, or Oakdale, too, Steven's imagination could not replace his eyes when looking at things. This point was very clear to Steven.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:25] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought, similarly, on a New Year's evening, as the sun set, Steven had a hallucination in front of an advertisement board, believing that certain holidays were essentially different from others.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:30] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought, but after Steven spent a Holy Week in Cedarville, his memory still associated Holy Week with the atmosphere of this flower city. Even when Easter took on the colors of Cedarville, it also gave Cedarville a touch of Easter.\n[1898-06-28 08:00:35] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought the Holy Week was still far away, but those days of Holy Week were already clearly laid out before Steven's eyes, like a farmhouse seen in the distance in the dark, illuminated by a beam of light and therefore remarkably distinct.\n[1898-07-08 17:54:32] Paris Street | I saw Steven's parents persuade Steven to go out for a walk, giving him an excuse to go out in the morning as he used to. I saw that the weather was warming up.\n[1898-07-08 17:54:42] Paris Street | I thought that Steven, out of fear of meeting Edward, had deliberately taken a break.\n[1898-07-08 17:54:47] Paris Street | I thought, but precisely because Steven no longer went out for walks, I kept thinking about it all the time, finding a reason to go out every single moment, and each reason had nothing to do with Edward.\n[1898-07-08 17:54:52] Paris Street | I thought that in this way, Steven would be able to convince himself that even if she didn't exist, Steven would still go for a walk at this time.",

    "text": "[1898-07-08 17:54:57] Location: Paris Street | I thought, alas, it would be so nice if it were really like that! For Steven, no one else would interest him except her; but for her, as long as she didn't meet Steven, she could endure meeting anyone else.\n[1898-07-08 17:55:02] Location: Paris Street | I thought of how, every morning as she walked along the street, many fools—people she considered fools—would greet her. But she thought they were trying to win her favor, or at least she could consider them as people she happened to meet by chance.\n[1898-07-08 17:55:07] Paris Street | I thought that when she was happy, she might also tell them to stop, because sometimes people need to get rid of Steven and let someone else open their heart to them, as long as it's a stranger's heart, no matter how ordinary or ugly it might be.\n[1898-07-08 17:55:12] Paris Street | I thought, but she felt angrily that what she saw in Steven's heart was still herself.\n[1898-07-08 17:55:17] Location: Paris Street | I saw that, even though Steven had other reasons to take the same route as her, when he passed by her, he still trembled as if he had committed a crime.\n[1898-07-08 17:55:22] Paris Street | Sometimes, in order not to appear too forward, Steven would force himself to return her greeting, or else just look at her with his eyes without saying a word. I thought that in this way, she would become even more annoyed, and would begin to think Steven was arrogant and ill-mannered.\n[1898-07-10 21:42:28] Paris Street | I saw that now, her dress was thinner, at least the color was lighter.\n[1898-07-10 21:42:43] Paris Street | I saw her walking along the street. I saw on the street, in front of the narrow shops that were unevenly interspersed among the old and spacious noble residences, the awnings had already been raised under the eaves of the female shopkeepers—of the butter shop, the fruit store, and the vegetable stand—as if spring had already arrived.\n[1898-07-11 23:36:11] Paris Street | I saw Steven far off, watching the woman walking slowly along the street, opening her small parasol as she went. I thought of Steven, who was surely pondering that, in the eyes of connoisseurs, she was the greatest artist of our time, and that her movements were beautiful, touching, and utterly exquisite.\n[1898-07-11 23:36:16] Location: Paris Street\n\nTranslation: Paris Street | I saw her, but she kept walking forward, wearing a violet taffeta shawl over her shoulders, desperately lifting her chest. I thought of her thin and stubborn body, which did not know the praise people secretly gave it, nor did it take into account what others thought of it; it simply did what it wanted.\n[1898-07-11 23:36:21] Paris Street | I saw her bright but listless eyes gazing absentmindedly ahead, possibly having already spotted Steven; she was biting her lip.\n[1898-07-11 23:36:26] Location: Paris Street\n\nTranslation: Paris Street | I saw Steven see her lift her muff to give a beggar a coin, or buy a bunch of violets from a flower girl. I thought of her curious expression, which was exactly the same as Steven's when he watched a great painter at work.\n[1898-07-11 23:36:31] Location: Paris Street | I saw her nod to Steven when she reached him, and sometimes she would bestow a faint smile upon Steven. I thought of myself as if, after painting a watercolor portrait of Steven, I were then inscribing a personal dedication on this masterpiece.\n[1898-07-11 23:36:36] Paris Street | I thought that, in Steven's eyes, each of her dresses was like a natural and necessary environment, a side of her inner world.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:00] Location: Paris Street | I saw her on a morning during Lent, when she was eating outside, and Steven met her. I saw her wearing a pale red velvet dress with a subtly crescent-shaped neckline. Beneath her golden hair, she had a contemplative face.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:05] Paris Street | I thought Steven was not as melancholic as usual, for the sorrowful expression on her face and the bright color of her dress seemed to form a high wall, separating her from the world, making her appear pitiable and lonely, which made Steven feel reassured and comforted.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:10] Location: Paris Street | I thought that Steven must feel that the bright red radiance of the dress symbolized her bright red heart, which he did not yet fully understand, but perhaps Steven could offer it comfort.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:15] Location: Paris Street | I thought of Edward hidden in the rippling, mysterious red velvet light, like an early Christian female saint.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:20] Location: Paris Street | I heard, \"But the street is, after all, the property of everyone! The street belongs to everyone.\" I thought, and Steven felt he shouldn't torment this martyr with his gaze. Steven was ashamed of his behavior, and Steven repeated it, but this time the words carried another meaning.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:25] Location: Paris Street | I thought of Steven, who truly admired the Duchesse de Fairhaven, Edward.\n[1898-07-13 19:00:30] Location: Paris Street | I saw her walking along this street, often drenched by rain and made as precious as the streets of an Italian city, lost in the flowing crowd. I thought of how she had drawn her secret life into the public sphere, appearing mysteriously before everyone, allowing people to touch her, like those extraordinary paintings that are freely offered for public admiration.\n[1898-07-15 11:46:17] Home in Paris | I know that after Steven stays up all night, he goes out for a walk the next morning. By the afternoon, Steven's parents always urge Steven to go to bed and try to get some rest.\n[1898-07-15 18:14:46] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought that finding sleep was simple, just a matter of habit, requiring no great effort, even no thought at all. But Steven had neither the habit of taking a nap in the afternoon, nor could he possibly do so without thinking about it.\n[1898-07-15 18:14:51] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought about going to sleep, and Steven kept thinking about falling asleep, which only made him unable to sleep; even when he did fall asleep, he was still thinking about sleeping.\n[1898-07-15 18:14:56] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I thought this was merely a faint light appearing in the murky darkness, yet it was enough to reflect Steven's insomnia into sleep; then this reflection reflected again, making Steven feel that Steven had conceived the idea of being unable to sleep while already asleep; then another new reflection cast Steven's awakening... back into a new sleep.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:01] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought of Steven, who would like to tell his friends who had come to his room that he had been asleep a moment ago, but Steven himself thought he hadn't been asleep.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:06] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I thought of the hazy, indistinct phantoms of sleep, difficult to recognize, requiring an extremely delicate and illusory sense to grasp them.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:11] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I later had the same feeling in Oakdale, Steven: the sun had already set, and the sky seemed completely dark. I thought about it, but since sight, like hearing, has a lingering effect, I could still see the image of the day even after it had grown dark, so the sky over the canal remained filled with the last gleam of light, just like an echo that lingers on.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:16] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I thought that thanks to this invisible echo, Steven saw a series of palaces draped in black velvet reflected in the gray water, as if they would never disappear.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:21] Bedroom at Paris's home | I thought about how when Steven couldn't sleep, he often imagined a seascape; this seascape blended with its medieval appearance, becoming a dream Steven frequently had.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:26] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I thought of Steven seeing the waves of the sea frozen in sleep, like a picture on stained glass, with a medieval city in the center; a river dividing the city in two.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:31] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I thought of the green sea stretching out beneath Steven's feet, bathing a church in an Eastern style and some old houses across the shore; these houses had existed since the fourteenth century, so walking toward them was like retracing history.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:36] Bedroom at my home in Paris | I thought that in this dream, nature had learned art, and the sea had taken on a medieval style; in this dream, Steven longed to achieve and believed he had achieved what was beyond his power.",

    "text": "[1898-07-15 18:15:41] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought of this kind of dream, which Steven seemed to have had many times. But since the things imagined in a dream usually belong to the past, although never seen before, they seem very familiar, so Steven thought he wasn't dreaming. Yet, on the contrary, Steven discovered that he really did often have this kind of dream.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:46] Bedroom at Norpois's House in Paris | I thought about how people become weak when they sleep, a trait that also manifests in Steven's sleep, though symbolically: in the dark, Steven cannot see his friend's face, because people sleep with their eyes closed.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:51] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought of Steven, who in his dreams endlessly defended himself, but when Steven tried to explain himself to his friend Chen, he felt his voice stuck in his throat, unable to come out, because people always speak incoherently when they're asleep.\n[1898-07-15 18:15:56] Bedroom at Paris's house | I thought Steven wanted to go over to them, but Steven couldn't move his legs, because people don't walk while they're asleep; suddenly Steven appeared before them, full of shame, because people don't wear clothes when they're sleeping.\n[1898-07-15 18:16:01] Bedroom at Norpois's house in Paris | I thought of this, so I closed my eyes, pressed my lips together, crossed my legs, and lay bare-bodied—this was the image of a sleeping person that Steven saw in his sleep, very much like those famous allegorical paintings that Matthew had given to Steven, in which Giotto had depicted the goddess of jealousy as a wicked deity with a poisonous snake in her mouth.\n[1898-07-19 19:21:49] At Home in Paris | I saw Peter arrive in Willowbrook, but he could only stay for a few hours.\n[1898-07-19 19:21:59] At Home in Paris | I heard him assure Steven that he'd never had the chance to talk to his aunt about Steven: \"Edward isn't at all likable anymore. She's not the same Edward as before—she's been ruined.\"\n[1898-07-19 19:22:04] At Home in Paris | I saw him say to Steven, genuinely revealing his thoughts. I heard, \"Steven assures you that she's not worth your concern. You're placing too much importance on her. Would you like Steven to introduce you to Steven's cousin from Poitiers?\"\n[1898-07-19 19:22:09] At Home in Paris | I said it again, not caring whether Steven was interested or not. I heard, \"She's young and smart, and she'll surely like you. She married Steven's cousin, Proust's Samuel. Steven's cousin is a nice guy, just not very bright. Steven spoke about you to his cousin-in-law. She wants Steven to bring you over.\"\n[1898-07-19 19:22:14] At My Home in Paris | I heard, \"She's much more beautiful than Edward, and younger too. She's a lovely person, you know, a good person.\" I thought this was the expression Peter had recently learned with greater enthusiasm, used to descri be someone with a gentle nature.\n[1898-07-19 19:22:19] At my home in Paris | I heard him say, \"Steven can't be called a revisionist; one should consider her circumstances. But she did say something fair: 'If Unknown_Dreyfus is innocent, then imprisoning him on Greenwood would be terrible!' Did you understand that?\"\n[1898-07-19 19:22:24] Home in Paris | \"I heard that she was very kind to her former governesses, and she firmly refused when her family wanted them to use the side staircase. Steven assures you that she's a very good person. In fact, Edward didn't love her, because she felt that the other woman was smarter than herself.\"\n[1898-07-23 17:03:17] At Home in Paris | I knew that although Françoise's entire attention was devoted to pitying a servant of the Fairhaven— a servant who couldn't even visit his fiancée when Edward wasn't at home, because the concierge would soon report it— she still felt genuinely sorry that she wasn't there when Peter came.\n[1898-07-25 00:17:00] Home in Paris | I knew she hadn't met Peter because she was also going out often these days. On any day when Steven needed her, she would definitely go out—either to visit a brother or a niece. Recently, her daughter had come to Willowbrook, and she had been going out even more frequently.\n[1898-07-25 00:17:20] Location: At Home in Paris | I felt unhappy because she wasn't there to attend to Steven, and since she was visiting her own relatives, Steven became even more angry.\n[1898-07-25 00:17:25] At home in Paris | I thought that because Steven had anticipated she would present this family visit as a matter of course, in accordance with the regulations of Saint-André Church, he would react unfairly as soon as she explained, and especially since her way of speaking was particularly irritating to him, making him even more furious.\n[1898-07-26 23:07:42] Home in Paris | I never heard her say, \"Steven went to see Steven's brother, Steven went to see Steven's niece.\" Instead, she would say, \"Steven went to see his brother, Steven ran in to say hello to the niece (or Steven's meat-selling niece).\"\n[1898-07-26 23:07:47] At Home in Paris | I knew that Françoise wanted her daughter to go back to Sunrise, but her daughter refused, affecting the manner of a refined lady and inserting some abbreviations into her speech, which sounded utterly vulgar.\n[1898-07-28 06:21:29] Home in Paris | I knew she said that Sunrise had no charm at all, and that one couldn't stand to stay there for a week. She didn't want to go to Françoise's sister's house either, which was in the mountains, and she said the mountains weren't very interesting. I thought about how, when she said those words, the word \"interesting\" took on a new and terrible meaning.\n[1898-07-28 06:21:34] In my home in Paris | I knew that Françoise's daughter couldn't bring herself to return to Méséglis, which she considered \"the most stupid place in the world.\" At the market, those gossipy women, those \"country bumpkins,\" would discover they were related to her and say, \"Why, isn't that the daughter of the late Samuel?\"\n[1898-07-29 13:35:17] At Home in Paris | I heard her say she would rather die than ever return to live there. \"Now she's tasted the life in Willowbrook,\" said Françoise.\n[1898-07-29 13:35:22] At Home in Paris | I heard that although Françoise was old-fashioned, when her daughter said, \"Hey, Robert, if you can't go out, just send Steven a pneumatic letter.\"\n[1898-07-30 20:49:00] At Home in Paris | I thought of this, and in order to please her daughter, she could not help but praise the new \"Willowbrookian girl's\" spirit of reform.\n[1898-07-30 20:49:05] Location: At Home in Paris | I saw that the weather had suddenly turned cold again.\n[1898-08-01 05:59:59] Home in Paris | \"I heard 'Going out? Where to? Want to get killed?' said Françoise.\"\n[1898-08-02 15:10:54] Paris at home | I knew that because her daughter, brother, and meat-selling niece had all gone to Sunrise this week, she preferred to stay at home.\n[1898-08-04 00:21:49] Home in Paris | I heard her add, \"Because God has not yet cooled down,\" when she spoke of this inappropriate early spring chill. I knew, moreover, that she was the last believer of Aunt Léonie's \"physical theory,\" and this theory of Aunt Léonie had some influence on her.\n[1898-08-05 09:32:43] At my home in Paris | I saw the complaints about her, and Steven simply smiled listlessly. I thought her prediction was of no interest to Steven at all, since in any case Steven would have good weather.\n[1898-08-05 09:32:48] At my home in Paris | I imagined Steven as if he had already seen the rising sun on the summit of Fiesole, radiating brilliant light. Steven was bathed in warm sunlight, feeling cozy all over; the dazzling light made Steven squint, as though smiling; his eyelids were like long-burning lamps made of white marble, glowing with a faint red light.",

Yet the daffodils, camellias, and lilies of the old bridge were pushing out tender shoots against the cold wind, like delicate flowers nurtured in clear water. I thought Steven would surely be holding flowers, celebrating the anniversary of his trip to Italy.\n[1898-08-10 22:16:16] Home in Paris | I know that once, when the Stevenes were making preparations for their trip after the end of Lent, they had a similar experience.\n[1898-08-10 22:16:21] At my home in Paris | I knew that James had said, after hearing what Monsieur A. J. Unknown_Borodino had said, that he now understood where Paul had been going when he met him at Fairhaven.\n[1898-08-10 22:16:41] Paris at home | I heard, \"He went to visit Charles. He knew her well, and Steven didn't know anything about it before. It seems that Charles is a likable woman, an extraordinary woman. You should go see her,\" I know he said it to Steven.\n[1898-08-10 22:16:46] At Home in Paris | I heard that Steven was surprised. When he spoke about Samuel, he treated him as a very refined man, yet Steven had always thought him vulgar. It was said that he was well-informed and cultivated, but in reality, he was only proud of his name and his marriage.\n[1898-08-10 22:16:51] In my home in Paris | I heard him say, \"Moreover, according to Paul, he's very influential, not just here but throughout all of Europe. It's said that the Emperor of Austria and the Emperor of Russia regard him as a friend. Old Paul told Steven that Charles likes you, and in her salon you can meet many people who will be useful to you.\"\n[1898-08-10 22:16:56] At Home in Paris | I heard him say, \"He really praised you in front of Steven. You'll meet him there, and even if you want to write a book, he could give you some advice. Steven thinks you won't do anything else in the future.\"\n[1898-08-10 22:17:01] At My Home in Paris | I heard, \"Others might think that being a writer is a promising career. Steven, for his part, never encouraged you to take this path. But now you're about to become an adult, and the Stevenes can't keep watching over you forever. Therefore, you shouldn't be stopped from choosing a profession according to your own interests.\"\n[1898-08-16 10:59:59] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought, alas, if only Steven could get to work! But no matter under what conditions Steven started writing (just as he had once decided not to drink, to take naps, to sleep well and take care of his health), the result was always a blank sheet of paper with not a single word written.\n[1898-08-16 11:00:04] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought about writing in a fervent, orderly, and enthusiastic state, or canceling, postponing, or treating walks as a reward for writing. When I was feeling well, I wrote for an hour each day; when I wasn't feeling well and had to stay home, I still used that time for writing. In short, Steven made all sorts of efforts.\n[1898-08-16 11:00:09] At My Home in Paris | I thought of it like a card trick: no matter how you shuffle the deck beforehand, in the end you're bound to draw the card the magician forces you to take.\n[1898-08-16 11:00:14] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought of Steven being led by habit, of habit not working, of habit not sleeping, of habit being unable to sleep. Habit would always prevail.\n[1898-08-16 11:00:19] Home in Paris | I thought that if one day Steven did not defy his habits, allowing the habits to find an excuse from occasional circumstances and do as they pleased, then on that day Steven would get by without too much trouble, could sleep a few more hours before dawn, read a few pages, and wouldn't drink too much.\n[1898-08-16 11:00:24] Home in Paris | I thought that if Steven defied his habits and insisted on going to bed early, forcing himself to drink only water and not wine, and forcing himself to work, then the habits would become furious and take drastic measures, making Steven sick, so that he would have no choice but to drink more alcohol, staying awake for two days and even being unable to read a book.\n[1898-08-16 11:00:29] Home in Paris | I thought, and so Steven decided that next time he would be more reasonable, which meant being even less self-controlled, like a man robbed on the road who, fearing for his life, might as well let them take everything.\n[1898-08-21 23:43:38] Home in Paris | I knew that during this time, James had met Samuel once or twice. Since Paul had told him that Samuel was a remarkable man, he paid even more attention to Samuel's words.\n[1898-08-23 08:54:32] At Home in Paris | I heard him say to Steven that she was his aunt, and he pronounced Villiers as Viller. He told Steven that she was very wise, even saying that she had a storehouse of thoughts. I knew they had just reached the subject of Charles, and James added.\n[1898-08-24 18:05:27] Home in Paris | I thought the meaning of \"thought pool\" was vague, which aroused his interest. He had come across this expression once or twice in some essay collections, but he had never assigned it a precise definition.\n[1898-08-24 18:05:32] Home in Paris | I thought of Steven, Robert, and James. Robert always showed great respect for James, so when James became interested in the idea of a mental repository in Charles, she immediately concluded that the matter was worth taking seriously.\n[1898-08-24 18:05:37] Location: At Home in Paris | I knew that she had long since learned the secrets of Charles from Steven's grandmother. I thought about it, but I still immediately took a liking to her.\n[1898-08-28 21:38:10] At Home in Paris | I knew that Steven's grandmother was in poor health, and she had initially opposed Steven's visit to Charles, but later stopped insisting.\n[1898-08-30 06:49:05] Home in Paris | I knew that since Steven's family moved into their new home, Charles had invited David several times, but she always declined by letter, saying she no longer went out.\n[1898-08-31 15:59:59] Home in Paris | I knew, though I didn't know why, she had suddenly changed her habit and no longer sealed her letters herself, but let Françoise do it instead.\n[1898-09-02 01:10:49] At Home in Paris | I thought about Steven, even though Steven couldn't imagine what this \"intellectual repository\" looked like, but if Steven had seen that old woman from Riverside sitting at a \"desk,\" he wouldn't have been surprised. And indeed, that was exactly the case.\n[1898-09-02 01:10:54] At my home in Paris | I knew that, in addition, James was planning to run for a corresponding member position at the French Academy, and he wanted to know whether Ambassador Paul's support could help him gain more votes.\n[1898-09-03 15:06:14] At my home in Paris | I knew, to be honest, that although I did not dare to doubt his support for Paul, I was not entirely sure of it either.\n[1898-09-05 05:01:33] At Home in Paris | I know that some people in the ministry have told James that Paul wants to be the only representative of the Ministry at the French Academy, and he would set up many obstacles to prevent others from being candidates; moreover, since he is currently supporting someone else, he certainly wouldn't support James.\n[1898-09-06 18:56:52] Location: At Home in Paris | I thought, but James considered it a slander against Paul.\n[1898-09-06 18:56:57] In Paris home | I knew, however, that when the distinguished economist Léonard Le Royer urged him to run for office and analyzed the chances of his election, he saw that Paul's name was not among those colleagues listed by Le Royer. I thought he was deeply shaken.",

    "text": "[1898-09-06 18:57:02] At My Home in Paris | I thought he was too afraid to go and see M. Paul directly, but he hoped that Steven's visit to Charles would bring him Paul's support.\n[1898-09-06 18:57:07] Location: at my home in Paris | I realized there was no time to lose. Paul's campaign would ensure James got two-thirds of the votes from the French Academy; moreover, the ambassador was well known for his helpfulness, even those who disliked him could not deny it.\n[1898-09-06 18:57:12] Location: At Home in Paris | I knew that, in the ministry, his protection of James was more evident than his protection of anyone else. I thought that therefore James probably considered it likely to get his support.\n[1898-09-06 18:57:17] Paris Street | I saw James meet someone else, which surprised and angered him.\n[1898-09-14 22:52:43] Paris Street | I saw him meet Madame Matthew on the street. I knew this woman lived in poverty, so she rarely came to Willowbrook, and when she did, it was only to visit a friend's house. No one was more hateful to James than Madame Matthew.\n[1898-09-16 19:07:16] Paris at home | \"I heard, 'Friend, Steven should invite Madame Matthew, she won't be here for long. Friend, according to Steven, Steven is asking you to make a big concession and visit Madame Matthew. You know Steven doesn't want to trouble you, but if you could go, Steven would be very happy.\" I know that every year, Steven and Robert gently beg James once.\n[1898-09-18 15:21:49] Location: At Home in Paris | I saw him smile, somewhat forced, but he still went.\n[1898-09-20 11:36:21] Paris Street | I saw that, although he didn't like Madame Matthew, when he saw her on the street, he still went over to her and took off his hat in salute.\n[1898-09-22 07:50:54] Paris Street | I saw that, however, to his surprise, Madame Matthew merely nodded coldly at him out of politeness. I thought that he must have done something wrong, or been sentenced to live on the other side of the world.\n[1898-09-24 04:05:22] At My Home in Paris | I saw James return home, his face full of anger and astonishment.\n[1898-09-24 04:05:27] A Salon | I saw that the next day, Steven met Madame Matthew at a salon.\n[1898-09-24 04:05:37] A salon | I saw that she didn't offer her hand to Steven or Robert, but only gave her a distracted, melancholy smile. I thought that perhaps Steven and Robert had been friends from childhood, but because of her moral decline, she had married a convict, or even worse, a man who had been divorced, and thus Madame Matthew had cut off all contact with her.\n[1898-09-25 20:55:48] A salon | I knew that before, whenever Steven's father and Robert met Madame Matthew, they were always polite to her, and Madame Matthew had always shown great respect for Steven's father and Robert.\n[1898-09-26 17:20:58] Paris | I knew Steven, but Robert didn't know where, in Sunrise, among people like the Lady of Saas, only she was a revisionist.\n[1898-09-26 17:21:03] Paris | I knew that James was a friend of M. Meller, and he firmly believed in Unknown_Dreyfus's guilt. When his colleagues asked him to sign a petition for a retrial, he turned them down flat.\n[1898-09-28 10:11:19] Paris | I knew that when he found out that Steven's way of life was different from his own, he didn't speak to Steven for a whole week. His views were well known, and people were almost starting to call him an anti-revisionist.\n[1898-09-28 10:11:39] Location: Paris | I knew that when it came to Steven's grandmother, she was the most generous in the family, and perhaps only she showed a trace of doubt.\n[1898-09-28 10:11:44] Paris | Whenever someone spoke of Unknown_Dreyfus's possible innocence, she always shook her head. No one knew what she meant by it, as if she were pondering a very serious matter and had shaken her head because she had been disturbed.\n[1898-09-28 10:11:49] Paris | I thought of Steven, Robert, who loved James wholeheartedly, yet also wished for Steven to have his own thoughts, so she was torn and decided to remain silent.\n[1898-10-01 19:52:01] Paris | I knew that Steven's grandfather revered the army (although his service in the National Guard had been a nightmare during his prime years), and in Sunrise, every time a regiment passed by the front of the house, he would remove his hat to salute the colonel and the military flag.\n[1898-10-01 19:52:21] Paris | I thought that all this would make Madame Matthew see James and my grandfather as unjust accomplices, even though she fully knew they were selfless and honorable.\n[1898-10-01 19:52:26] Paris | I thought that individual crimes could be forgiven, but participation in a collective crime could never be excused.\n[1898-10-01 19:52:31] Paris | I thought of how, when she learned that James was against the retrial, she immediately separated herself from James by several continents and several centuries.\n[1898-10-01 19:52:36] Paris | I thought that since they were separated by a thousand years in time and thousands of miles in space, James would naturally never see her greeting, and she would never think to shake his hand or speak to him, because such courtesies could not cross the distance between them.\n[1898-10-05 05:32:43] At Home in Paris | I learned that Peter was coming to Willowbrook, and he had promised to take Steven to the Charles's house. I knew he was going to have lunch at a restaurant with Steven and his mistress, and then the Stevenes would take her to the theater for a rehearsal.\n[1898-10-05 05:32:53] At My Home in Paris | I knew the Stevenes had to leave early in the morning to pick her up from her house in the suburbs of Willowbrook. I thought Steven hoped to meet Edward at the Charles house, but Steven didn't tell him about this idea.\n[1898-10-05 05:32:58] At home in Paris | I saw Steven tell Peter that it would be best to have lunch at the hotel in Émerainville. I thought of the role of restaurants in the lives of aristocratic young men who spent money like water, and how it was just as important as the chest that held silk and brocade in an Arabic folk tale.\n[1898-10-05 05:33:03] At Home in Paris | I knew that Hémé had told Steven that he was the head waiter at the hotel before the tourist season in Riverside began. I thought of Steven, who dreamed of traveling day and night but rarely left home. The idea of seeing a beach not just as a memory in Steven's mind, but as a real beach, held great appeal for him.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:17] Home in Paris | I knew that Hemme went there every year. When Steven had to stay in Willowbrook because of exhaustion or school, during those long July evenings, he would still gaze through the glass walls of the big dining room at the sun slowly setting into the sea, waiting for customers to arrive.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:22] At Home in Paris | I saw the blue, ghostly ships with their sails spread, motionless as if they were exotic night butterflies displayed in a glass case, as the sun gradually disappeared into the sea. I thought of Riverside as a powerful magnet, and Hémy, having come into contact with it, had become magnetized; in turn, he had become a magnet for Steven.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:27] At Home in Paris | I thought that Steven hoped that talking with him was like being in Riverside, experiencing the charm of travel without actually going on a journey.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:32] Home in Paris | I saw Steven leave early in the morning. When Steven departed, Françoise was still complaining endlessly. I knew that because the previous night, the engaged servant had not been able to visit his fiancée even once.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:37] At home in Paris | I saw Françoise notice him crying there. I thought about going to beat up the concierge, but held myself back, fearing I'd lose my job.",

Since the family had left Sunrise, they had not kept in touch with him.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:47] Paris Street | I saw that his hair was now white, but his expression remained young and innocent.\n[1898-10-05 10:01:52] Location: Paris Street | \"I heard him say, 'Ah! It's you,' to Steven, 'How beautiful! Oh, in a suit! Steven is used to being free and easy, he wouldn't want to wear such a suit. Well, you're probably a fashionably dressed person in society now, with a heavy schedule of visits, I suppose!\"\n[1898-10-05 10:01:57] Paris Street | I heard: \"If someone like Steven were just to go to a tomb and have a dream, this large flowered necktie and this short jacket would be just the thing. You know, Steven has always admired your noble character. How sorry he is to see you consorting with the nobility, betraying your soul.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:02] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"The atmosphere of those salons is really disgusting and suffocating in Steven's eyes. If you stay there for just a quarter of an hour, you'll ruin your career and be condemned by the prophets. Steven can see that you're very close to those 'carefree people,' moving between noble households. That's the current vice of the bourgeoisie.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:07] Paris Street | \"I heard, 'Ah, nobility! The terrible era made a great mistake by not wiping them out completely. Nobles are either complete fools or sinister villains. Well, poor child, if it pleases you, go ahead!\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:12] Paris Street | I heard: \"When you're at a salon having tea at five o'clock, your old friend is much luckier than you—he's alone, sitting in some suburb, gazing at the pink moon rising against the violet sky.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:17] Paris Street | \"I heard him say, 'In fact, Steven is hardly a person of this earth; he feels like a stranger here. Gravity must exert all its force to keep Steven from escaping to another celestial body. Steven is a man from another planet.'\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:22] Location: Paris Street | \"I heard, 'Goodbye, don't misunderstand the straightforward character of the farmers of the Vienne River—also the Danu be River. To prove to you that Steven values you, Steven will send you a copy of his latest published novel. But you won't like it.'\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:27] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"You think Steven's novel isn't corrupt enough, doesn't have the right decadent scent. It's too straightforward, too honest. You need Christopher, which you yourself admit to. People like you, who are so finicky and fastidious, need depraved literature to satisfy your dulled taste.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:32] Paris Street | I heard, \"People in your circle probably regard Steven as an old-timer. It's not worth the effort to write those books about Steven; Steven's style is no longer in fashion. Besides, the lives of the common people aren't refined enough in the eyes of the young women you like to associate with, and they wouldn't find them interesting.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:37] Paris Street | I heard, \"Well, when you have time, just think about Christ's teaching: 'Work, so that you may live!' Goodbye, friend.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:02:42] Paris Street | I wasn't too upset with him after I saw Steven part ways with Thomas. I thought that some past events seemed to be common friends of the Stevenes, able to act as mediators in between.\n[1898-10-05 10:02:47] Location: Paris Street\n\nTranslation: Paris Street | I thought of that small wooden bridge, standing amid the ruins of the feudal society, surrounded by fields of golden buttercups, which connected Steven and Thomas, just as it connected the two banks of the Viernon River.\n[1898-10-05 10:02:52] Suburbs of Paris | I saw that spring had arrived in Willowbrook, but the trees along the avenue had only just begun to sprout new buds.\n[1898-10-05 10:02:57] Suburban village | I saw the suburban train carrying Steven and Peter, the Stevenes, as they left Willowbrook, stopping at the village where Peter's mistress lived. I saw Steven and others marveling at the fruit trees, each one covered in white blossoms, like temporary white altars decorated with gardens.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:02] Suburban village | I thought of it as if it were a grand festival, when people come from far away at fixed times to admire this peculiar and poetic, fleeting local celebration. But this time, the festival was a gift from nature.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:07] Suburban village | I saw the cherry trees in full bloom, their white flowers like white corsets, mingling among the leafless, flowerless bare trees. On this still cold and clear day, from a distance they looked like patches of snow; elsewhere the snow had melted, but here, behind the bushes, some still remained.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:12] Suburban village | I saw tall pear trees surrounding houses and ordinary courtyards, their white blossoms covering the branches completely, creating an even broader, more uniform, and more dazzling world of white, as if every household in the village were simultaneously celebrating its first communion.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:17] Suburban village | I saw the villages in the suburbs of Willowbrook, where each house still had a garden from the 17th or 18th century. I knew these gardens had originally been the \"playgrounds\" of the imperial relatives' stewards and concubines. The gardeners planted fruit trees in the gardens, which were lower than the roads (perhaps they had merely preserved the layout of a large orchard from that era).\n[1898-10-05 10:03:22] Suburban village | I saw the pear trees arranged in the shape of a plum blossom, with wider spacing between them than the pear trees Steven had seen before, but the petals were more pronounced, separated by low walls that formed large white squares.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:27] Suburban village | I saw the sun leaving light, either bright or dim, along the four edges of the square, making these open-air rooms without roofs look like the sunlight one might see in Crete, Greece.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:32] Suburban village | I saw the sunlight shining variably on the different terraces, like playing in the spring sea, causing here and there a bunch of bright, fluffy white flowers to emerge, and the splashing white flowers glittered through the translucent fence of blue trees.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:37] Suburban village | I thought that, seeing this scene, people would again feel these open-air rooms resembled fishponds, or sections of sea enclosed for fishing or oyster farming.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:42] Suburban village | I saw that it was an old village. The town hall looked dilapidated. The golden brick walls had three pear trees in front of the door, serving as banners and flagpoles.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:47] Suburban village | I saw the tree as if adorned with beautiful white silk, as if celebrating a local festival.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:52] Suburban village | I saw that all along the way, Peter kept telling Steven about his mistress. I thought of Steven, who had never shown such deep affection to his mistress. Steven felt that she was the only one in his heart.\n[1898-10-05 10:03:57] Suburban village | I thought, of course, his career in the army, his position in society, and his family's opinion of him were not unimportant, but they were nothing compared to his mistress.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:02] Suburban village | I realized that his mistress was the most important person, more important than the Fairhaven family or all the kings on earth.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:07] Suburban village | I thought that Steven might not even be clear in his own mind whether his mistress was above all else to him, but he only paid attention to things related to her. With her, he was capable of joy and anger; for her, he might even have been willing to kill.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:12] Suburban village | I thought that, in his eyes, the only truly meaningful things that could move him were what his mistress wanted to do and was about to do, and the questions that occupied her mind, which he could only guess at, at best, from the expression in that narrow space beneath her forehead and above her chin.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:17] Suburban village | I had always found him to be reasonable in his dealings, yet he was now calculating to marry a daughter from a wealthy family, not for any real affection, but simply to continue supporting and keeping hold of his mistress. I thought of what it would cost someone who secretly doubted that he was doing this, and Steven believed that the cost was something no one could imagine.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:22] Suburban village | I thought he didn't marry her because, out of a pragmatic instinct, he knew that once she no longer had any expectations of him, she would leave him, at least living as she pleased. Therefore, he had to keep her forever in a state of waiting, thus firmly binding her to him.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:27] Suburban village | I thought that perhaps she didn't love him, as he suspected. Of course, this ailment called love might force him—just as it forced all men—to believe from time to time that she did love him.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:32] Suburban village | I thought that, but he was well aware that even if she loved him, it wouldn't eliminate her desire to take money from him. Once she no longer had any expectations of him, she would immediately leave him (he thought that the theories of her literary friends had ruined her, and despite loving him, she would still leave him).\n[1898-10-05 10:04:37] Suburban village | \"I heard him say to Steven, 'If she behaves well today, Steven will give her a gift, and she'll be happy. It's a necklace she saw in the store at Bousseron. It costs thirty thousand francs, which is a bit expensive for Steven's current financial situation.'\"\n[1898-10-05 10:04:42] Suburban village | I heard him say, \"But this poor little thing doesn't have much fun in her life. As soon as Steven buys it, she'll be overjoyed. She mentioned this necklace to Steven. She said she knew someone who might buy it for her. Steven didn't believe it was true, but he still made an arrangement with Brestel, the supplier from his family, to hold it for him.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:04:47] Suburban village | I heard, \"Steven is happy at the thought of seeing you. She's not perfectly flawless like a statue, you know, but she has extraordinary judgment.\" I thought Steven could see that, but he himself considered her perfect, and he said that in order to make Steven praise her more.\n[1898-10-05 10:04:52] Suburban village | I heard her say, \"She might not be very talkative in front of you, but Steven is already feeling happy just thinking about how she'll one day talk to Steven about her impressions of you. You know, what she says allows for endless imagination, almost like the Pythia of Delphi!\"\n[1898-10-05 10:04:57] Suburban village | I saw the Stevenes walking toward her house along the small garden, and Steven couldn't help but stop in his tracks. I saw that the garden was full of blooming cherry and pear trees, their blossoms glittering in the sunlight, blinding my eyes.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:02] Suburban village | I thought to myself that obviously, these gardens, which had seemed empty and desolate yesterday as if no one lived there, had suddenly been filled with many white-clad girls overnight, making them charming and beautiful.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:07] Suburban village | I saw, through the fence, these beautiful young girls in white standing gracefully at the corner of the garden path.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:12] Suburban village | \"I heard, 'Listen, Steven, since you're a poet who lingers over beautiful moments, just stay put. Steven's friend lives nearby; Steven will go get her.'\" I know that Peter said to Steven.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:17] Suburban village | I saw Steven waiting for me, and I took a walk around the area. Steven passed by several small gardens. I saw that when Steven looked up, he caught a glimpse of a young girl's figure in the window.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:22] Suburban village | I saw it right there, outdoors, by the window on the first floor, where clusters of vivid lilac flowers hung down among the leaves, dressed in their purple gowns, graceful and delicate, swaying gently in the breeze, utterly indifferent to the glances that passed through the greenery from passersby.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:27] Suburban village | I thought of this string of lilacs, which made Steven recall the sunny afternoons of spring when he had seen the lilacs hanging in profusion along the garden wall of M. Matthew, like a charming purple tapestry exuding a rich country fragrance.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:32] Suburban village | I saw Steven come along a path into a patch of grass. The wind here was cold and sharp, just like the wind in Sunrise. I saw that, in the midst of this grassland, just as fertile and moist as the land along the Véfour River, a tall, snow-clad pear tree still sprouted, just like its companions, arriving punctually for the appointment, joyfully swaying its pear blossoms toward the sun.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:37] Suburban village | I saw the pear blossoms trembling and convulsing in the cold wind, yet they were coated with a shimmering silver light, forming a tangible, touchable veil of light.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:42] Suburban village | I saw, suddenly, Peter appeared before Steven, accompanied by his mistress. I thought of this woman as the entire love of Peter, the only possible pleasure in his life. Her personality seemed to be enclosed within a shrine, arousing endless imaginations from Steven's friend.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:47] Suburban village | I saw Peter and felt that I would never truly understand her; he often asked himself, \"What is hidden behind her, behind her gaze and her flesh?\" I thought of this woman, and Steven immediately recognized her as Brian.\n[1898-10-05 10:05:52] Suburban village | I knew that a few years ago, she had told the madam of a brothel (a woman, once she changes her circumstances, does so with an astonishing speed): \"Then it's settled, Steven will be free tomorrow; if anyone comes, please don't forget to call Steven.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:05:57] Suburban village | I know that when there were really guests \"to see her,\" and she was left alone with this \"guest\" in the room, she was so experienced that, after locking the door—out of a woman's caution or out of habit—she would immediately start taking off her clothes, moving very quickly, as if a doctor were about to examine her.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:02] Suburban village | I knew that she had stopped halfway only because this \"guest\" disliked nudity, and she had been told not to take off her undergarments (like some doctors who are sensitive to sound yet also afraid of their patients catching cold, listening to their lungs and heart through their clothes).\n[1898-10-05 10:06:07] Suburban village | I thought about the woman's life, her thoughts and past, which men had possessed her body, all of which seemed so insignificant to Steven. If she were to tell Steven these things, he would listen out of politeness, but hardly pay any attention.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:12] Suburban village | I thought, but Peter worshipped her as a goddess, gave her all his love, lay awake in sorrow, endured torment, and even regarded her—what Steven saw as nothing more than a wooden doll—as the source of his infinite suffering, more precious to him than his own life.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:17] Suburban village | I thought of these two Brian's, who had nothing to do with each other (because Steven had met Brian in a brothel), and suddenly it occurred to Steven that men live for women, suffer for them, even commit suicide for them, but many of them are Brians, and their value to others is no different from Brian's value to Steven.",

    "text": "[1898-10-05 10:06:22] Suburban village | I thought about how some people approach life with a sense of curiosity and sorrow, and Steven was stunned by this. Steven could have told Peter that Brian often slept with other people; in Steven's eyes, it was nothing serious, but it would have caused Peter so much pain!\n[1898-10-05 10:06:27] Suburban village | I thought about all the things he had done just to find out with whom she had slept. In the end, it was all for nothing!\n[1898-10-05 10:06:32] Suburban village | I thought to myself that Steven realized, if a man comes to know a woman through imagination, he would imagine that behind her small face lies an infinite number of beautiful things; conversely, if he meets her in the crudest way, the things he longs for might break down into insignificant, meaningless material components.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:37] Suburban village | I thought to myself that Steven realized, in Steven's eyes, a woman he paid twenty francs for at a brothel was nothing more than a woman who wanted twenty francs, and in fact she wasn't worth twenty francs.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:42] Suburban village | I thought, but if Steven had at the outset imagined her as a wonderful and mysterious woman, difficult to obtain and even harder to keep by his side, then she would have become an invaluable treasure, more precious than any enviable status, even more than the warmth of family.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:47] Suburban village | I thought it was interesting that Steven and Peter saw the same thin, elongated face, but Stevens approached her from two opposite roads that would never cross, and the Stevenes would never see the same face.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:52] Suburban village | I thought of this face, its look, its smile, the movement of its mouth—Steven had known it from the outside. This face was no different from that of any woman who would sell her body to Steven for twenty francs.\n[1898-10-05 10:06:57] Suburban village | I thought that the look, smile, and movements of the mouth on this face were, to Steven, merely ordinary gestures, without personality or meaning, and Steven had no interest in trying to find out which particular person they belonged to.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:02] Suburban village | I thought that, to say, what Steven had from the beginning—the face that could be touched and kissed—was for Peter a final goal. How great were his hopes, doubts, suspicions, and dreams as he approached this goal!\n[1898-10-05 10:07:07] Suburban village | Yes, I thought, for the woman who sold her body for twenty francs, Peter had paid not just millions, but far more to keep her from falling into someone else's hands!\n[1898-10-05 10:07:12] Suburban village | I thought about how he spent so much money, yet sometimes still failed, perhaps because of some unexpected situation, and the woman who had intended to give herself to him suddenly ran away, or perhaps she had another appointment, or something happened that made her particularly difficult that day.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:17] Suburban village | I thought that if she were dealing with a sentimental man, even if she wasn't aware of it, and especially if she was aware, there would be a terrible chase.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:22] Suburban village | I thought of this sentimental man, discouraged yet unable to do without this woman, chasing her relentlessly while she struggled desperately to escape. In his quest for a single smile, a smile he dared not hope to receive again, he would pay a price a thousand times greater than the cost of winning a woman's body.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:27] Suburban village | I thought that in such situations, sometimes due to a mistake in judgment or cowardice before pain, you might passionately regard a prostitute as an untouchable idol, and thus you would never be able to obtain her tenderness, never even get her first kiss, and you wouldn't even dare to ask for it, fearing that you would violate your belief in this Platonic spiritual love.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:32] Suburban village | I thought of how painful it must have been for you, not even having had the chance to taste the kiss of the woman you loved, when you left this world. But Peter was luckier; he had experienced every tender affection Brian had to offer.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:37] Suburban village | I thought, of course, that if he now knew his mistress had sold her body for a single louis to any man, he might feel an agonizing pain, but in order not to lose her favor, he would still pay her a million francs.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:42] Suburban village | I thought that because what he knew was not enough to make him return to his senses (important matters for people are often not under their own control, but governed by some natural law), he still imagined her face in a dream, and thus could not see her true face.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:47] Suburban village | I saw her thin face now motionless, expressionless. I thought of myself as a piece of paper subjected to two immense atmospheric pressures, maintained in balance by two infinite forces. Both forces converged on her, but never met, because she stood between them.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:52] Suburban village | I saw Steven and Peter both staring at her, each seeing a different mystery in her. I thought that Steven did not consider Brian particularly remarkable, but rather believed that human imagination and fantasy possessed great power, and that the pain of love was caused by human fantasy.\n[1898-10-05 10:07:57] Suburban village | I saw Peter realize that Steven was excited. Steven turned his head to look at the pear and cherry trees in the opposite garden, so that Peter would believe it was the beauty of the fruit trees that had moved Steven. I thought, and indeed, these beautiful scenes did move Steven's heart, presenting to him not only things to be seen with the eyes, but also things to be felt with the heart.\n[1898-10-05 10:08:02] Suburban village | I thought that Steven might have regarded these fruit trees in the garden as unseen angels, just as he might have misrecognized someone like Robert. On the day of Jesus' resurrection, it was also in a garden that Robert saw a figure and \"thought it was a gardener.\"\n[1898-10-05 10:08:07] Suburban village | I thought, how could these admirable young girls in white, who bend their bodies under the shade of trees suitable for napping, fishing, and reading, not be angels? These young girls preserve the memory of the golden age for Stevenes, assuring them that reality is not as beautiful as people imagine, but if Stevenes strive to be worthy of it, reality might, in return, shine with a poetic, pure, and wondrous light.\n[1898-10-05 10:08:12] Suburban village | I saw Steven and Peter's mistress exchange a few words. Steven and his companions took a shortcut through the village. The houses were dirty. I saw him, and even before the filthiest, as if scorched by acid rain, houses, there stood a mysterious traveler, staying for a day in this cursed town.\n[1898-10-05 10:08:22] Suburban village | I saw this radiant, glorious angel, spreading dazzling white wings to protect a filthy house: this was a pear tree covered with white blossoms.\n[1898-10-05 12:29:55] Suburban village | I saw Peter and Steven take a few steps forward. I heard, \"Steven wasn't planning to come here. The Stevens were waiting for her in town. Steven would even have preferred having lunch with you alone, staying alone until it was time to go to Steven's grandmother's house.\"\n[1898-10-05 12:30:00] Suburban village | \"I heard, 'But that poor girl, how much she wanted Steven to come and pick her up! She was so good to Steven, you know, Steven couldn't refuse her. Besides, she'd be pleasant company—she has a literary talent and is very emotional. And it's very pleasant to have lunch with her at the hotel. She's so lovely, so down-to-earth, always satisfied with everything.'\"\n[1898-10-05 12:30:05] Suburban village | I thought, but Steven believed that that very morning, perhaps for the only time, Peter had momentarily freed himself from the woman he had slowly constructed through a series of tender impressions, and suddenly saw another Brian standing not far away, identical in appearance to his Brian, yet a completely different person—a silly little prostitute.",

    "text": "[1898-10-05 22:37:25] Station | After leaving the pleasant orchard, the Stevenes went to catch the train back to Willowbrook. At the station, Brian walked ahead of the Stevenes, a few steps away.\n[1898-10-05 22:37:35] Train Station | I saw, suddenly, two other vulgar \"hens\" like her recognized her. Thinking she was alone, they started shouting noisily. \"I heard, 'Is that you, Brian, coming with Steven and the others? Lucienne and Chimène are already in the car, there's still a seat available. Come on, go skating with Steven and the others.'\"\n[1898-10-05 22:37:40] Train Station | I saw them about to introduce their lovers—two \"department store clerks\" standing beside them—to her, when I noticed Brian looking slightly uneasy. Curious, I glanced aside and spotted the Stevenes. I quickly apologized and said goodbye to her.\n[1898-10-05 22:37:50] Train Station | I saw her say goodbye to them as well, a bit awkward but very friendly. I knew they were two pitiful little hens, the scarf was made of fake mink. When Peter first met Brian, she was about the same age.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:00] Train Station | I thought that Peter didn't know them, nor did he know their names. Seeing how closely they were connected to his mistress, I suddenly felt suspicion: his mistress might have once led, and perhaps still led, a life that was hidden from view, a life completely different from both his and hers, a life of selling her body for a single louis.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:05] Train Station | I thought that not only did he vaguely see this life, but also vaguely saw another Brian, an unfamiliar Brian, a Brian like those two hens, a Brian worth twenty francs.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:10] Train Station | I thought that, in the end, he felt Brian had split in two, and beside his Brian he faintly saw the little chicken Brian, the real Brian— if one could say that the chicken Brian was more real than the other Brian.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:15] Train Station | I thought that at this very moment, Peter might be thinking that he had intended to make a deal by using his noble lineage, marrying a wealthy girl so he could continue to support Brian with ten thousand francs a year. Now it seemed there was no longer any need for that. He could easily escape from the hell of his current life by spending just a little money to please his mistress, just like those two shop assistants who had bought the favor of those two prostitutes for very little money.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:20] Train Station | What could I do? She had no fault at all. He gave her too little money, and her enthusiasm for him would fade; she wouldn't anymore whisper those sweet words that drove him wild.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:25] Train Station | I knew that in order to show off, he often read his mistress's letters to his colleagues, letting them know how tender she was, but never revealing how much he spent supporting her. I thought that no matter what she gave him--a dedication on a photo, or the final polite words in a telegram--these simplest and most precious forms of language were all transformed into money.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:30] Train Station | I thought that even if he didn't mention that Brian's rare displays of tenderness were bought at a high price, the Stevenes couldn't possibly think he was acting out of pride and vanity, although this simple and one-sided reasoning is often absurdly applied to all lovers who support women financially and to so many husbands.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:35] Train Station | I thought Peter was no fool. He knew that all the pleasures which satisfy vanity could be easily obtained by him, without cost, thanks to his noble birth and handsome face; on the contrary, his ambiguous relationship with Brian could only distance him from the upper class and make him less valued in people's eyes.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:40] Train Station | I thought of his desire to show, without spending a penny, the tender affection he had won from his lover—that was nothing more than a byproduct of love, a need to demonstrate to himself as well as to others that he was deeply loved by the one he cherished.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:45] Train Station | I saw Brian walking toward Steven and the others, and the two women also got into the car. I thought of Lucienne and Sylvie, whose names, like their fake mink scarves and the affected mannerisms of department store clerks, briefly sustained the image of the new Brian.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:50] Train Station | I thought that at this very moment, Peter imagined Willowbrook as a life of the Place de l'Étoile, with unfamiliar friends, dirty money, and aimless afternoons of pleasure; he seemed to feel that the sun on the streets connecting the Champs-Élysées was no longer as bright and radiant as when he used to walk there with his mistress, because love, along with the inevitable suffering that goes with it, can make Steven's senses more refined, just like sobriety after drunkenness.\n[1898-10-05 22:38:55] Train Station | I thought of how he imagined there was another city within Willowbrook; he felt that being with Brian was like exploring a life he knew nothing about, even though when Brian was with him, she seemed like his equal, since their shared life was indeed a part of her real life, even its most precious part, because he gave her an endless amount of money, which could make her girlfriends envious, and also enable her, one day, to save enough to retire to the countryside or join the big theater.\n[1898-10-05 22:39:00] Train Station | I thought Peter had wanted to ask her who Lucienne and Sermane were, and what they might tell her if she went to their compartment. I thought about how she would spend the day with her girlfriends. He imagined that, if he and Steven weren't there, they might go to the Olympia Hotel for some more sophisticated entertainment after ice-skating.\n[1898-10-05 22:39:05] Train Station | I thought that for a moment, the Hotel Olympia and everything around it—which he had always hated—aroused in him both curiosity and pain; the bright springtime on Comte de Martel Street stirred up a faint sense of nostalgia. If Brian had not known him, she might have gone there later to earn a louis d'or.\n[1898-10-05 22:39:10] Train Station | I thought, but what was the point of asking these questions of Brian? There was no need to ask—he already knew that her answer would either be silence, or a lie, or something that didn't explain anything but would only bring him pain. The two Brians lasted a long time.\n[1898-10-05 22:39:15] Train Station | I saw the conductor about to close the door, and Steven's group hurriedly boarded a first-class compartment. I thought of Brian, surrounded by jewels, which made Peter feel once again that she was an invaluable treasure.\n[1898-10-06 02:20:10] Train compartment | I saw him caressing her, then fitting her into his heart, silently gazing at her within himself, just as he had always done—except for the moment when he first saw her on the Place de Bessières—when the train started moving.\n[1898-10-06 02:20:20] Train compartment | I saw that she indeed had a bit of \"literary talent.\" She talked endlessly to Steven about books, about the new art and Tolstoyism, only pausing occasionally to scold Peter for drinking too much.\n[1898-10-06 02:20:30] Train compartment | \"I heard, 'Ah! If you could live a year with Steven, just wait, Steven would only let you drink water, and you'd be better off than you are now.'\"\n[1898-10-06 02:20:35] Train compartment | \"I heard 'A deal is a deal, Steven, they've gone very far away.'\"\n[1898-10-06 02:20:40] Train Carriage | \"I heard, 'But you know Steven has a lot to do. Besides, what will your family say?'\" I knew because she took the art of drama very seriously.\n[1898-10-06 02:20:45] Train car | I saw that she then began to bitterly criticize Peter's family in front of Steven. Steven felt her rebuke was entirely justified, and Peter completely agreed with her view, but he still disobeyed her command, continuously drinking champagne.\n[1898-10-06 02:20:50] Train compartment | I thought Steven also believed that drinking was bad for him, and he felt that her influence on him wasn't bad at all; Steven was ready to persuade him not to pay any attention to what his family said.",

However, at least his children would have a clean reputation. But the thought of his suffering makes Steven terribly sad. Can you believe it? Unknown_Marsantes, a kind-hearted woman, actually said that even if he were innocent, he should remain on Greenwood. Isn't that terrible enough?'\"\n[1898-10-06 02:21:20] Train Carriage | I saw Peter confirm it. I heard, \"Yes, that's right, she did say that. She's Steven's Robert, and Steven can't argue with that. But there's one thing Steven is willing to say: she isn't as compassionate as Brian.\"\n[1898-10-06 02:21:25] Train compartment | I thought of Peter telling Steven that having lunch with Brian was \"very pleasant.\" But in reality, lunches of this kind always ended in disappointment.\n[1898-10-06 02:21:30] Train compartment | I thought about how, whenever Peter was with his mistress in public, he would start to imagine all sorts of things, feeling constantly that her eyes were lingering on other men, which would make him gloomy; she would notice his bad mood and might tease him, thereby making it even worse.\n[1898-10-06 02:21:35] Train compartment | I saw, but more often, because the way Peter spoke hurt her silly pride, she deliberately pretended not to want to relieve his worries, pretending to stare intently at this or that male customer; besides, it wasn't always an act.\n[1898-10-06 02:21:40] Train compartment | I thought, indeed, that whenever they went to the theater or a café, if the person sitting next to them—perhaps even the coachman of their hired carriage—showed the slightest bit of elegance, jealousy would send a signal to Peter, and he would notice that person before his mistress did; he would immediately regard that man as a scoundrel, that sort of morally corrupt womanizer he had spoken to Steven about in Riverside.\n[1898-10-06 02:21:45] Train Carriage | I thought of him begging his mistress not to look at that man, which would in fact be a reminder to her.\n[1898-10-06 02:21:50] Train compartment | I saw that sometimes, when she detected in Peter's suspicion a touch of appreciation, she would finally stop teasing him, let him feel reassured, and agree to run errands for her, giving her time to exchange a few words with the stranger, often arranging a meeting, and occasionally even managing to steal a tryst.\n[1898-10-06 05:40:39] Hotel | I saw the Stevenes arriving at the hotel, and as soon as Steven arrived, he noticed Peter looking worried. I saw him enter and immediately noticed Hemme standing among his ordinary colleagues, looking radiant and polite. I knew that none of the Stevenes in Riverside had noticed it.\n[1898-10-06 05:40:49] Hotel | I saw Hemme naturally exuding the romantic aura that people with light hair and a Greek nose inevitably develop after several years.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:04] Hotel | I saw that his colleagues were all old and repulsive, like the hypocritical parish priest or the pious penitent pretending to be devout. I thought that precisely because of this, he stood out among the servants.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:09] Hotel | I thought they were more like old-fashioned comedians, with foreheads as smooth and round as a cu be of sugar. One could only see such comedians playing servants or high priests of ancient Northgate in small theaters with few spectators, in lounges displaying faded photographs of old plays, and only in these photos did one see such foreheads.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:14] Hotel | I thought this hotel had been carefully chosen, or perhaps it was preserving tradition by keeping all the solemn patterns of the comedians.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:19] Hotel | I was sorry to see that it was Emma who recognized the Stevenes, and she came over to give them a bill, while the high priests of the operetta went to other tables.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:24] Hotel | I saw Hemme ask Steven about his grandmother's health, and Steven told him about the well-being of his wife and children.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:29] Hotel | I saw him introduce Steven with great emotion. I saw that he looked intelligent, full of energy, and polite in his manner. I knew because he was a man with strong family values.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:39] Hotel | I saw Peter's mistress begin to gaze at him intently. I saw that Emile's sunken eyes were deeply set in a face devoid of expression, revealing no reaction. His slight myopia made his gaze appear inscrutable and impassive.\n[1898-10-06 05:41:49] Hotel | I knew that before he went to Riverside for work, he had spent many years serving in a provincial hotel, where his handsome appearance—now pale and tired—had not attracted much attention.\n[1898-10-06 05:42:09] Hotel | I know that year after year, he always stood in the same place, at the far end of the almost deserted restaurant, like a copper engraving of Prince Eugène. Because no one recognized the high artistic value of his face, he remained unaware of it.\n[1898-10-06 05:42:29] Hotel | I knew that he was by nature cold-hearted and disliked being in the spotlight. At most, only one or two Willowbrookian ladies passing through would occasionally stay at his hotel, notice him with a glance, and invite him to their room before she left by train.\n[1898-10-06 05:42:49] Hotel | I knew that, in this quiet, vague, monotonous, and profound emptiness of a good husband and a provincial servant, a secret had been deeply buried—one that no one would ever come to expose here.\n[1898-10-06 05:43:09] Hotel | I saw that the actress's unchanging gaze could not have gone unnoticed by Hemme. Peter could not have failed to see it either.\n[1898-10-06 05:43:14] Hotel | I saw Steven's face flush with a red cloud, but it was not the deep red of his usual outbursts; it was a pale, sparse blush.\n[1898-10-06 05:43:24] Hotel | After seeing Peter rudely send Emile away, he asked his mistress. I heard, \"Brian, this waiter is quite interesting, isn't he? It seems as if you want to make a study of him.\"\n[1898-10-06 05:43:29] Hotel | I heard, \"Look, here he comes again! Steven had already guessed it!\"\n[1898-10-06 05:43:34] Hotel | \"I heard 'What now, Steven's little darling? Even if Steven was wrong, Steven didn't say anything, never mind. But Steven does have the right to make you watch out for this scoundrel; Steven knew him from Riverside (or may be Steven doesn't care at all). He's a first-rate rascal, the likes of which the world has never seen.\"\n[1898-10-06 05:43:39] Hotel | I saw that she seemed willing to listen to Peter's advice and began talking to Steven about literature, and Peter joined in as well.\n[1898-10-06 05:43:49] Hotel | I thought that talking about literature with her was not boring for Steven, because she was familiar with the works that Steven greatly admired, and her evaluations of those works were roughly similar to Steven's.\n[1898-10-06 05:43:54] Hotel | I knew that Steven had once heard Charles say that Brian was poorly educated. I thought that, therefore, Steven didn't value her refinement so much anymore.\n[1898-10-06 05:43:59] Hotel | I saw that she was clever and witty, always laughing and chatting, and she would use jargon no matter what she talked about. I thought that if she didn't constantly provoke people with the jargon of the literary club and the painting studio, she would be a likable woman.\n[1898-10-06 05:44:04] Hotel | I saw, for example, that she had a habit of saying: I heard, \"Ah! That's great.\"\n[1898-10-06 05:44:09] Hotel | One day, I saw a young man kiss her ear, and she pretended to shudder slightly. The young man was deeply moved and acted shyly. She said to him: I heard \"Don't do that, as a feeling, Steven thinks it's great.\"\n[1898-10-06 05:44:14] Hotel | I thought of it, but what surprised Steven even more was that the expression Peter usually used (and which, moreover, was probably picked up from literati through his mistress) she used in front of him and he used in front of her, as if they were indispensable phrases, not realizing that a novel expression, once overused, becomes meaningless.\n[1898-10-06 05:44:19] Hotel | I saw her eating, and her hands were very clumsy. I thought that when she was performing on stage, she must also be as clumsy as this.\n[1898-10-06 05:44:24] Hotel | I thought of her, how she only seemed nimble and skillful when making love, with a heart-stirring kind of foresight, like those women who are passionately in love with a man and immediately know how to give him the greatest pleasure, yet their bodies were so different from each other.\n[1898-10-06 05:44:29] Hotel | When the conversation turned to theater, Steven fell silent. I thought that Brian was being a bit too aggressive on this issue.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:05] Hotel | I saw that she was defending Arthur in a compassionate tone. I knew she was diametrically opposed to Peter, which proved that she often attacked Arthur in his presence.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:10] Hotel | \"I heard, 'Ah! No, she's a remarkable woman. Of course, her performance isn't as moving as it used to be, and she doesn't quite match the expectations of the Stevenes. But the Stevenes shouldn't judge her by today's standards. She's a woman of merit.\"\n[1898-10-06 18:58:15] Hotel | I heard him say, \"She's done many remarkable things, you know. Besides, she's very upright and has a noble heart. Of course, she didn't care for the things that Steven was interested in, but she had a touching face and showed outstanding talent.\"\n[1898-10-06 18:58:20] Hotel | I saw her have to extend two fingers, more precisely, two nails, as if she were flicking off a speck of dust. I knew that when she evaluated art, she didn't just make the same finger gesture every time. If it was a painting, and she wanted to indicate it was a good one, with rich colors, all she had to do was raise her thumb. But \"outstanding talent\" required more than that.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:25] Hotel | I saw it, but apart from this exception, Peter's mistress spoke of the most renowned actors with mockery and a sense of superiority. I thought about how this made Steven angry, because Steven believed--and he was wrong on this point--that she was inferior to others.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:30] Hotel | I thought she saw it all clearly, that Steven regarded her as an ordinary actress, whereas he showed great respect for those people whom she looked down upon.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:35] Hotel | I thought she wasn't angry, because although she had outstanding talent, it had not yet been recognized; even if she was confident, she still carried a touch of inferiority.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:40] Hotel | I thought that, once again, people always judged and expected respect for Steven according to Steven's current status, rather than according to Steven's own talent, insight, or views. (An hour later, Steven would see Peter's mistress show great respect for an actor whom she had previously criticized seriously.)\n[1898-10-06 18:58:45] Hotel | I saw that, even though Steven's silence aroused some suspicion in her, she still insisted on having dinner with Steven in the evening, saying that no one else's conversation made her as happy as Steven's.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:50] Hotel | I saw that Steven and his friends were going to the theater after lunch. Although Steven and his friends were still at the hotel now, they hadn't gone to the theater yet. I thought that Steven and the others seemed to have stepped into a \"star's dressing room\" filled with old theater photographs, because the faces of the managers looked very much like those of distinguished artists; as a generation of artists disappeared, such faces seemed to have vanished as well.\n[1898-10-06 18:58:55] Hotel | I saw these foremen also looked very much like members of the French Academy: one of them was standing at a table studying a pear. I thought of his face, and of that careless and inquisitive expression, which reminded me of Monsieur de Sacy.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:00] Hotel | I saw others standing beside him, looking at the restaurant with curious and indifferent eyes. I thought of that scrutinizing gaze, which reminded me of an academician from the French Academy, who, when he arrived at a public place, would also look at the audience with curiosity and coldness, while exchanging a few hushed words.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:05] Hotel | I saw that this was the distinctive face of a church assistant priest. I thought, but then people discovered that a new priest had arrived, someone with an unusual appearance, his nose lined with wrinkles, his lips showing a hypocritical piety. As Brian put it, he was a \"phony saint.\"\n[1898-10-06 18:59:10] Hotel | I saw the customers all eagerly examining the new arrival.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:15] Hotel | I saw it, but not for long, Brian was already sending coquettish glances to a young university student sitting at the next table, who was dining with his friends. I thought perhaps she wanted to drive Peter away with this method, so she could be alone with Émeri.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:20] Hotel | \"I heard Peter say, 'Brian, please, don't look at that young man like that.'\" I saw the redness on his face, which had been just faint and scattered a moment ago, now suddenly surging up, swelling the relaxed lines of Steven's friend, growing darker in color.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:25] Hotel | I heard, \"If you really want to humiliate the Stevens in front of everyone, Steven would rather go off and eat somewhere else, then come to the theater to wait for you afterwards.\"\n[1898-10-06 18:59:30] Hotel | At that moment, someone came up to Hem and said that a gentleman wanted him to come to his car to speak.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:35] Hotel | I saw Peter was very uneasy, worried that someone might be delivering a letter to his mistress, so I looked out the window. I saw him seeing a closed carriage in which Monsieur de Charlus was seated, wearing black-striped white gloves and a flower in the buttonhole of his jacket's lapel.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:40] Hotel | \"I heard him say in a low voice to Steven, 'You see, Steven's people have even followed us here. Please, Steven can't go himself. Since you're on good terms with the foreman, go and tell him not to come to the car. He'll definitely betray Steven and his men.\"\n[1898-10-06 18:59:45] Hotel | \"I heard him say, 'No matter what, someone who doesn't know Steven has to go. If he tells Steven's uncle that he doesn't know Steven, Steven knows his uncle, and he'd never come into the café to look for Steven. He hates those places. A lecherous old man like him, constantly lecturing Steven, even coming here to spy on him, is unbearable.'\"\n[1898-10-06 18:59:50] Hotel | I saw Hemme receive instructions from Steven, and then he sent a servant off to tell M. de Charlus that Hemme couldn't come. If the gentleman was looking for the Marquis de Peter, he was to say he didn't know him. The carriage quickly drove away.\n[1898-10-06 18:59:55] Hotel | I saw that Peter's mistress couldn't hear what Steven and the others were saying, and she thought they were talking about that young university student, because Peter had just scolded her for flirting with him. She flew into a rage and began to curse violently.\n[1898-10-06 19:00:00] Hotel | \"I hear you! It's the young man's turn, isn't it? You told Steven in advance, that's good. Ah! It's so pleasant to eat under these conditions! Don't listen to him, he's a bit crazy, especially when—\"",

    "text": "[1898-10-06 19:00:05] Hotel | I saw her turn her face toward Steven. I heard him say that he acted that way because he believed that appearing jealous made one refined and gave the air of a great gentleman.\n[1898-10-06 19:00:15] Hotel | I saw her wave again and stamp her foot, looking restless and annoyed.\n[1898-10-06 19:00:20] Hotel | \"I heard 'But Brian, it should be Steven who's unhappy. You made a fool of Steven in front of that gentleman, and he must have thought you liked him. And in Steven's eyes, his looks are as bad as they can be.'\"\n[1898-10-06 19:00:25] Hotel | I heard, \"On the contrary, he was very much to Steven's liking. First of all, his eyes were fascinating, and when he looked at women, there was a special expression in them that gave one the feeling he might be very fond of women.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:00:30] Hotel | I saw Peter shouting. I heard, \"Don't say anything, not even before Steven leaves. Are you crazy? Waiter, bring Steven his clothes.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:00:35] Hotel | I thought that Steven didn't know whether to go with him or not.\n[1898-10-06 19:00:40] Hotel | I saw him speaking harshly to Steven, just as he had spoken to his mistress earlier, as if he were angry with Steven too. \"I heard, 'No, Steven needs to be alone for a while.'\"\n[1898-10-06 19:00:45] Hotel | I thought of his anger as if it were a musical phrase from an opera, used in several different passages with the same melody. Although their meanings and natures differed in the script, the musical phrase united them all in the same emotion.\n[1898-10-06 19:00:55] Hotel | After Peter left, his mistress called in Hemme and asked him a lot of questions. Then she wanted to know Steven's impression of him.\n[1898-10-06 19:01:00] Hotel | \"I heard him say, 'His eyes are interesting, aren't they? You see, Steven is interested in knowing what he would think if Steven wanted him to come often and accompany him on trips. That's all. If you love someone just because you like them, that would be terrifying.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:01:05] Hotel | I saw her watching Hemme all along. I heard, \"Peter shouldn't be imagining things. Steven's thoughts will disappear on their own in Steven's mind. Peter can be completely at ease. Look at his dark eyes, Steven wants to know what's hidden inside them.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:01:15] Hotel | I saw that soon after, someone came to tell her that Peter was asking her to go to a private room. Steven was left alone. Not long after, Peter called Steven over as well. I knew that just now, he hadn't gone through the dining room, but had instead taken another door to that private room to finish his lunch.\n[1898-10-06 19:01:25] Private room at the hotel | I saw Peter kissing her desperately, touching her. They were drinking champagne. I saw Steven seeing his mistress lying on the sofa, looking very happy and smiling broadly.\n[1898-10-06 19:01:30] Private room of the hotel | \"I heard 'Good, you!'\" I thought of how she would sometimes say it to him, because she had just learned the expression, and she thought it best conveyed tenderness and humor.\n[1898-10-06 19:01:35] Private room at the hotel | I felt uneasy seeing how little Steven ate. I thought that although Thomas's words had no effect on Steven, it was a pity that this first bright spring afternoon, which had begun in a hotel room, ended in the backstage of the theater.\n[1898-10-06 19:01:45] Single Room at the Hotel | I saw Brian looking at her watch, worried about being late for the performance, then poured a glass of wine for Steven and handed him an Eastern cigarette. She took a rose from her dress and gave it to Steven.\n[1898-10-06 19:01:50] Private room at the hotel | I thought to myself: \"Steven didn't need to complain too much about wasting the day. The few hours Steven spent with this young woman weren't entirely without reward; Steven had received a rose, a fragrant cigarette, and a glass of champagne, all given by her in good will—things you couldn't buy no matter how much money you had.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:01:55] Private room at the hotel | I thought of Steven in this way, in order to give aesthetic value to these dull hours, and thus to ease my conscience, accepting the situation with calm.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:00] Dining Room Private Room | I thought that perhaps Steven should consider finding a reason to alleviate his boredom, and this very fact was enough to prove that Steven felt no aesthetic value in those few hours at all.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:05] Private Room | I thought that as for Peter and his mistress, it seemed they had completely forgotten their earlier quarrel and even no longer remembered that Steven had been an eyewitness.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:10] Private Room at the Hotel | I saw that they didn't even mention it, neither to justify the quarrel we'd just had nor to explain the current sweet talk between Steven and Steven—how striking the contrast was!\n[1898-10-06 19:02:15] Private Room | I saw Steven drinking a lot of champagne with them, and I felt a bit drunk, somewhat like the drunkenness Steven had felt at Springfield, but not exactly the same.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:20] Private Room | I thought about the many different ways to be drunk--from the sun or from a journey, from fatigue or from drinking; drunkenness could also be measured in various degrees, just as the ocean's depth can be measured. Not only does each kind of drunkenness reveal the exact expressions of Steven's inebriation, but each level of drunkenness reveals them completely and without reserve.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:35] Private Room | I saw Peter's room was very small, decorated only with a mirror, but the mirror was extremely strange, as if it reflected thirty or so identical rooms stretching out along an infinite perspective.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:50] Private room of the hotel | I saw that at night, I turned on the electric light on top of the mirror, and from the mirror, thirty identical lights were continuously reflected.\n[1898-10-06 19:02:55] Private Room | I thought that if someone were to drink alone in this single room, even if he were completely by himself, and saw one electric light after another reflected in the mirror, he would feel his heart swell with emotion, his thoughts would wander, and he would experience many beautiful sensations, as if the space around him had also become infinitely expanded.\n[1898-10-06 19:03:00] Private room of the hotel | I saw the bright curve stretching out infinitely. I thought that although he was alone in this small room, he ruled over a space longer than the paths of the \"Willowbrook Zoo.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:03:05] Private room of the hotel | I saw that, at this moment, Steven was the man drinking. Steven went to the mirror to find this man. Suddenly, Steven saw him—a hideously ugly stranger. He was staring back at Steven.\n[1898-10-06 19:03:10] Private Room at the Hotel | I wasn't sure whether I was happy or provoking, but I gave Steven a smile, and he smiled back at me. I thought of how drunkenness made Steven feel so at ease that I no longer cared about disliking the ugly man in the mirror.\n[1898-10-06 19:03:15] Private Room in the Hotel | At that very moment, I felt Steven's experience so intensely that I no longer knew what Steven was thinking. Perhaps the only thing Steven was worried about was fearing that the hideous \"Steven\" he had just seen in the mirror would soon die, worrying that he would never again meet this stranger in the course of his life.\n[1898-10-06 19:03:20] Private room at the hotel | I saw Peter speaking, and at the same time glancing sideways at his mistress. I thought Peter was only dissatisfied that Steven did not further display his eloquence in front of his mistress.\n[1898-10-06 19:03:25] Private room of the hotel | I heard, \"Hey, the gentleman you met this morning, the one who mixes fashion with literature, you tell her about him, Steven. He doesn't remember clearly.\"",

    "text": "[1898-10-06 19:03:30] Private Room | I heard, \"But, dear Steven, besides what you just said, there's nothing more for Steven to say.\"\n[1898-10-06 19:03:35] Private Room in the Hotel | I heard, \"You really are a bore. Well, why don't you tell her about Françoise on the Champs-Élysées? That would really cheer her up!\"\n[1898-10-06 19:03:40] Private room of the hotel | I saw her take Peter's chin in her hand and pull it into the light, repeating her usual clichés. \"I heard, 'That's great! Peter mentioned Françoise to Steven many times. Hello there, you!'\"\n[1898-10-06 21:49:39] Theater | I thought that ever since Steven had come to believe that an actor was not only artistically authentic in his recitation and performance style, Steven had become interested in the actor himself.\n[1898-10-06 21:49:44] Theater | I saw Steven watching the actress, who was playing a naive girl, attentively listening to the leading man's declaration of love, while at the same time staring intently at the face of a noble young man who had just entered the theater.\n[1898-10-06 21:49:49] Theater | When I saw the leading man, burning with passionate words, casting fiery glances toward an opulently dressed old lady sitting in a nearby box, Steven found it amusing, as if he were watching a character from an old comic novel.\n[1898-10-06 21:49:54] Theater | I thought that, especially through Peter's introduction to Steven about the private lives of the actors, beneath this spoken drama, Steven saw another silent, expressive play within a play.\n[1898-10-06 21:49:59] Theater | I thought of the radio play, though unremarkable, which Steven still watched with great interest; because of the lighting effects, because the actors had painted their faces with the makeup of their roles and worn their masks, because their hearts were filled with the lines of their characters, Steven felt that the brief but vivid personalities of the characters were fully presented within an hour, lifelike and deeply moving.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:04] Theater | I thought about how people love these vivid characters, how they admire and feel compassion for them, and how they want to see them again after leaving the theater, yet they have already disintegrated into a comedian no longer part of the play, a script that no longer reveals the actor's face, a particle of makeup wiped away by a handkerchief.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:09] Theater | I thought that, in the end, once the performance was over, the vivid personalities of the characters would vanish completely. Stevens would feel as though they had lost someone they loved, questioning their own existence and pondering the idea of death.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:14] Theater | I saw a program that made Steven feel extremely uneasy. A young actress, just making her stage debut, was going to sing a few old songs. She had placed all her future and her family's hopes on this performance.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:19] Theater | I found the actress's hips to be excessively large, so large they made me laugh when I saw them; her voice was sweet, but too small, and it became even smaller when she got excited. This small voice and large hips formed a striking contrast. I knew that Brian and several of her girlfriends hated her.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:34] Theater | I saw Brian lying in wait for her boyfriend and girlfriend in the theater. I knew their task was to unsettle this stage novice with sarcastic remarks (because they knew she must be nervous), so that she would become flustered and lost, and finally completely break down, ensuring that the theater manager wouldn't sign a contract with her.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:44] Theater | I saw this unfortunate actress had just begun singing when several men, specially recruited for this kind of mischief, turned their backs to the stage and burst into loud laughter. Several accomplice women laughed even louder. Each note from the flute added to the premeditated wave of laughter.\n[1898-10-06 21:50:54] Theater | I felt the unfortunate actress's pain deeply, her face, coated with makeup, glistening with sweat. I saw the theater instantly erupt into chaos.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:04] Theater | I saw her struggle for a while, then cast a painful and angry look at the surrounding audience. I saw that this made the boos even louder.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:14] Theater | I saw that the instinct to imitate and the desire to appear clever and brave had caused some beautiful actresses to join the crowd of hecklers.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:19] Theater | I saw that they were not accomplices, but they sent venomous and knowing glances toward those guys, laughing loudly and shamelessly, which caused the stage manager to order the curtain to be lowered after the second song—despite there still being five songs left to sing.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:29] Theater | I thought of Steven trying hard to keep himself from thinking about this unexpected event, just as he had once tried not to think of his grandmother's pain when his aunt had played a trick on his old grandmother by deliberately making his grandfather drink brandy. For Steven, even a prank was painful.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:34] Theater | I thought that, just as Stevens' compassion for unfortunate people often falls in the wrong place, because Stevens imagine them as being in unbearable pain, yet the person, forced to struggle against his suffering, doesn't really want to wallow in self-pity.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:39] Theater | I thought that, in their innermost souls, the pranksters were not necessarily as cruel as Steven and others imagined, nor did they simply want to build their happiness on someone else's suffering.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:44] Theater | I thought that hatred had stirred up his bad heart, and anger had given him passion and energy, but this passion and energy brought no pleasure at all; only those who took pleasure in inflicting pain could find enjoyment in it. The sadist always considered the person he was tormenting to be a villain as well.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:49] Theater | I thought Brian must have considered the actress she was tormenting as someone unremarkable, and that booing her was, in any case, a revenge for refined sensibilities, a warning to a mediocre colleague.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:54] Theater | I thought that, after all, Steven would be best advised not to speak about it, because Steven lacked both the courage and the ability to prevent things from happening; moreover, even if Steven were to plead on behalf of the victim, he would find it difficult to explain the tormentors' actions as stemming from a desire to satisfy their cruel hearts.\n[1898-10-06 21:51:59] Theater | I know that Brian played a minor role in a small play. But she was completely different on stage than off. I thought, but the opening of the performance attracted Steven's interest in another way. Finally, Steven began to understand why Peter had been mistaken about Brian, and why the impression they had—Steven and Peter—when they saw his mistress beneath the flowering pear tree that morning had been so completely different.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:04] Theater | I thought of Brian's face, which from a distance looked like a flower (not necessarily on a stage, because the world is a larger theater), but up close wasn't so impressive.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:09] Theater | I thought about how, when people stood beside her, they only saw a blurry nebula, a Milky Way dotted with freckles and small bumps.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:14] Theater | I thought that, if kept at a proper distance, the red freckles and small bumps would disappear from her cheeks, and a beautiful, clean nose would rise on her face like a new moon. At that moment, you would want—assuming you had never seen her up close—to be the object of her attention, to see her constantly, to keep her by your side.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:19] Theater | I knew Steven wasn't the type to behave like that, but Peter had already reacted this way the first time he saw her perform.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:39] Theater | I thought of how Peter, at that time, was wondering how to approach her, how to get to know her, and in his mind he had imagined a wonderful world, the world in which she lived, from which radiant beams of beauty seemed to emanate, yet he could not enter into it.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:44] Theater | After the play ended, I saw him preparing to leave the theater, lost in thought. I knew that he first met her several years ago in a theater in a provincial town.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:54] Theater | I thought to myself that writing her a letter was probably the act of a fool, and she would not answer him, even though he was ready to dedicate his fortune and his name to her, to this woman who lived in a world far superior to the one he knew, a world beautified by wishes and dreams.\n[1898-10-06 21:52:59] Theater | I saw him, just as he was about to leave, at the actors' entrance. He saw the performers who had just performed, each wearing an elegant hat, laughing and talking as they came out through a door. A few young men who knew them were waiting at the entrance.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:09] Theater | I thought it was truly a coincidence! In a hall where there was no one I knew, an unexpected person arrived. The Stevenes never imagined they would meet him here, and he came at the perfect moment. The Stevenes would think it was a meeting arranged by God for them. They didn't know that if they hadn't been here, but somewhere else, another coincidence would have occurred, giving rise to other desires, and another acquaintance would have come to help them fulfill those desires.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:14] Theater | I thought that the golden gates of the dream world had already closed behind her before Peter saw Brian exit the theater, so her red freckles and small pimples were irrelevant.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:19] Theater | I thought, but those things would not have pleased him either, because he was no longer alone, no longer possessed the imagination he had when watching a play at the theater. Yet even though what he saw was no longer the Brian of the stage, she still governed his actions, just like those celestial bodies, which continue to rule over Steven even when they are not visible.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:24] Theater | I saw that Peter's desire to possess the pretty actress—despite his inability to remember her face—prompted him to rush toward the old classmate he had unexpectedly encountered here, begging him to introduce him to (since it was the same person) this plain-looking woman with a face covered in red freckles, thinking he would study later whether this woman was on stage or off.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:29] Theater | I saw her, but she was eager to leave, not even saying a word to Peter. A few days later, he finally managed to persuade her to leave her companions and take her back to her residence.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:39] Theater | I thought he had already fallen in love with her. He needed dreams. He longed for happiness through the lover in his dream. This made him quickly place all his possible happiness on the woman he had just accidentally discovered on the stage a few days before. At that time, he didn't even know her, and she was still an indifferent person to him.",

    "text": "[1898-10-06 21:53:44] Behind the theater | I saw that during the intermission, the Stevenes went backstage. This was a place Steven had never been before, and he felt a bit nervous, unsure of how to act.\n[1898-10-06 21:53:49] Backstage at the theater | I saw that, therefore, Steven was very eager to speak with Peter, so that Steven could pretend to be deeply engaged in the conversation, and others would think that Steven was fully attentive to the discussion, not paying attention to anything else around him, and thus believe that Steven's facial expression naturally did not match the place—frankly, Steven was almost unaware of where he was.\n[1898-10-07 04:30:47] Backstage at the theater | I saw that in order to escape the situation, Steven seized upon the first topic that flashed through Steven's mind. \"I heard him say, 'You know,' Steven said to Peter, 'Steven came to say goodbye to you on the day he left. We never had a chance to talk about it. Steven even greeted you on the street.'\"\n[1898-10-07 04:30:52] Behind the theater | \"I don't want to talk about it,\" he answered. \"Steven feels terribly sorry for you. Steven and his friends were meeting near the camp, but Steven couldn't stop because he was late. Steven assures you that he's very upset about it.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:30:57] Backstage at the theater | I thought to myself, he recognized Steven! The scene of that day was still vivid in Steven's memory: he raised his hand to his hat brim, giving Steven a military salute without any emotion, neither looking at him to show he had recognized Steven, nor gesturing to indicate his regret at not being able to stop.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:02] Backstage at the theater | I thought, of course, that he pretended not to recognize Steven, which made things simpler. But he was so decisive that before his first impression had even had a chance to show through, he had already made up his mind, which could not help but surprise Steven.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:07] Behind the theater | I recalled that in Riverside, Steven had noticed that on one hand, he had a sincere and simple face, with pale skin that made his sudden bursts of passion immediately apparent, but on the other hand, he also had a well-trained, adaptable body. He was like an excellent comic actor, able to play various different roles successively in both military life and social settings.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:12] Backstage at the theater | I thought of how in one of his roles, he had loved Steven so deeply, as a brother to Steven; he had once been Steven's older brother, and still was, but for a brief moment he had suddenly become someone else.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:17] Backstage at the theater | I thought about how he didn't know Steven, how he held the reins, wore his monocle, didn't even look at Steven or offer him a smile, but raised his hand to his hat brim and gave Steven a proper military salute!\n[1898-10-07 04:31:22] Backstage at the theater | I saw the scenery had not yet been taken down, and Steven walked through the middle of it. I knew that the set designer had taken into account the effects of distance and lighting when constructing the scenery, so when those elements were removed, the sets became worthless.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:32] Backstage at the theater | I thought about when Steven approached Brian and realized her loss was no less than that of the scenery. Her lovely nostrils, like the three-dimensional quality of the set, had remained in the visual scene between the theater and the stage.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:37] Behind the theater | I thought of her as having become a completely different person; Steven could only recognize her by her eyes, for her personality was hidden within them. This new star, which had just been so bright, was now dimmed.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:42] Behind the Theater | I thought the opposite: just as Steven, when looking at the moon up close, would find it no longer glowing with rose and golden hues, so too did Steven now see nothing but freckles and an uneven surface on a face that had just moments before been smooth and clean.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:47] Backstage at the theater | I saw a group of journalists and socialites smoking and chatting as they would at a social gathering, constantly greeting people. They were friends of the actress.\n[1898-10-07 04:31:57] Behind the theater | I saw Steven happily notice that among them there was a young man wearing a black velvet cap, dressed in a hydrangea-patterned dress, his face painted red, like a portrait drawn in red chalk in a Watteau album; he smiled with a gentle expression, his eyes sparkling with blue light, making all kinds of graceful movements, lightly hopping around, seemingly belonging to an entirely different category from the sensible people around him, who were dressed in short jackets and tailcoats.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:02] Behind the theater | I thought of him as a madman, passionately chasing his own dreams, dreams that had nothing to do with the worries of those around him, existing long before their civilization had even taken shape, unbound by any natural laws. He was like a painted butterfly, lost and fluttering freely among the sky's scenery, drawing simple, natural Arabesque patterns in the air.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:07] Backstage at the theater | I thought that seeing this scene would make people feel at ease and cheerful.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:12] Backstage at the theater | I saw it just then, and Peter imagined his mistress had taken an interest in the male dancer who was doing his final rehearsal before taking the stage; his face instantly turned dark.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:17] Behind the theater | I saw him look at her darkly. I heard, \"You can look somewhere else, you know.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:32:22] Backstage at the theater | I heard, \"You know these dancers aren't worth a single wire. They'd better go tightrope walking and break their backs. Soon they'll be bragging all over the place that you noticed them. Besides, you clearly heard them call you to the dressing room to change. You'll be late again.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:32:27] Behind the theater | At that moment, I saw three men—three reporters—amused by Peter's angry expression, coming over to hear what he was saying. Meanwhile, on the other side, the Stevenes were pushed against them as the set was being arranged.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:37] Backstage at the theater | I saw Peter's mistress staring at the dancer and burst out. \"I heard, 'Ah! But Steven recognized him, he's Steven's friend. Look at his fine figure, see how nimble his little hands are, moving so gracefully, every part of his body moves with it!\"\n[1898-10-07 04:32:42] Behind the theater | I saw the dancer turn her face toward her. I saw him, though he was disguised as a spirit of the air, still clearly retaining the shape of a human. His eyes were like a gray frosty ribbon, trembling and sparkling between his dyed, stiff lashes. A single smile stretched his lips apart, extending to his cheeks that were painted with rouge.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:52] Backstage at the theater | I saw him, in order to please this young woman, enthusiastically and skillfully reenact the hand movements he had just made, like a child. I thought of a singer, who, when the Stevenes praised him for singing a certain song well, would kindly sing it again softly for the Stevenes.\n[1898-10-07 04:32:57] Backstage at the theater | I saw Brian clapping and cheering. \"I heard, 'Ah! Wonderful, just like before!\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:02] Backstage at the theater | I saw Peter looking sad as he spoke to her. I heard, \"Please, Steven's dear, don't make such a scene. Steven can't stand it. Steven swears to you. If you say another word, Steven won't go with you to the dressing room anymore. Steven is leaving. All right, stop being naughty. Hey, don't stay in that thick smoke, it's not good for you.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:07] Backstage at the theater | I saw him turn his face toward Steven again, and his expression showed concern for Steven. I thought that ever since Steven and his friends met in Riverside, he had always shown such concern for Steven.",

You're going, Steven would be delighted!\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:17] Backstage at the theater | I heard, \"I'm telling you, Steven won't be coming back.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:22] Backstage at the theater | I heard, \"I dare not entertain such a wish.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:27] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard, 'Listen, you know, Steven promised to buy you a necklace if you were nicer, but now that you're treating Steven like this...\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:32] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven wouldn't be surprised by this. You made a wish for Steven, and Steven should have known you wouldn't keep your promise. You want to show off your money, but Steven isn't as selfish as you. Steven doesn't want your necklace. Someone else will give Steven one.'\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:37] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard, 'No one can give it to you, because Steven had Boulanger keep it for Steven, and he promised not to sell it to anyone other than Steven.'\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:42] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard, 'Exactly, you want to swindle Steven, you had everything planned in advance. No wonder they say that Mansart means Mater Semita, this name reeks of Jews!\" I knew Brian had made a mistake in her etymology, saying \"sheep's path\" instead of \"Semitic.\" The retrialists applied this etymology to Peter because he had advocated for the retrial of the Unknown_Dreyfus case.\n[1898-10-07 04:33:47] Backstage at the theater | I thought, but Peter's being a reactionary was entirely due to this actress (who was the least qualified of all to call Madame de Mauves a Jew, besides, those social ethnologists had only discovered that Peter's Robert was related to the Jewish Levy-Mirbeau family, and nothing else).\n[1898-10-07 04:33:52] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard, 'But Steven will find a way to get that necklace, just believe me. Bussolin's promises are worthless in such situations. You've betrayed Steven, and Bussolin will find out. Someone will pay double for his necklace. Don't worry, you'll hear from Steven soon.'\"\n[1898-10-07 04:33:57] Backstage at the theater | I thought of a hundred reasons for Peter. But things are always so complicated and messy, and someone with a hundred reasons might still be without one once. Steven couldn't help but recall the unpleasant yet innocent words Peter had said at Riverside: \"In this way, Steven will be able to control her.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:02] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard you say, 'You misunderstood Marcel's meaning about the necklace. Marcel isn't making a random wish. Since you've been trying every way to get Marcel to leave you, it's only natural that Marcel wouldn't give you the necklace. Marcel doesn't understand how he's betrayed you. Where is Marcel being selfish? How can you say Marcel is showing off his wealth? Marcel has always told you he's broke, penniless. You're wrong, my dear Marcel. You know full well that Marcel's only concern has always been you.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:07] Backstage at the theater | I saw her mock him, making a gesture of contempt, then turned her face toward the dancer. \"I heard, 'Yes, yes, go ahead. Oh! His hands were incredible. Steven is a woman, but Steven couldn't make such graceful movements.'\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:12] Backstage at the theater | I saw her turn her face toward him, pointing with her finger at Peter's convulsing face. I heard, \"You see, he can't take it anymore.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:17] Backstage at the theater | I saw her whispering to the dancer. I thought of how a momentary impulse had made her as cruel as a tyrant, yet this was not the true feeling she had for Peter.\n[1898-10-07 04:34:22] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard, 'Listen, one last time, Steven swears to you that in a week you'll regret it so much you'll beg Steven to come back, but Steven won't come. The glass is already full. Be careful, there's no way to undo it. You'll regret it one day, and then it'll be too late.'\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:27] Backstage at the theater | I thought perhaps this was his true feeling. Leaving his mistress was certainly painful for him, but in his eyes, it was better to break up sooner rather than suffer like this by her side.\n[1898-10-07 04:34:32] Behind the Theater | I heard, \"Dear, don't stay there, Steven is telling you, you'll cough.\" I know he said it again to Steven.\n[1898-10-07 04:34:37] Backstage at the theater | I saw Steven point to the set beside him, meaning that Steven couldn't move. He gently touched his hat on his head and said to the reporter beside him: I heard, \"Sir, would you please throw away your cigarette, Steven's friend can't stand the smell of smoke.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:42] Backstage at the theater | I saw his mistress leave without waiting for him, heading toward her dressing room. She took a few steps, then turned back.\n[1898-10-07 04:34:52] Behind the theater | I saw her pretending to be innocent, shouting in an affected, pleasing voice toward the male dancer in the depths of the stage. I heard, \"When he's with a woman, are his little hands just as skillful? You really do look like a woman, Steven believes, and Steven would get along with you just as well as he would with one of Steven's girlfriends.\"\n[1898-10-07 04:34:57] Backstage at the theater | \"I heard 'As far as Steven knows, there's no rule against smoking here! If you're sick, you should stay at home!'\" I know what the journalist said.\n[1898-10-07 04:35:02] Backstage at the theater | I saw the male dancer smile mysteriously at the female comedian.\n[1898-10-07 04:35:12] Behind the Theater | I saw her shouting at him. \"I heard, 'Ah! Don't speak, you're driving Steven crazy, Steven will go on dates again later!\"\n[1898-10-07 04:35:17] Behind the theater | I heard, \"Anyway, sir, you're not very polite.\" I thought of Peter's remarks to the journalist, how he remained calm and polite, as if merely confirming a fact, like delivering a post-event verdict on an accident.\n[1898-10-07 13:58:39] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw, after a while, a tall old woman entering gracefully. I saw her with a solemn expression, her white hair, styled in the high pile of Marie Antoinette, peeking out from under her curled hat.\n[1898-10-07 13:58:49] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I knew these three women came from the same noble background as the Baroness de Charles, but for various reasons (reasons that had long since faded into darkness), only a few forgotten and insignificant people now visited their salons. I thought that at that time, Steven did not know that she was one of the three exceptional ladies still seen in Willowbrook society.\n[1898-10-07 13:58:54] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I knew that each of these three ladies had her own \"Galmont Edward,\" which was her niece. This dazzling niece came to pay her respects, but she never managed to draw the other two ladies' \"Galmont Edwards\" into her aunt's salon.\n[1898-10-07 13:59:14] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I knew that Charles was on close terms with these three ladies, but I did not like them. I thought that perhaps because their situation was similar to hers, it might make her feel sad upon seeing them.\n[1898-10-07 13:59:19] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I knew that, in addition, they were just as sharp-tongued and learned, and that they hoped to form so-called salons by frequently performing one-act comedies.\n[1898-10-07 13:59:39] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I knew the competition between them was fierce, and this rivalry had turned into a struggle for survival, since they had squandered their entire fortunes over the years and were now almost penniless, forced to eke out a living by relying on or exploiting the unpaid assistance of some actor.",

    "text": "[1898-10-07 13:59:59] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I knew that, whenever this lady with the Marie Antoinette hairstyle saw Charles, she inevitably thought of Edward de Fairhaven, who had never attended her Friday gatherings.\n[1898-10-07 14:00:04] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I know, but every Friday, her faithful relative Princess de Fairhaven came to visit, which gave her some comfort. This was her \"Edward de Fairhaven.\" Although the Princess de Fairhaven was a good friend of Edward de Fairhaven, she never visited the Charles family.\n[1898-10-07 14:00:24] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought that, yet Steven felt a relationship of mutual dependence and mutual hatred bound the three exiled goddesses closely together, from the mansion on the Quai de Malakoff to the salons of Rue Duroc, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and Rue des Écoles.\n[1898-10-07 14:00:29] The drawing room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I wished I could look up the social mythology dictionary to find out exactly what scandalous affair they had gotten into, which divine law they had violated to deserve such a tragic punishment. Perhaps it was largely because they came from noble families and were now all in difficult circumstances that they had to hate each other while remaining closely entangled.\n[1898-10-07 14:00:34] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought to myself, they had all found excellent ways to flatter their guests. Imagine, when they introduced their guests to a lady of high rank, who had a sister married to a certain Count Sagan Samuel or a Prince Ligny, how could their guests fail to feel they had stepped into the most exclusive salon of aristocratic women?\n[1898-10-07 14:00:39] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I know, and besides, the newspapers talk all day about these so-called salons, but they rarely report on real ones. Even those nephews and nieces, the so-called \"finest\" of the upper class (especially Peter), when they hear a fellow student ask them to introduce his friends to the upper class, will say: \"Let Steven take you to Steven's Aunt Verdurin's house, or to some other aunt's... it's a very interesting salon.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:00:59] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I knew they clearly understood that introducing a friend to the salon of the Charles family might be easier than taking them to the homes of these ladies' beautiful and refined nieces or sisters-in-law.\n[1898-10-07 14:01:19] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I know that some old men and young women told Steven that these elderly women were not accepted by the upper class because of their past behavior, which was too scandalous. When Steven argued that such behavior shouldn't prevent them from being refined, they reminded him that their scandalous conduct exceeded people's imagination today.\n[1898-10-07 14:01:39] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought of these solemn, properly seated ladies, whose improper behaviors, once whispered about, took on an unfathomable sense of prehistoric mystery, like that of the mammoth. In short, these three fates with white, blue, or red hair had spun the threads of life for countless men.\n[1898-10-07 14:01:44] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought of Steven, who, like modern people, exaggerated the misfortunes of mythological times, just as the Greeks created Icarus, Theseus, and Hercules. Yet these figures had nothing in common with the people who, long afterward, worshipped them as gods.\n[1898-10-07 14:01:49] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I thought that people always wait until a person is no longer likely to do wrong before they come to reckon with his past misdeeds, seeing only that he is now suffering social punishment, and then measuring, imagining, even exaggerating the extent of his crimes according to the severity of the punishment.\n[1898-10-07 14:01:54] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I knew that she received as many people as she could, not just whoever she wanted, and immoral women dared not enter her salon; the Pope of Northgate often bestowed upon her a \"golden rose.\" She occasionally wrote a book about Lamartine's youth, which had been praised by the French Academy. I thought of the long corridor of symbolist paintings in the \"upper society\" exhibition, where truly frivolous women, utter sluts, always appeared as an elderly lady, dignified and haughty.\n[1898-10-07 14:01:59] The drawing room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Charles speak to the lady with the Marie Antoinette hairstyle, who cast a sharp glance around the drawing room, trying to find a target useful for her salon. I heard \"Hello, Alex.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:02:04] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I thought she would have to find out for herself, because there was no doubt that the cunning Charles would never introduce her to someone valuable.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:09] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Charles being careful, deliberately not introducing her to Richard. I thought to myself, it's really like that! She was afraid that Richard would take the one-act comedy he had performed at her place and put it on at the Quai de la Malaquerie.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:14] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I knew it was just a case of tit for tat. The previous day, the lady on the Malakoff River had invited Madame Léonie to recite poetry, and she kept it a secret from Charles, because this Italian actress had been taken away from her.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:34] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought of the lady on the Malakoff embankment, who didn't want Charles to find out about it from the newspaper, and also feared her resentment, so she came to tell her, as if she had done nothing wrong.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:39] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Charles tell her Steven's name. I thought she probably believed that Steven was unlike Richard, and introducing Steven to the Mary Antoinette on the riverbank would cause no trouble.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:44] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Madame de Bournand trying not to move her body. I knew she wanted to keep her aging appearance in the lines of the Venus of Gavroche (in a distant past, dashing young men had been entranced by her, and even now, many pretenders to literature still praised her in rhymed verses)—besides, she had developed the habit of always posing with an air of haughty dignity.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:54] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw her coldly and solemnly give a slight nod, then turn her face away and never look at Steven again, as though Steven didn't exist. I thought that anyone who is specially humiliated and yet forced to approach others will adopt this compensatory expression.\n[1898-10-07 14:02:59] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought she was killing two birds with one stone, as if saying to Charles, \"You see, Steven doesn't care about one or two more connections. Steven isn't interested in young boys. They're always spreading rumors about people.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:03:04] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I saw it, but when she was leaving an hour later, she secretly invited Steven to her compartment for the following Friday, slipping away in the commotion. I thought this was one of the famous private compartments, and its name—besides, she was a de Charlus—produced a strange impression on Steven.\n[1898-10-07 14:03:09] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I saw Charles speaking to the Jansenist historian, as if complaining in a low voice. I heard, \"Sir, Steven probably thinks you're writing about Edward de Montmorency.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:03:14] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I thought to myself that she could not possibly know that her gentle and amiable expression had been wrinkled, torn, and marred by this sullen muttering, by the physiological irritability caused by aging, and by the unnaturalness of imitating the coarse, peasant-like tone of old nobility.",

This one is the original, the one at the Valleyview is a copy.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:03:24] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw her set down the brush beside the flowers, stand up, and reveal the little apron around her waist. I knew she was wearing the apron to keep her clothes from getting paint on them.\n[1898-10-07 14:03:34] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw that her wide-brimmed soft hat and heavy glasses already made her look like a country woman, and with that little apron tied around her, she looked even more rustic.\n[1898-10-07 14:03:49] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw that her servants, the steward who served tea and pastries to the guests, and the servant who had been ordered to illuminate the portrait of Montmorency Edward (she was a nun-abbess of a renowned Eastern convent), were all dressed in splendid uniforms, in sharp contrast to Charles's shabby attire.\n[1898-10-07 14:04:04] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw everyone standing up. \"I find it interesting,\" she said, \"that the great-aunts and aunties of the Stevenes were often the nuns who ran these councils, yet the daughters of French kings were not admitted. These councils were very difficult to get into.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:04:09] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Richard was astonished and asked. \"I heard 'not absorbed? The king's daughter? Why?'\"\n[1898-10-07 14:04:14] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I saw Richard even more surprised. \"I heard, 'Because since the French royal family married non-royals, their territory shrank.'\" \"Married non-royals? The French royal family? What's going on?\"\n[1898-10-07 14:04:19] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Charles answer in an extremely natural tone, saying again. I heard, \"It's the Medici family, of course. This portrait is very beautiful, isn't it? It's in excellent condition.\"\n[1898-10-07 14:04:24] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw the lady with the Marie Antoinette hairstyle say. \"I heard 'Steven, dear friend, do you remember? The day Steven brought Liszt to you, he said to you that this painting was a copy.'\"\n[1898-10-07 14:04:29] The drawing room of the Villeparisis Mansion | \"I heard 'If it's about music, Steven would certainly respect Liszt's opinion, but not when it comes to painting! Besides, he's already old and senile. Steven doesn't remember having said that. But then, it wasn't you who brought him here. Before that, Steven had dined with Princess Szechenyi at least twenty times.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:00:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Alexs, realizing this move had failed, shut his mouth and stood motionless. I saw her face, powdered with layer upon layer of perfume, as lifeless as a plaster mask. Her profile was dignified and luxurious, like a weathered goddess statue in a park, her short cloak concealing the moss-covered triangular pedestal.\n[1898-10-07 19:00:15] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I heard, \"Ah! Another beautiful portrait.\" I know that historians say.\n[1898-10-07 19:00:25] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I saw the door open, and Edward entered.\n[1898-10-07 19:00:30] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Charles say something, not even bothering to lift his head, he pulled out a hand from the pocket of his apron and handed it to Edward, who had just entered, then immediately turned his head back to the historian, ignoring her completely. I heard, \"You're here, hello. This is the portrait of La Rochejouan, Edward...\"\n[1898-10-07 19:00:40] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw a young servant enter carrying a tray, on which was a business card. I saw that he looked very courageous, and his face was quite handsome (though, in order to be perfectly flawless and impregnable, he had shaped his face just right, with a slightly reddish nose and skin that was faintly glowing, as if it still bore the traces of being freshly carved with a knife).\n[1898-10-07 19:00:45] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | \"I heard, 'That's the gentleman who's come to visit Charles several times.' 'Did you tell him that Steven has a guest?' 'He heard the sound of someone speaking.'\"\n[1898-10-07 19:00:50] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | \"I heard, 'Well, let him in. He was introduced to Steven by someone else, and he told Steven he really wanted to be received here. Steven never agreed. But he's come five times now. You can't just make people unhappy, can you?'\" I knew that Charles said.\n[1898-10-07 19:00:55] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I saw her say something to Steven, then point to the Jansenist historian. I heard, \"Sir, and you too, sir, Steven is introducing his niece, Edward de Fairhaven.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:01:00] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw the historian bow as deeply as Steven, his mouth just about to open, but Edward's expression instantly cooled him half to death. I thought that he believed that after making a bow, he would always receive some sign of friendliness, and his eyes would light up.\n[1898-10-07 19:01:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Edward, with her independent upper body, bowing forward with an exaggerated gesture, then lifting her head so that her gaze seemed not to notice the two people standing in front of her.\n[1898-10-07 19:01:15] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw her give a soft snort, then her nostrils flared. I thought this perfectly showed how her attention was utterly bored, and neither Steven nor the historian had left any impression on her.\n[1898-10-07 19:01:25] The drawing room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw an unwelcome guest come in, and he kept heading toward Charles. I saw him with a childlike and earnest expression. It was Thomas!\n[1898-10-07 19:01:30] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw him say it, emphasizing the words \"ming gan.\" \"I heard, 'Madame, you have granted Steven the honor of receiving him. Steven is deeply grateful. You have given an old man a most extraordinary and exquisite happiness. Steven assures you that the effect of this...'\"\n[1898-10-07 19:01:40] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw him catch sight of Steven and abruptly stopped speaking.\n[1898-10-07 19:01:45] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I heard, \"Steven is showing the gentleman the beautiful portrait of Edward de La Rocheferme, the wife of the author of the Maxims, which is a family heirloom.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:01:50] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Edward greeting Alix, and she expressed her regret at not having been able to visit her this year, like everyone else. She also said. I heard, \"Steven often hears from you through the madeleine.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:01:55] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I heard, \"She had lunch with Steven today.\" I know what Albertine said. I thought about how Charles would never be able to say that, and I felt a swell of pride.\n[1898-10-07 19:02:00] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw that while they were chatting, Steven was talking to Richard. Afraid that Richard might be envious of Steven's life, he told him that he must be living a happier life than Steven. I knew that because Steven had heard that his father's attitude toward him had worsened. I thought it was merely a polite phrase, but people with strong self-esteem often easily believe that they have truly been fortunate, or they are very eager to convince others that they have had good luck.",

    "text": "[1898-10-07 19:02:05] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I saw Richard cheerfully saying something to Steven. I heard, \"Yes, Steven is living very happily. Steven has three inseparable friends; another Steven wouldn't be needed. Steven has a mistress to envy, and Steven is extremely happy. The father of the gods, Zeus, rarely grants such happiness to anyone.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:02:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I thought that Steven believed he was mainly trying to show off, to make people envious, but perhaps beneath his optimism there was also a desire to cultivate a unique style. It was obvious that he didn't want to give the usual, commonplace answer of \"Ah, it's nothing,\" and so on.\n[1898-10-07 19:02:30] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I know that once, one afternoon, there was a ball at his house, and Steven had been unable to attend for some reason. When Steven asked him, \"Was it fun?\" he replied in a calm and indifferent manner, as if talking about someone else's affair: \"Yes, it was very fun, there was no more successful ball. It was so enjoyable that one forgot to go home.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:02:35] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | \"I heard that you told Steven stories that interested him very much,\" Mr. Thomas said to Charles, \"that day Steven thought your style was very similar to his own, concise and direct. If I were to use two contradictory words to descri be it, it would be 'motion with stillness, eternity in an instant.'\"\n[1898-10-07 19:02:40] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I heard, \"Tonight, Steven really wanted to write down everything you said, but Steven will certainly remember it all in his mind. What you said, as Joubert would say (Steven thinks that's what he meant), is a valuable teacher and friend worth remembering.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:02:45] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | \"I heard, 'You've never read Jules's books? Oh! If you read them, he'd be so happy in his grave! Please allow Steven to send you his books from tonight on. Steven is proud to introduce you to his thoughts. He may not have your talent, but his writing is just as beautiful as yours.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:02:50] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Steven about to go over and greet Thomas, but he always tried to stay as far away from Steven as possible. I realized clearly that he didn't want Steven to hear his endless, charming flattery about Charles.\n[1898-10-07 19:02:55] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw her smiling and shrugging her shoulders as if she had heard a mocking remark, then she turned her head toward the historian. I heard, \"This woman is the famous Marie de Rohan, that is, Edward de Sefler, whose first husband was Monsieur de Luyne.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:00] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | \"I heard 'Dear, speaking of Madame de Fairhaven, it made Steven think of Yvonne. She came to Steven's yesterday. If Steven had known you didn't have guests last night, he would have sent for you. Madame Rastignac arrived suddenly and recited the lines of Queen Cyméa in front of the author. It was beautiful!\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:05] The drawing room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I heard, but she replied, \"Steven wasn't busy yesterday, but even if you asked Steven, Steven wouldn't go. Steven saw her perform when Madame Lestrade was lucky, but her golden age has passed. Besides, Steven doesn't like the lines of Queen Célimène.\" I thought, \"How despicable!\" Charles said to himself, \"That day, she was whispering with Madame de Broussard and Madame de Charlus, surely about this.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I heard that \"Madame Lestrade had come here once, brought by Edward d'Astier. She recited a passage from Dante's Inferno. She did it beautifully, absolutely incomparable.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:20] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Alice withstand the blow with strength, remaining cold and indifferent as ever. I saw her with sharp, expressionless eyes, and her aquiline nose gave her an air of dignity and nobility.\n[1898-10-07 19:03:25] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw that one side of her face looked mottled, as if covered with scales. A sparse collection of strange growths, some green and others red, grew on her chin. I thought that perhaps by the next winter, she would be lying on the ground, unable to get up again.\n[1898-10-07 19:03:30] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Charles stop Thomas mid-sentence with this remark. \"I heard, 'Oh, sir, if you like painting, you might take a look at the portrait of Madame de Montmorency.'\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:35] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Thomas going to look at the paintings, and Edward seized the opportunity to ask her aunt with a mocking and inquisitive look who the man was. Charles whispered: I heard, \"It's Mr. Thomas, he has a sister, Madame de Cambremer, whose name you probably, like Steven, have never heard of.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:40] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Edward put her hand to her mouth and gasped. \"I heard, 'How come I've never heard of her? Steven is familiar with her, or rather, Steven doesn't know her. However, Samuel somehow met her husband and, by some strange coincidence, called this fat woman to see Steven.'\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:45] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | \"I heard her say, 'What kind of visit is that! As soon as she saw Steven, she told him she had gone to London and then proceeded to list every painting in the British Museum as if she were an expert.' You see, Steven, after leaving your place, still has to go to this monster's house to leave a calling card. Don't think it's an easy task. She pretends to be dying, spends all day at home, and no matter whether you come at seven in the evening or nine in the morning, she'll just make you eat strawberry tarts. Yes, that's right, she's a monster.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:50] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Edward notice her aunt's inquiring look, and she said again, \"Charles is asking his niece.\" I heard, \"This woman is really unbearable: she keeps using strange words like 'pen-pole'.\" \"What does 'pen-pole' mean?\"\n[1898-10-07 19:03:55] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Edward pretend to be angry. \"I don't know! Steven doesn't want to know. Steven doesn't speak that kind of French.\"\n[1898-10-07 19:04:00] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I saw her realize that Auntie truly didn't understand what a \"pen-writer\" meant, and she forced out a smile, but it was immediately chased away by the lingering look of pretended anger on her face. I heard \"Steven\" — everyone knew what it meant, the pen is mightier than the sword, a writer, a man of letters. But the word was too terrible, it would scare the teeth right out of your mouth. From now on, no one would ever ask Steven to speak again... I thought of her, who wanted to show that she was not only learned but also concerned with linguistic purity, and who, after mocking Madame de Cambremer, would also take a jab at her aunt.\n[1898-10-07 19:04:05] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I heard \"Well, this is her brother!\" Steven still hadn't figured it out. But in the end, it wasn't hard to understand. She was just as despicable as the little carpet by the bed, just as learned as the rotating bookcase. She knew how to flatter and fawn, and she was just as repulsive. Steven was beginning to have a more profound understanding of this notion of blood relations.\n[1898-10-07 19:04:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I heard Charles say to Edward, \"Sit down, have a cup of tea. You can take it yourself. It's a portrait of your great-grandparents. You don't need to look at it—you know it as well as Steven does.\"",

    "text": "[1898-10-07 20:00:30] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw him saying that, and Charles sat back down at his desk and began to draw again. Everyone gathered around, and Steven took the opportunity to approach Thomas. I thought that Steven didn't feel anything wrong with coming to the Charles house, never once considering that he might be hurting him, nor that Steven would think he was deliberately trying to hurt him.\n[1898-10-07 20:00:35] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw a sentence burst out of my mouth. I heard, \"Hello, sir, can Steven be excused for coming to the salon since you're here as well?\"\n[1898-10-07 20:00:40] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I thought that after hearing it, Thomas immediately judged Steven to be a terrible little scoundrel who loved doing bad things (at least, that was his verdict on Steven a few days later).\n[1898-10-07 20:00:45] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw him answer Steven without extending his hand. I heard, \"Can't you show some manners and ask Steven first?\" I saw the voice was angry and vulgar, so Steven couldn't even recognize it as his own.\n[1898-10-07 20:00:50] The drawing room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I thought this had little to do with the usual principles he talked about, but rather with his feelings in a more direct and intense way. Because when Steven and others decided to hide their feelings, they never imagined what form those feelings would take in the future.\n[1898-10-07 20:00:55] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I thought that suddenly, deep within the Stevens, a cruel and strange beast was roaring, its tone so terrible that when you heard it, unconsciously, simply, almost uncontrollably revealing your faults or weaknesses, you would feel a chill run down your spine.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:00] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought of how, just like a criminal who, unable to help himself, confesses to having killed someone, and you don't even know he's a criminal, such an unexpected and indirect, strange confession would also make you feel a sudden chill of fear.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:05] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I thought, of course, that Steven knew that idealism, even subjective idealism, could not prevent a philosophical master from indulging in fine food or persistently striving to be elected into the French Academy.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought, but Thomas certainly didn't need to keep reminding people that they belonged to another planet. In fact, the facial twitches caused by his anger or his flattery were simply an attempt to secure a prominent position on that other world.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:15] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw him continue to speak in a low voice. \"I heard, 'Of course, if someone keeps bothering Steven to go somewhere, even though Steven has his own freedom, Steven can't be unreasonable, can he?'\"\n[1898-10-07 20:01:25] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw Edward sitting down to drink tea. Her name, now with a title, added a fiefdom of Samuel to her body. I saw the Samuel estate spreading out in all directions, so that around her round stool, in the center of the drawing room, it was shaded by the thick foliage of the Fairhaven woods, fresh and bright, golden and radiant.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:30] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I thought to myself that Steven was only surprised why Edward's face showed no resemblance to the Fairhaven woods, there was not the slightest botanical feature about her face.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:35] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought most about the pimples on her cheeks—their appearance bore the mark of the Fairhaven family—that could be considered a result of her frequent horseback rides, but they couldn't be taken as an accurate depiction of such outdoor activity.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:40] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I later thought that when Edward became insignificant in Steven's eyes, he finally began to understand many of her characteristics, especially—Steven was limited to talking about things he had already felt to be attractive but was not yet skilled at appreciating—her eyes.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:45] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I thought of the blue sky of a French afternoon, imprisoned in her eyes, as if painted on a canvas, bare and exposed, bathed in a glow even without the sun.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:50] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought of her voice, and when I heard her hoarse voice, I would imagine it was someone from the lower classes speaking, with a listless, drawn-out tone, like the provincial sunlight shining on the steps of the church in Sunrise or in the pastry shop on the square—bright, lazy, and greasy.\n[1898-10-07 20:01:55] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I thought, but it was the first day, and Steven couldn't discern anything at all. Steven's intense concentration immediately melted away whatever slight feeling he might have had, otherwise Steven might have discovered some of the mysteries behind the name Fairhaven.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:00] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I thought to myself that, in anyone's eyes, Galmont's Edward was indeed her. The incredible life represented by that name was all contained within her body.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:05] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I thought of just now, when her body brought her mysterious life into the drawing room, among all sorts of people. The drawing room surrounded her life from all sides, and her life's reaction upon the drawing room was so powerful that, where her life no longer extended forward, Steven seemed to see boiling, undulating lines defining its boundaries.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:10] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw the clear shadow of the puffed-up Beijing silk skirt on the carpet, and in Edward's bright, clear eyes. When I think of those eyes, they sometimes overflow with worry and memory, with scorn, pleasure, curiosity, and thoughts that are unfathomable, and at other times they reflect strange and bizarre images.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:15] The drawing room of the Villa Parisis | I thought that if Steven had met the Duchesse de Fairhaven, Edward, at a party in Charles, rather than on one of her tea days in Charles as he was now, his emotions would not have been so intense.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:20] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw that this brought the fresh air of the outdoors into the salon, and brought light into the Willowbrook of twilight; even those tall windows, which were open and occasionally echoed with the sound of carriages, could not have brought in more light. I thought that this tea gathering was nothing more than a brief respite for those women when they went out. Just now, they had been rushing around with their hats on, like a carousel, passing from one salon to another, and upon entering the house, they didn't even take off their hats.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:25] The drawing room of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw Edward de Fairhaven wearing a flat-topped straw hat adorned with cornflowers. I thought of the straw hat not as evoking the sunlight of distant childhood—sunlight that had shone on the fields of Sunrise where Steven picked cornflowers and on the slopes beyond the fence at Véronique—but rather the scent and dust of dusk, the very scent and dust that had been stirred up when Edward crossed the Rue de la Paix just a moment ago.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:35] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw her smiling, her expression proud and distracted, her lips pursed and puckered as she traced circles on the carpet with the tip of her parasol, as if drawing circles with the tentacles of her mysterious life.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:40] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I saw that she then coldly surveyed everyone in turn, and this gaze immediately caused the people she noticed to become detached from her.",

I thought that because these furnishings were different from those of the Stevens, they somewhat belonged to her world, closely linked to her aunt's life.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:50] The drawing room of the Villeparisis estate | I saw her gaze shift again from the furniture in Bouville to the people, and she once more assumed her discerning and dissatisfied expression.\n[1898-10-07 20:02:55] The Drawing Room of the Villeparisis Mansion | I thought that my aunt's respect for me prevented her from expressing such feelings, but if what she saw on the armchair was not the Stevenes, but rather a stain or a layer of dust, she would have been just as dissatisfied.\n[1898-10-07 20:03:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven found the ending of the story less exciting than the beginning, because people didn't understand what it meant.\n[1898-10-08 09:50:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I know for certain that Sir Ruphus Israel was almost a king-like figure to Richard and his father, and Peter should have trembled before him.\n[1898-10-08 09:50:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that, but to the people in the Fairhaven' circle, he was nothing more than an upstart foreigner, tolerated by the upper class. I thought to myself that Steven knew they would never be proud of having his friendship, never!\n[1898-10-08 09:51:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that Steven learned it from the agent of Sir Ruphus Israel,\" Richard said, \"a man who was a friend of James's, an unusual person. Ah! A most incredible person.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:51:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him add, his tone certain and forceful, his voice full of enthusiasm. I thought that Steven spoke in this tone and manner only when he was certain that a person's growth did not depend on himself.\n[1898-10-08 09:51:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Hey, tell Steven,' Richard said to Steven in a low voice, 'how much property does Peter probably have?'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:51:15] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'You understand, even if Steven asked you this question, it doesn't mean Steven is interested in it. Steven is asking it from Unknown_Balzac's point of view. You understand. If he owned French and foreign stocks, real estate, do you know how to invest?'”\n[1898-10-08 09:51:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven unable to answer anything, and Richard stopped whispering and instead asked loudly if the window could be opened. Without waiting for an answer, he walked toward the window.\n[1898-10-08 09:51:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard Charles say that the window couldn't be opened, that she had a cold.\n[1898-10-08 09:51:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Ah! If that's the case, then never mind!' Richard replied, clearly disappointed. 'But it really is hot!'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:51:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him finish speaking and burst into laughter, his eyes scanning the audience, looking for an ally to help him deal with Charles. I thought of it, but everyone present was well-mannered and none supported him.\n[1898-10-08 09:51:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw his burning eyes failed to stir people up, and with no other choice, he had to resume a serious expression.\n[1898-10-08 09:51:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him, but he wasn't ready to give up, and he declared, \"At least twenty-two degrees. That is, twenty-five degrees, and Steven wouldn't be surprised. Steven was almost all sweat.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:52:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven doesn't have the talent of the philosopher Antenor. He is the son of the river god Alpheus. To stop his sweat, he first soaked in his James's embrace, then sat in a smooth bathtub, and finally anointed himself with fragrant sacred oil.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:52:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that he was, as it were, obliged to outline the medical theories to others, as though they were beneficial to everyone.\n[1898-10-08 09:52:10] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"If you think it's better this way, then so be it! Steven's opinion is completely different from yours. No wonder you've caught a cold.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:52:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Richard delighted at the idea of being introduced to Paul, and he said he would like to have him talk about the Unknown_Dreyfus case.\n[1898-10-08 09:52:20] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him speak in a mocking tone, as if to make it clear he didn't consider himself any less than the ambassador. I heard him say, \"There is a certain psychological state of Steven's that he doesn't fully understand. It would be quite interesting to have a conversation with the same important diplomat.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:52:25] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Charles, where he had said that line in a loud voice, and I felt somewhat annoyed, because her archivist was an anti-revisionist, and she dared not disagree with him. But when she saw that he was far away from them, couldn't hear what Richard was saying, and so she didn't mind.\n[1898-10-08 09:52:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him, at this moment, imitating his father's tone and making a joke, which further annoyed Charles. I know, but Richard, who had never received a proper education, had developed the bad habit of being self-important and looking down on everyone.\n[1898-10-08 09:52:40] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that Steven had read one of his insightful monographs, in which he convincingly argued that the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War would be a Russian victory and a Japanese defeat,\" he asked.\n[1898-10-08 09:52:45] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard Steven say, 'Is he getting a bit forgetful?' Steven seemed to see him grabbing a seat, and as soon as he spotted one, he rolled forward like ice-skating.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:52:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her ring the bell. \"Ridiculous! Wait a moment,\" Charles said again, \"Steven doesn't know what he's getting himself into.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:52:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that after the servant came in, he ordered him publicly. I thought that she seemed not to want to hide, and even hoped that people would know that her old friends spent most of their time at her house.\n[1898-10-08 09:53:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Go and get Paul here, he's in Steven's study sorting papers. We said he'd be back in twenty minutes, but Steven has been waiting for him for an hour and three quarters.'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:53:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her sulkily say to Richard. I heard, \"He'll tell you about the Unknown_Dreyfus case. Whatever you want to know, he'll tell you. He doesn't much approve of some of the department's methods.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:53:10] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that Paul had a bad relationship with the current ministry.\n[1898-10-08 09:53:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that although Paul dared not rashly bring government officials into the salon at Charles (she always considered herself a great lady and was too proud to associate with those people he had to maintain relations with), she often told her about matters from the ministry.\n[1898-10-08 09:53:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that, just like the others, these political figures dared not ask Paul to introduce them to Charles.\n[1898-10-08 09:54:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I know, but many people went to his country house, because they had problems and needed his help. They knew the address and went to the castle to find him.\n[1898-10-08 09:54:30] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Sir, Steven knows someone has come to disturb you. Has there been any progress?'\" I knew the mistress would not appear, but during dinner, she said to him.",

I heard, \"No, no. Steven wants to leave because Steven isn't feeling well. He has a problem with his gallbladder and will probably have to go to Vichy for a while.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:54:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Oh! Just as Steven's great-nephew Chateaureynard is also going there, you could make arrangements together. Is he still here? He's very nice, you know.\" I thought that Charles might have said it sincerely, believing that since she knew both of them, there was no reason they shouldn't keep in touch.\n[1898-10-08 09:54:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Richard delighted, but also a bit uneasy. \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven doesn't know if he's willing, Steven doesn't really... know him yet. He's over there.'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:54:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought the steward might not have fully carried out Charles's instructions.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Paul, in order to appear as though he had just arrived and hadn't yet seen the mistress of the house, had casually picked up a hat in the foyer (Steven seemed very familiar with it).\n[1898-10-08 09:55:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him go over to Charles, politely kiss her hand, and ask about her well-being with genuine concern, as if it had been a long time since they last met.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought he didn't know that this comedy had already been stripped of its disguise by Charles before it even began, and had suddenly come to a halt halfway through, because Charles had taken Paul and Richard into the adjacent drawing room.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about how Richard didn't know who the visitor was, and when he saw everyone greeting the ambassador warmly, and the ambassador responding with polite and elegant courtesy, bowing respectfully to each one, he felt neglected, convinced that the man would certainly not greet him, and he was very annoyed.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"Who's this fool?\" to Steven, in an effort to act as if nothing was wrong.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself that Paul's fawning politeness was utterly out of place with Richard's virtues, the straightforward qualities of a new social class, and that he, too, somewhat regarded such etiquette as ridiculous.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that no matter what, when Paul greeted him, he would no longer find such formalities ridiculous; on the contrary, he would be delighted.\n[1898-10-08 09:55:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Paul,' \" Charles said, \"Steven would like to introduce you to this guest. Mr. Richard, Paul.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:55:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that although she was not particularly polite toward Paul, she still addressed him as \"Paul.\" This was partly out of social etiquette and also showed that she placed great importance on the ambassador's position (a lesson Paul had repeatedly impressed upon her).\n[1898-10-08 09:55:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself that in a lady's salon, if someone was especially casual and informal with one person while being polite and formal with others, this would actually make it more obvious that the person was her lover.\n[1898-10-08 09:56:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul lower his blue gaze into his white collar, bowing deeply as if paying homage to the name Richard. I saw Steven, and the name seemed to be well-known and awe-inspiring.\n[1898-10-08 09:56:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him murmur, \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" I knew that, out of friendship for Charles, Paul was equally polite to everyone his old mistress introduced to him.\n[1898-10-08 09:56:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw, and so she said to Richard. I thought that, however, the courtesy seemed somewhat insufficient when applied to Richard.\n[1898-10-08 09:56:20] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'What do you want to know? Ask him quickly. If you don't feel comfortable speaking here, take him aside. He'd be very happy to talk to you.'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:56:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Steven thinks, you want to talk to him about the Unknown_Dreyfus case,' she added. I didn't care whether Paul wanted to talk about the subject or not, just as she hadn't asked the guests' permission when she had the historian light the portrait of Edward de Montmorency a moment ago, nor had she asked anyone's opinion when serving the tea.\n[1898-10-08 09:56:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I speak a bit louder,\" she said to Richard, \"he's a bit hard of hearing. But whatever you want him to say, he'll say it.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:56:35] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that he's very familiar with Unknown_Bismarck and Cavour, isn't that right, sir?\" she said loudly, \"Haven't you been very close to Unknown_Bismarck before?\"\n[1898-10-08 09:56:40] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul shaking hands warmly with Steven, while silently asking him something. I heard, \"You're writing something, aren't you?\"\n[1898-10-08 09:56:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven eagerly take the hat he thought, out of courtesy, should be held in his hand. I thought about how Steven had realized that the hat he had casually taken in the hall was Steven's.\n[1898-10-08 09:56:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"You showed a small work to Steven, and Steven found it too refined, too meticulous. Steven had frankly discussed his opinion with you.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:56:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"What you've done isn't worth putting on paper. Are you preparing something for Steven? You admire Christopher, if I'm not mistaken.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:00] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Hey! Don't speak ill of Christopher,' Edward shouted.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard \"Steven doesn't deny that Christopher has the talent for vivid characterization, no one denies that, Edward. Even if he doesn't have the genius of Chevalier, nor the ability to write a great work, he does excel at meticulous refinement.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:10] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"But Steven thinks that people of our time have messed up the classification of literary works. The novelist's task is to devise a plot and endow the characters in his novel with noble sentiments, rather than to painstakingly refine the illustrations on the frontispiece and decorative patterns at the end of each chapter with a dry pen.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him then turn his face toward Steven and say. I heard, \"Sunday, Steven will meet you at the honest A.J.'s house, James's.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that in the past, Steven had asked him to introduce Steven to John, but he refused. I thought of the moment when Steven, seeing him speaking with Edward, had briefly hoped that perhaps he could help Steven fulfill his long-cherished wish to pay a visit to Edward.\n[1898-10-08 09:57:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard that Goulmard's Edward has several of his excellent works in her collection, especially George's paintings, which are truly wonderful. Steven saw them at an exhibition and would love to see them again. This painting is really a remarkable masterpiece!'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself that indeed, if Steven were a famous person, and if someone asked Steven which painting he liked best, Steven would certainly name one by George.",

Paul exclaimed, his face showing surprise and reproach.\" I heard him say, \"It's not even a painting, just a sketch (he wasn't wrong about that). If you call such a sketch a masterpiece, then what do you call the Madonna by Gobineau or Danion de Bure?'\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward, after Richard had pulled the ambassador aside, say something to her aunt. I heard, \"I hear you don't approve of Peter's girlfriend performing. Steven thinks you have no reason to regret it; you know she's utterly mediocre, with no talent at all. Besides, her way of speaking and behaving is laughable.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I wonder how you came to know her, Edward?\" Monsieur de Fairhaven said.\n[1898-10-08 09:57:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward smiling as she said. I heard him say, \"How, you don't know that she first performed as Steven at home? Steven isn't particularly proud of that.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:57:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, but she was actually happy. Since we were talking about the actress, let me just say that it was she who first discovered the actress's weakness.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that she had seen her husband come in. \"I've had enough, now Steven should leave,\" she said, but didn't get up.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, upon hearing her words, people would comically believe she was going to a wedding with her tall, stout, aging husband, who was carefree and still lived like a young man, rather than imagine their long-standing, awkward relationship.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Samuel's round eyes, which looked like a black dot perfectly centered on the target, and this skilled marksman always aimed and hit the bullseye. I saw him direct his kind and sly, sunlit gaze toward a group of people sitting at the table drinking tea.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him move his feet with astonishment, slowly and cautiously, as if he were afraid of them, fearing to step on their skirts or disturb their conversation.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him with the smile of a good king of Yvetot, slightly drunk, his hand slightly bent, like a shark's fin swaying beside his chest, shaking hands impartially with his old friends or with strangers he had just been introduced to. In this way, he could respond to enthusiastic greetings without making a single move or stopping in his stride.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him move around the table with a kind and languid grace, as regal as a king. I heard him saying, \"Good night, dear, good night, friend, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Richard, good night, Argenteuil.\" He kept repeating it under his breath.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought Steven was the luckiest person when he approached Steven and, upon hearing Steven's name introduced, said something to Steven. \"I heard, 'Good night, Steven's little neighbor. Is your father well? He's such a good man! You know, Steven and he have become close friends.'\" To please Steven, he added another sentence.\n[1898-10-08 09:58:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him bow very deeply to Charles, who nodded to him andextended her hand from the pocket of her little apron.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that in an increasingly impoverished world, Samuel de Fairhaven was a real big shot, so identified with the idea of great wealth that he had become almost synonymous with it. I thought that in him, there was both the vanity of a nobleman and the self-importance of a wealthy man; the refined manners of the nobility precisely restrained the self-importance of the rich.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, after all, everyone knew that his success with women--which caused his wife suffering--was not entirely due to his family name and fortune, because he still looked very handsome, his profile as graceful and clean-cut as a Greek god.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:10] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Really? She performed at your house?' asked Monsieur de Guerendu to Edward.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:59:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Of course it's true! She came to recite, holding a bouquet of lilies, and her dress was also covered in lilies.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:59:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | Before Paul was forced to take Richard to the window for a conversation, Steven went back to the old diplomat and whispered that he wanted to talk to him about James's seat at the French Academy.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw he initially wanted to put off discussing the matter, but Steven disagreed. Steven said he was about to leave for Riverside. \"I heard, 'What! You're going to Riverside again? You've really become a world traveler!'\" Then he gave in.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard the name Le Rouvre-Bourriole, and Paul looked at Steven with a suspicious gaze. I thought that Steven might have said something unfavorable about James in front of Leuwen-Bourrienne, and I was worried that this economist might have told James what he had said.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him first grumbling and hesitating, then suddenly spitting out a sentence as if even he had not expected it. I thought suddenly that he had, in fact, shown genuine feelings for James, as if an irresistible conviction had destroyed his earlier hesitant and reluctant attempt to remain silent.\n[1898-10-08 09:59:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him excitedly saying to Steven. \"I heard, 'No, no! Your James shouldn't run. It's for his own good, for his interest, for the respect of his talent. He has great talent, and this kind of reckless venture would ruin him. His worth is far greater than that of being an academician of the French Academy.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:59:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard someone say, \"If he becomes an academician, he'll lose everything and gain nothing. Thank goodness, he's not a speaker. Steven's charming colleagues value speaking ability above all, even if what they say is nothing but clichés. Your father has more important goals in life; he should go straight ahead and not go prowling into thorny thickets to hunt, even if those thickets are the thorns of Plato's Academy, full of more pricks than flowers.\"\n[1898-10-08 09:59:55] The parlor of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'Besides, he can only get a few votes. The French Academy usually makes applicants wait for a while before admitting them. There's nothing much to do now. As for the future, Steven can't say.'\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'But it has to be the French Academy itself that approaches him. The French Academy blindly follows the principle of the neighbors across the Alps, 'farà da se,' but with more failures than successes. When Le Roux de Brie spoke about these things to Steven, he always looked unpleasant.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"In any case, Steven thinks he and your James might be on the same side, don't you? ...Steven made it clear to Leuwa-Bourieu that he only understood cotton and metal, as Unknown_Bismarck said, it's impossible to know what immeasurable factors might do. The most important thing is to persuade your James not to run for office: 'Resist the beginning.'\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:10] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"If he insists on his own way and makes his friends face the situation as it is, they'll be in a tough spot. Listen,\" he suddenly fixed his blue eyes on Steven and earnestly said, \"Steven loves your James very much. Steven wants to tell you something that will really surprise you.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'Ah! It's precisely because Steven likes him (Steven and he are two inseparable companions, Arcades ambo), and because he knows that if he stays in his position, he can serve the country and keep it from running aground. Out of friendship and respect, out of patriotism, Steven would never vote for him!\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Moreover, Steven believes that Steven had hinted to him. If Steven votes for him, it would mean Steven is not keeping his word.'\" I saw Steven in his eyes, as if I were seeing the solemn countenance of an Assyrian from Le Rouvre.\n[1898-10-08 10:00:25] The living room of Villeparisis | I recalled that in several conversations with Paul, he had repeatedly regarded his colleagues as old fossils, and for other reasons as well, since every member of a club or an academy sees his colleagues as people completely opposite to his own character.\n[1898-10-08 10:00:30] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard Steven say,\" he concluded, \"that for the sake of everyone's interests, Steven would rather your James win again in ten or fifteen years' time.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven had said this not out of jealousy, at least not lacking the spirit of helpfulness. But later, his words took on a different meaning in the same matter.\n[1898-10-08 10:00:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Samuel, do you know who Steven is talking about?' Edward said to her husband.\"",

She's not a real comedian, as Steven and his kind would say.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:00:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard \"You certainly never thought there could be someone more ridiculous than her.\" Edward then said to Monsieur de Fairhaven.\n[1898-10-08 10:00:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard Samuel interrupt his wife, saying, \"She even made people laugh at her.\" I thought of his peculiar way of speaking, which upper-class people would say didn't make him a fool, but intellectuals would consider the greatest fool.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Steven doesn't understand,' Edward continued, 'how Peter could have fallen in love with her. Ah! Steven knows this is something that shouldn't be discussed,\"\n[1898-10-08 10:01:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her say it, like a broad-minded and generous philosopher and a sensitive but now awakened dreamer, making a beautiful pout.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard her say, \"Steven knows that anyone can have love, and that this is actually the beauty of love, because it's precisely this that makes love seem 'enigmatic'.\" She went on to say. I thought that although she still ridiculed new literature, it might gradually seep into her mind through newspaper publicity or certain conversations.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:15] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Inexplicable! Ah, Steven's cousin, Steven admits, this is a bit hard for Steven to believe,' said Unknown_Argencourt.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:01:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"Yes, love is mysterious,\" Edward said again. She smiled with a gentle, endearing smile, the kind of a refined upper-class lady; at the same time, she also showed an unshakable conviction. I thought of the belief of Unknown_Wagner's female devotee, who assured a man in her circle that in *Die Walküre*, there was not only song but also love.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her smile sweetly and then said, so that her recent opinion was instantly overturned by her own explanation. \"I heard, 'After all, in reality, no one knows why a person loves another, perhaps it's not at all like what Steven and others think,\"\n[1898-10-08 10:01:30] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I know, in fact, people will never find out,\" she declared, her expression showing doubt and weariness. I heard, \"So, you see, it's better never to discuss who chose which lover; that might be wiser.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:01:35] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, but she immediately contradicted herself as soon as she proposed the principle, since she then criticized Peter's choice.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"You see, regardless of anything, Steven still believes it's surprising to find charm in an absurd person.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:01:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Richard had heard Steven and his friends talking about Peter, and that he had already begun in Willowbrook to speak ill of him, using such vile language that it made everyone extremely uncomfortable. I thought he had begun to hate people, and in revenge, he seemed unwilling to retreat in the face of any obstacle.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of how he had set down a principle that he considered himself to have lofty moral standards, and that everyone who belonged to the Bouillons Club—a sports club he believed was composed of refined and cultured people—deserved to be put in prison. Therefore, whatever method he used to discipline them was praiseworthy.\n[1898-10-08 10:01:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I know that once, he even claimed he wanted to sue a friend of his from the Riverside Club. In the lawsuit, he intended to give false testimony, but in such a way that it would be seamless, making it impossible for the defendant to prove it was perjury.\n[1898-10-08 10:02:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Richard, who had tried this very trick—though he never actually carried out the plan—to make his friend feel even more discouraged and humiliated. Since the person he wanted to undermine was someone who relentlessly pursued elegance, a member of the Riverside Club, and since any weapon could be used against such a person, especially someone like Richard, a saint, what was wrong with giving false testimony?\n[1898-10-08 10:02:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'But, you see, Matthew,' said Monsieur de Paul, objecting.\" I thought that he had finally understood the meaning of his cousin's words, and that she had been entirely right, which was shocking.\n[1898-10-08 10:02:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him struggling to recall an example that would prove that some women he did not like had indeed received the love of certain men.\n[1898-10-08 10:02:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Well! Matthew isn't like that,' Edward protested, 'but it's still incredible, because that woman is a lovely fool, but she wasn't funny before, and she was pretty.'\"\n[1898-10-08 10:02:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Hmph! Hmph!' and Charles softly hummed twice.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:02:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Ah! You think she's not beautiful? No, she was once very charming, with lovely eyes and beautiful hair. She used to dress very fashionably, and even now she doesn't look any worse. Steven admitted that she now makes people dislike her, but she was once a very lovely person.'\"\n[1898-10-08 10:02:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Even so, when Matthew married her, the Stevenes felt sorry for him, because he had no need to marry her at all.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:03:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I didn't think I had said anything remarkable, but when I saw Monsieur de Guerlac laughing heartily, I repeated it again. I thought she might have found the remark amusing, or perhaps found the person who laughed quite endearing.\n[1898-10-08 10:03:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her begin to look at M. de Fairhaven with tender eyes, wanting to add another layer of emotion to her intellectual charm.\n[1898-10-08 10:03:15] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'You're right, there's no need to marry her. But she's still charming, someone loves her. Steven completely understands.'\" She went on to say.\n[1898-10-08 10:03:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'But the lady from Peter, Steven assures you, her appearance is so funny that it would make you lose your front teeth from laughing.' Steven knew someone would counter with the cliché of Augier: 'If the wine intoxicates, who cares what bottle it's in?' Ah! Peter was indeed drunk, but he certainly lacked refined taste when it came to choosing his bottle!\"\n[1898-10-08 10:03:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"First, imagine that she actually asked Steven to put a staircase in the middle of the drawing room. That's not terribly dull? And she also announced to Steven that she was going to throw herself down the steps. Besides, if you had heard her recite, you would understand. Steven saw her perform only once, but he thought the play was absolutely beyond belief. It was called The Artifact.\"\n[1898-10-08 10:03:30] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'The Artifact'? Oh, is that so? Is that so? How trendy! Oh! Wait a minute, Steven knows this play from start to finish. The author sent the script to the king, and after reading it, the king didn't understand a thing, seemed completely lost, and asked Steven to explain it to him.\" Mr. de Guerchy exclaimed in surprise.",

Since Steven and all of you have become accustomed to things, you can have a piece of cream cake, which looks very delicious.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:23:08] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard \"The gentleman plays the waitress so convincingly.\" Monsieur de Guerande made a joke in the style of Charles.\n[1898-10-09 10:23:13] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the archivist bring the pastry to the Jansenist historian.\n[1898-10-09 10:23:18] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the historian of the Fronde tremblingly trying to win everyone's favor. I heard, \"You've done very well.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:23:23] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that, so he cast a furtive glance at the others who had also flattered him, as if trying to make an understanding with them.\n[1898-10-09 10:23:28] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Please tell Steven, Steven's kind aunt,' \" Samuel asked Charles, \"the distinguished gentleman who just came in with Steven—do you know who that was?

I thought that he knew that his wife's humor needed to be stimulated by reasonable paradoxes, such as not comparing a woman to a cow, for instance, and in this way, Edward would come up with a funnier, more amusing, and more original remark than the first metaphor.\n[1898-10-09 10:24:03] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Samuel innocently volunteering, quietly helping his wife shine, like a secret accomplice in a train compartment secretly aiding a gambler at a card game.\n[1898-10-09 10:24:08] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard Edward say loudly, \"Steven admitted she wasn't like a cow, because she was like a whole herd of cows,\" \"Steven swore to you that when Steven saw this herd of cows wearing hats entering Steven's living room to greet Steven, Steven didn't know what to say.\"",

Moreover, she launched a fierce attack on Steven from a distance, which was very artistic. I didn't know when it started, but she had been continuously sending Steven business cards.\n[1898-10-09 10:24:23] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that Steven's house was full of her business cards, none of the furniture was without one, as if they were product advertisements.

I thought this probably indicated that Paul was a fervent opponent of retrials.\n[1898-10-09 10:25:08] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw how Richard, seeing the ambassador's amiable attitude, pretended to believe that his interlocutor was right. I thought he had no doubt that we shared the same views, and that he wanted to join hands with me to condemn the government.\n[1898-10-09 10:25:13] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that at this moment Steven saw his vanity being satisfied, and his curiosity became even stronger.\n[1898-10-09 10:25:18] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself: What was the important issue that Paul had not explicitly stated but seemed to imply that they agreed on?\n[1898-10-09 10:25:23] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I wondered where his views on the Unknown_Dreyfus case actually coincided with my own?\n[1898-10-09 10:25:28] The living room of Villeparisis | I was particularly surprised by Richard, as the mysterious agreement between him and Monsieur Paul seemed to be more than just political.\n[1898-10-09 10:25:33] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Charles had already given Paul a detailed account of his literary works.\n[1898-10-09 10:25:38] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I see you don't follow the trends,\" the former ambassador said to Richard, \"so Steven has to congratulate you.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:25:43] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"In this day and age, impartial research no longer exists; they just peddle obscene or ridiculous trash to the public, but you don't.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:25:48] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"If the Stevenes had a good government, your efforts would certainly deserve encouragement.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:25:53] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven watching Richard, who wasarrogant because he alone had escaped this world-wide catastrophe.\n[1898-10-09 10:25:58] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about it, but on this matter, he still wanted details; he wanted to know what kind of absurd thing Paul had been talking about.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:03] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Richard felt his way of creating was not much different from others', and he didn't consider it special in any way.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:08] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him return to the Unknown_Dreyfus case. I thought about it, but he could not clarify Paul's point.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:13] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him trying hard to get him to talk about the officer whose name was often mentioned in the press.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:18] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven considered them more remarkable than the political figures involved in the case, because the political figures were already well known, while the officers were unknown.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:23] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw them in uniform, just emerged from an entirely different life, breaking the strict silence that had been maintained.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:28] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of them as if they were Lohengrin emerging from a basket guided by swans, arousing endless curiosity.\n[1898-10-09 10:26:33] The living room of Villeparisis | I know that Richard knew a nationalist lawyer, and thanks to this lawyer, he was able to attend the trial of the Zola case several times.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:03] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him carrying a sandwich and a bottle of coffee, arriving there early in the morning and not coming out until evening. I knew it was like going to take the entrance exam for the lycée or the composition contest for the baccalaureate.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:08] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about how the change in habits had made his nerves unusually excited, and coffee along with the exciting trial had pushed his passionate emotions to their peak.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:13] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought about how, after leaving the court, he still couldn't stop thinking about everything that had happened there, and even when he returned home at night, he still longed to return to that beautiful dream.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:18] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him run to the restaurant where both sides often gathered, looking for people who shared his views, and then endlessly discussing what had happened during the day with them.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:23] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him speak in a commanding tone to have a late-night snack brought to him, to compensate for the fatigue and hunger caused by a day that had started early and had no meal in between. I thought it made him imagine himself giving orders.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:28] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that people always live between actual experience and imagination, and for the people known to Steven, one always wants to delve into the guesswork of how they live.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:33] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of those Stevenes, whose lives one could only guess at, and I longed to know them.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:38] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul answer Richard's question.\n[1898-10-09 10:28:43] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that two officers had become involved in the case. Steven had once heard someone talk about them. That person was Monsieur de Mirabel, whose judgment Steven trusted, and who had a high regard for the two officers.\"",

I heard, \"What are they talking about over there?\"\n[1898-10-09 10:29:23] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard the words \"Unknown_Dreyfus case.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:29:28] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Ah! Damn it! By the way, do you know who the most fervent defender of Unknown_Dreyfus is? You'll never guess. It's Steven's nephew Peter!\"\n[1898-10-09 10:29:33] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"Steven can tell you that when the people from the The Union heard about his 'glorious achievements,' they all turned on him and rained down abuse on him. Next week, he's going to take part in...\"\n[1898-10-09 10:29:38] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward interject. I heard, \"Of course, if they were all like Gilbert, insisting on sending all the Jews back to Jerusalem...\"\n[1898-10-09 10:29:43] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Monsieur de Fairhaven interrupt Edward. I heard, \"Ah! So, the Prince de Fairhaven agrees with Steven's opinion.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:29:48] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Samuel often used his wife as a showpiece, but he didn't really love her.\n[1898-10-09 10:29:53] The parlor of Villeparisis | I knew he \"valued only Steven,\" hated being interrupted when speaking, and moreover, at home he was always brutal to his wife.\n[1898-10-09 10:29:58] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him, seeing that his wife not only didn't listen to him but also interrupted him. I know that I am a bad husband and a smooth-talking man.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:03] The living room of Villeparisis | I couldn't help but feel ashamed and angry when I saw him, my whole body trembling, so I immediately stopped speaking and gave Edward a fierce look that left everyone around me bewildered and confused.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:08] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I don't understand how you came up with the idea of talking to Steven about Gilbert and Jerusalem,\" he finally said again, \"it's completely irrelevant.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:30:13] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that he had softened his tone a bit and said. I heard, \"But you must agree that if someone in Steven's family got expelled from the The Union, especially Peter, since his father was president there for ten years, it would ultimately be a disgraceful thing.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:30:18] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Steven, what can be done, dear? This made those people very angry, they were all fuming. Steven can't blame them.'\"\n[1898-10-09 10:30:23] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"You know, Steven himself has no racial prejudice. Steven thinks racial prejudice is out of date, and Steven wants to keep up with the times.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:30:28] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"But damn it, when a man has the title of Marquis de Peter, he shouldn't be a revisionist! What does Steven have to say to you, anyway!\"\n[1898-10-09 10:30:33] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Samuel speaking the words \"when a man has the title of Marquis de Peter\" with an exaggerated tone.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:38] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but he clearly knew that a man with the title \"Germant Samuel\" was even more distinguished.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:43] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but if his pride made him want to exaggerate the superiority of Christopher over Samuel, then his imagination was even more inclined to lower Samuel's title, driven by a more refined sense of taste.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:48] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of everyone like that, always looking at the other mountain and finding the wild flower more fragrant than the one at home. This universal law of imagination, which applies to everyone, also applied to Samuel.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:53] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that not only the laws of imagination applied, but language as well.\n[1898-10-09 10:30:58] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that neither of the two laws of language was applicable here.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:03] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of one of the requirements that a person's speech should conform to the class of his thoughts, not to the social class he belongs to.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:08] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, therefore, even when Samuel spoke about the nobility, his manner of speaking might well be like that of an ordinary bourgeois, and he might say things like \"when a person has the title of Fairhaven, like Samuel,\" just as they would.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:13] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of a man of letters, someone like Matthew or Thomas, who would never say such a thing.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:18] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of a Samuel, who, even if he wrote about the customs of the upper class, would end up producing a novel full of bourgeois smells, and here, the noble titles were completely useless.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:23] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of a novel written by an ordinary man that could bear the title of a nobleman.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:28] The living room of Villeparisis | I wondered whether even Samuel himself could remember which bourgeois had said the phrase \"when a person has... a title.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:31:33] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought about it, but another rule of language requires that new expressions occasionally emerge, like certain diseases that appear and then quickly disappear, never to be mentioned again.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:38] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that at the same time, people could use these expressions without any prior agreement, yet no one knew their origin—perhaps they had arisen naturally, or perhaps by chance.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:43] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of it like an American weed, whose seeds once accidentally stuck to the fibers of a travel rug, then fell onto a railway embankment in France, where it sprouted and grew.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:48] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I know, however, that once, when Richard was talking about himself to Steven, he said a sentence that I've heard Steven himself later hear from strangers—“The most charming, the most outstanding, the most respected, and the most demanding people discover that there is only one person they consider absolutely brilliant, likable, and indispensable: Steven Richard.” Steven had also heard similar words from people he didn't know, except that they had substituted their own names in place of Richard's.\n[1898-10-09 10:31:53] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, after hearing the phrase \"when a person has the title of...\", what could possibly be surprising?\n[1898-10-09 10:31:58] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard Samuel continue, 'What do you want Steven to say? Racial prejudice is in control there, so it's not hard to understand.'\"\n[1898-10-09 10:32:03] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard her say, 'That's especially funny,' Edward replied, 'she Robert strongly opposed the retrial, constantly nagging Steven and the others about the French Patriotic League, how could it have no effect on him?'\"",

Isn't there also an improper woman?\"\n[1898-10-09 10:32:13] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"A woman of the worst character, the most corrupt woman, she had a greater influence on him, and she happened to be a compatriot of Mr. Unknown_Dreyfus. She transmitted her mental state to Peter.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:32:18] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard the archivist say, 'Mr. Samuel, you probably don't yet know that a new word can be used to express this state of mind.'\" I knew he was the secretary of the Anti-Rehabilitation Committee.\n[1898-10-09 10:32:23] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"Using the word 'mental state'—it means exactly the same thing as 'state of mind,' but at least no one understands it. That's the whole point, as someone once said, it's the 'most fashionable' word.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:32:28] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that, however, the archivist had just heard the Jewish name Richard, and now was again seeing him asking Paul a question. I looked and thus showed an anxious expression.\n[1898-10-09 10:32:33] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles also become anxious and uneasy, as if sitting on pins and needles. I thought it was just a matter of different reasons.\n[1898-10-09 10:32:38] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles trembling before the archivist, pretending to oppose the retrial. I thought of how she would be blamed for receiving a Jew who had some connection with the \"Union.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:32:43] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Ah! Mental state, Steven must write it down, Steven will need it later,' \" Samuel said.\n[1898-10-09 10:32:48] The living room of Villeparisis | I know (this isn't posturing, Samuel really did have a little notebook filled with \"quotations,\" and after every major banquet he would review it again.)\n[1898-10-09 10:33:08] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that Steven liked the word. After many such new words appeared, they soon disappeared. Recently, Steven read a sentence that described a writer as having \"talent.\" You could interpret it any way you wanted. Later, Steven never saw that word again.\n[1898-10-09 10:33:13] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the historian of the Fronde insert a remark. I heard the phrase \"mental state is broader in scope than talent,\" and Steven, who was a member of a committee under the Ministry of Public Education, had heard people use that word many times there.\n[1898-10-09 10:33:18] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that Steven had been mentioned in Steven's own circle, that is, the Verneuil circle, and even at a dinner party at Mr. Émile Olivier's.\n[1898-10-09 10:33:23] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Samuel pretend to be humble in his reply, yet he was clearly full of self-confidence. I heard, \"Steven doesn't have that honor; Steven isn't a member of the Ministry of Public Instruction.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:33:28] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw his mouth couldn't help but smile, and his eyes couldn't help but cast a proud glance toward the audience. I saw Steven, who had been caught by Samuel's mocking glance, turn red with shame.\n[1898-10-09 10:33:38] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him repeating it with self-satisfaction, slowly and deliberately. I heard, \"Steven doesn't have that honor. Steven isn't a member of the Ministry of Public Instruction, nor is he part of the Voulanges circle (Steven is only a member of the horse racing association and the club)...\"\n[1898-10-09 10:33:43] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him ask the historian, \"Sir, didn't you attend the The Union?\"\n[1898-10-09 10:33:48] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the historian trembling involuntarily. I thought he had sensed the arrogance in Samuel's words, but he was bewildered and didn't understand.\n[1898-10-09 10:33:53] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven doesn't go to Monsieur Émile Oliver's for dinner either. Steven admits that Steven doesn't know his mental state.

Steven intends to remain forever a fortunate outsider like this.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:34:23] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard \"but on the other hand, Steven found the behavior of Marie Hennard and Victorine Duret really unbearable, forcing the Stevenes to be in the company of a whole bunch of women named Durlan or Dubois, whom the Stevenes didn't know at all,\"\n[1898-10-09 10:34:28] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard \"they say they're very smart, they don't buy anything from Jewish merchants, their little parasols have 'Death to Jews' written on them, and so on.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:34:33] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that \"the day before yesterday, Steven went to Marie Hanser's house. In the past, her gatherings were very attractive. But now, there are only people that Steven would have wanted to avoid all his life, simply because they hated Unknown_Dreyfus and had gathered there. Some people were even worse.\"\n[1898-10-09 10:34:38] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'No, it's the wife of the Minister of War. At least that's how it's said in the ladies' private salons,'\" Samuel added.\n[1898-10-10 10:39:47] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about how, in his speeches, he often liked to use expressions he considered to be from the old regime.\n[1898-10-10 10:39:52] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"However, as is well known, Steven's personal opinion is completely opposite to that of his cousin Hillbert.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:39:57] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven isn't the kind of lord who would refuse to walk with a black man if that black man was Steven's friend; Steven didn't care at all what third parties or fourth parties thought.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:40:02] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'But you must admit that when a person has the title of Marquis de Peter, he can't make such a joke, he can't go against the opinions of the crowd, or those of people with more thought than Voltaire, even more than Steven's cousin.'\"\n[1898-10-10 10:40:07] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Especially since he's going to be running for the The Union in a week, now is definitely not the time for that foolish stunt Steven calls walking a tightrope!

I heard \"Did you hear the words Edward used?\" asked Samuel greedily of Charles.\n[1898-10-10 10:41:22] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Yes, Steven found it funny.'\"\n[1898-10-10 10:41:27] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Hi, Steven doesn't find it funny. More precisely, whether it's funny or not doesn't matter to Steven, because Steven isn't interested in jokes at all.'\" I thought Samuel's answer was unsatisfying.\n[1898-10-10 10:41:32] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw M. de Argenteuil express a different opinion.\n[1898-10-10 10:41:42] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I always speak without thinking,\" Edward muttered softly.\n[1898-10-10 10:41:47] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that Steven had been a parliamentarian and had heard many excellent but utterly meaningless speeches. Steven learned to appreciate the logic of speeches. Perhaps because of that, Steven later lost his election. The ridiculous meant nothing to Steven.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:41:52] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Samuel, you don't have to play Joseph Prudhomme anymore. Steven's child, you know, no one likes jokes as much as you do.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:41:57] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard someone say, \"Let Steven finish speaking. It's precisely because Steven is insensitive to a certain type of joke that he values his wife's humor all the more. Her humor often comes from correct observations. She speaks like a man and uses words like a writer.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:02] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven watching Richard try every trick to get Paul to talk about Unknown_Picquart.\n[1898-10-10 10:42:07] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard Paul say, 'As long as the government believes there is something suspicious here, there must necessarily be the colonel's testimony.'\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:12] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard that Steven knew, and it was precisely because Steven supported this view that several of his colleagues had become furious. But in Steven's opinion, the government should let the major speak.\n[1898-10-10 10:42:17] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"If the government keeps avoiding the issue, it will be unable to escape the crisis and will instead sink deeper into the mire. The testimony at the first trial was very favorable to the major.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:22] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard \"when he walked into the courtroom in his military uniform, speaking about his experiences and opinions in an extremely simple and straightforward manner,\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:27] The drawing room of Villeparisis | When he said, \"Steven swore on the honor of a soldier\" (his voice slightly trembled with patriotic fervor), Steven believed it without doubt — there was no denying that he made an extremely strong impression.\n[1898-10-10 10:42:32] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"Well, it seems he's a revisionist, there's no longer any doubt about it.\" Richard thought to himself.\n[1898-10-10 10:42:37] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard: \"But the confrontation with the archivist Gribbin immediately turned all the sympathy he had initially won into complete hostility:\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:42] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul earnestly and forcefully emphasize the following words. I heard, \"When people heard this old servant, this man of his word, speaking,\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:47] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"When people saw that he dared to look his superior in the face, not afraid to confront him, and said in an unchallengeable tone, 'You see, Colonel, you know that Steven has never told a lie in his life, and you know that at this moment, Steven is telling the truth as he always does,' \" and at that moment, everyone's opinion changed.\n[1898-10-10 10:42:52] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"In the following trials, Monsieur Bical tried everything he could, but couldn't reverse the outcome.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:42:57] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"No, he must be against the retrial, which is expected.\" Richard thought to himself.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:02] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"But if he believed that Cottard was a lying traitor, how could he have valued and quoted his revelations, as if they were charming and credible?\"\n[1898-10-10 10:43:07] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"If he had regarded Biche as an honest and straightforward man, how could he have suspected him of lying when he confronted him with Griban?\"\n[1898-10-10 10:43:12] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Paul talking to Richard like that, as if they agreed on everything, which probably was because he was a thoroughgoing opponent of retrials.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:17] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that his stance against the retrial was not firm enough, and so I became an enemy of the government, just like the retrial supporters.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:22] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that perhaps it was also because his political goals, which he had set for himself, had a deeper content, not at home but abroad; the reformists were merely a trivial and insignificant form, not worth troubling a patriot with great diplomatic concerns.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:27] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, more accurately, perhaps because his prudent political maxim applied only to matters of form, procedure, and opportunity, but proved helpless when it came to substantive issues.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:32] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that just as in philosophy, pure logic could not solve the problem of existence, or perhaps because his prudent political mind felt that discussing such issues was risky, so for the sake of caution, he preferred to talk about trivial, insignificant matters.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:37] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, but Richard was wrong in assuming that even if Paul had not been so cautious, or had not been so resolute in his opinions, he would have nonetheless, if he had wanted to, told him about the roles of Henry, Bical, and D'Albaret de Cramm, as well as the details of the case.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:42] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that in fact, Richard could not possibly suspect Paul of knowing the truth, since, given his contacts with the ministers, how could he not be aware of it?\n[1898-10-10 10:43:47] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, of course, that Richard believed the truth of politics could be generally analyzed by the most lucid minds.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:52] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that, but like most citizens, he imagined that this truth would forever remain unquestionably and concretely in the secret files of the president of the Republic and the prime minister, and that the president and the prime minister would certainly inform all the ministers of the real situation.\n[1898-10-10 10:43:57] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but even though the truth of politics has some relation to documents, these documents were worth nothing compared to an X-ray.",

In Steven's opinion, publicly denying it would be unnecessary.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:45:27] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"But the Minister of War only clearly expressed his views in casual conversation over tea and wine. Besides, some issues must be handled carefully; if they cause unrest, it could lead to an uncontrollable situation.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:45:32] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'But these pieces of evidence are obviously fake,' said Richard.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:45:37] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul remain silent, but he claimed he disapproved of Prince Henry of Orleans shouting so loudly in court.\n[1898-10-10 10:45:42] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Besides, what he's doing will only disrupt the court, cause a commotion, and such a commotion is regrettable in every way.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:45:47] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Of course, the Marceaux must stop the anti-militarist conspiracy, but the Marceaux don't need to be provoked into a fight by the right wing.'\"\n[1898-10-10 10:45:52] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"The right wing does not encourage the people's patriotism, but instead uses the people's patriotic enthusiasm.

Steven just meant that a family can have a political awareness in this regard.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:46:47] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that \"this awareness, the Stevenes saw it reaching its peak in the admirable Princess Clementina, and her son, Prince Ferdinand, inherited it like a precious legacy. The Prince of Bulgaria would never have embraced Major Esteban like that.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:46:52] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'he would rather hold a common soldier.'

He's like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau, always talking about the 'Nine Muses of Literature.'\"\n[1898-10-10 10:47:57] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"This is rare among today's young people, and even more so among the previous generation. People like Steven were once a bit romantic.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:48:02] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but even if he felt a sense of novelty in the speaker, he still thought the conversation had gone on too long.\n[1898-10-10 10:48:07] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles respond with the attractive smile of an elderly woman. I heard, \"No, sir, Steven is no longer attending the balls.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:48:12] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her say it again, her eyes fixed on her friends Chatel and Samuel and Richard. I heard, \"Are you all going? It's what people of your age do.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:48:17] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her jokingly pretending to be proud. I heard, \"Steven has also been invited; they even came to fetch Steven personally.\" I knew (the \"they\" refers to the Princess de Sagan.)\n[1898-10-10 10:48:22] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that Steven didn't have an invitation,\" Richard said. I thought that Charles might send him one.\n[1898-10-10 10:48:27] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that since Madame de Saingon had personally come to invite her, she wouldn't have turned away one of her friends.\n[1898-10-10 10:48:32] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Charles showed no reaction, so Richard said no more.\n[1898-10-10 10:48:42] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew he had a more serious matter to discuss with her, and he had already asked her to receive him again two days later.\n[1898-10-10 10:49:02] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew he had heard the other two young men say they had left the circle on King's Street.

Steven thought you knew,' \" Richard said. I thought that Edward was telling the truth.\n[1898-10-10 10:50:02] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that Richard still couldn't let go of Unknown_Dreyfus, and he asked Paul a whole series of questions.\n[1898-10-10 10:50:12] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul was helpless and had to answer him. I heard that Paul's \"first\" impression of Steven was that Colonel D'Albertain de Cramme was a bit confused and not particularly suitable for handling the case.\n[1898-10-10 10:50:17] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard the words, \"An affair of this kind requires an extremely calm mind, a high degree of judgment, and specialized knowledge.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:50:22] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard that \"Steven knows that the Socialists are strongly demanding the execution of Colonel Dibert and the immediate release of the prisoners on Greenwood.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:50:27] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"But Steven thought, Steven and his kind were not yet reduced to the point where people like Chéruel de Lys could abuse them at will. This case still hasn't been cleared up.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:50:32] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Steven doesn't say there's nothing rather despicable to hide on both sides.

The consequences are obvious. Asking for a retrial is nothing more than walking through an open door, it's effortless.'\"\n[1898-10-10 10:50:47] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"At that point, the government should know it must boldly take a stand, otherwise it will have to give up its main power.

I thought that perhaps, like everyone else, he instinctively sought the other person's support when speaking.\n[1898-10-10 10:52:02] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"The government's actions should not be influenced by the promises made by certain people, no matter who is making them. Thank goodness, the current government is neither under the control of Colonel Unknown_Dreyfus on the right nor Mr. Clemenceau on the left.\"\n[1898-10-10 10:52:07] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"We should take a firm stance against those professional troublemakers and not let them rise again.

I thought that Steven hadn't heard, probably because of Richard's religious beliefs.\n[1898-10-11 10:58:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw a hesitant and affected expression flicker across Edward's face at that moment.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, who knew that a gossipy person, when afraid of being overheard, would speak in this hesitant, affected way; and it was also mixed with a kind of malicious pleasure, the sort one feels when facing a group of strangers, out of curiosity.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that, in order to save face, Richard turned to Unknown_Chatellerault and said. \"I heard him say, 'Sir, you're French, so you must know that foreigners are all conservatives, even though everyone says the French never know anything that happens outside of France. Besides, Steven knows he can still talk to you, Peter told Steven.'\"\n[1898-10-11 10:59:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but young Samuel, feeling that everyone was against Richard, acted in the cowardly way that was all too common in social circles, using the perhaps hereditary talent for affected and sarcastic wit he had presumably inherited from M. de Charlus.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"Sir, please forgive me, Steven cannot discuss Unknown_Dreyfus with you. However, Steven's principle is that this case can only be discussed among the descendants of Japheth.\" To Richard.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw everyone laughing, but Richard didn't smile. I thought it wasn't that he was unaccustomed to making a few mocking remarks about his Jewish heritage, or about his ancestry connected in some way to the Sinai Peninsula.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but when he triggered the language mechanism inside him, what reached his lips was not a sarcastic remark (perhaps it wasn't yet ready), but another one.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard \"How did you know? Who told you?\" and that was all I thought that Steven would find it rather like the words of a criminal's son.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, in addition, because he had a name that immediately revealed he wasn't a Christian, and because he had a distinctive face, his surprise seemed somewhat naive.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Richard wasn't satisfied with what he had said to Paul, so he went over to the archivist and asked whether Monsieur D'Albaret de Cram or Monsieur Joseph Reinach occasionally visited Charles.\n[1898-10-11 10:59:56] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the archivist not answering. I knew he was against the retrial, and he kept preaching in Charles that a social war was about to break out, warning her to be especially careful about the people she associated with.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I immediately repeated to Charles the question Richard had just asked. I thought to myself that he was probably a secret agent sent by the union to investigate the situation.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Charles considered Richard to at least lack manners, and this might even endanger Paul's position.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew (every morning, he read to her the articles that M. Xudai published in the Petit Journal). I thought about it until she decided to fulfill the archivist's wish, he was the only one who frightened her, and the only one who had ever instilled some sort of idea in her, though not successfully.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that, therefore, she wanted to hint to Richard that he shouldn't come anymore.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of how, in her social repertoire, she naturally found a way to get rid of a guest by playing the role of a lady who dismisses someone, and this performance would certainly not result in the sort of outburst that Steven and others might imagine.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that when Richard came over to say goodbye, she was deeply sunk into the big armchair, looking drowsy, half-awake. I saw her bewildered gaze, like the gleam of a pearl—faint yet enchanting.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | When I saw Richard leaving, Charles forced a faint, listless smile onto his face, but said nothing and didn't even offer his hand.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the scene astonish Richard, but since everyone around was watching, he realized continuing it would be of no benefit to him. Since Charles didn't extend his hand, he himself reached out.\n[1898-10-11 11:00:56] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that this had offended Charles, so she pretended not to see me, lowering her eyelids and keeping her eyes half-open, half-closed. I thought, but although she very much wanted to satisfy the archivist and the anti-revisionist circle's desires, she also had to think about the future.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Richard say to the archivist. I heard \"Steven thinks she's asleep.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:01:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the archivist and thought Charles was standing up for himself with confidence, so I pretended to be angry.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Richard speaking loudly. I heard \"Goodbye, Madame.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:01:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles slightly move his lips, like a dying man who wants to speak but can no longer recognize anyone with his eyes.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | When Richard left, having convinced himself that she was suffering from intellectual decline, she immediately turned her face toward the Marquis de Paul.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that a few days later, Richard, driven by curiosity and the desire to understand a strange event, came to visit Charles again.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles receive him with warm hospitality. I thought that she was a kind woman, and besides, the archivist wasn't there, and she also didn't want to give up the one-act play that Richard had promised to organize at her house.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that her performance that night made a sensation in all the salons, and was universally praised and discussed, though it had already been distorted beyond recognition. I thought, after all, she had only played a role, that of the lady she longed to be.\n[1898-10-11 11:01:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Edward, you were just talking about The Artifact. You know (Steven isn't any more proud of it), this... how should I say... the author of this petition is still a fellow countryman of Steven's.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:01:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw M. de Paul saying it, with a touch of pride, because he knew better than anyone else the author of the play just discussed. \"I heard, 'Yes, he's Belgian, according to his ID card.' He added another sentence.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:01:56] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Is that true? However, the Stevenes didn't accuse you of any responsibility in The Artifact. Fortunately, you are completely different from you and your fellow countrymen, and the author of this absurd work.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:02:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven knows some nice Belgians, you're one of them, and your king, although timid, is thoughtful, and Steven's cousins from Liège, and many others.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:02:06] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'But thank goodness you don't speak the same language as the author of The Artifact. Besides, Steven told you plainly not to mention such people at all, because they're worth nothing.'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:02:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard her say, \"They try to speak in obscure and difficult words, and when necessary, they deliberately act ridiculous in order to hide their empty minds. If there's anything hidden here, Steven can tell you, it's sheer audacity,\" she said seriously.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard her say, \"Where there is thought, there will be recklessness. Steven doesn't know whether you've seen Borelli's play. Many people frown when they see it. As for Steven, he'd even risk drawing criticism,\" she added again. I thought, but how could I know she would take no risk at all.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven actually admitted it; Steven found the play quite interesting. But what are The Artifact? Even though one of them was very kind to Steven's nephew, Steven couldn't make the family feel... \"\n[1898-10-11 11:02:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward suddenly stop speaking because a lady had entered, the Viscountess of Unknown_Marsantes. I knew that Unknown_Marsantes was one of the finest men in the Saint-Germain district, angelically kind and obedient.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven had already heard about it from others, but Steven was not particularly surprised by this statement, because at that time Steven did not yet know that she was the sister of Goulemande Samuel.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I know that later, within the Saint-Germain circle, whenever Steven heard of women who were as sorrowful, pure, self-sacrificing, and respected as the flawless female saints on stained glass windows, he would think how they were like two fruits on the same tree as their rude, dissolute, and despicable brothers. The thought of Steven filled me with an indescribable surprise.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven believed, since brothers and sisters look alike, such as the Unknown_Marsantes who resemble Goulemand Samuel, their intelligence and character should also be the same.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that just as a person can have good luck or bad luck, someone with a narrow mind could never have a broad heart, and a cruel person could never have a noble, selfless Steven-like spirit.\n[1898-10-11 11:02:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Unknown_Marsantes had been a pupil of Brunetière, and she had captivated the people of Saint-Germain, while also gently influencing them through the saintly way she lived.",

    "text": "[1898-10-11 11:03:16] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw, but Steven noticed that her face was identical to her Samuel brothers', both having beautiful noses and sharp eyes.\n[1898-10-11 11:03:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about the resemblance in appearance, which made Steven believe that she should also share Samuel's intelligence and moral views.\n[1898-10-11 11:03:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven could never believe that, simply because she was a woman, perhaps had suffered misfortune, and had received general approval, she could be so different from her family.\n[1898-10-11 11:03:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of how, like in the medieval chivalric poems, all the virtues and charm were concentrated in the younger sister, while her brother was always a cruel and wicked demon.\n[1898-10-11 11:03:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, in Steven's view, nature would not have the freedom of ancient poets, but rather it would specifically take advantage of a family's common characteristics.\n[1898-10-11 11:03:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven would not believe that it could have such innovative spirit, using the materials for making fools or rough men to shape a clever man who does no foolish things, or a pure woman saint.\n[1898-10-11 11:03:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven seeing Unknown_Marsantes wearing a white silk dress with large palm leaf patterns, adorned with black flowers that contrasted beautifully with the palm leaves.\n[1898-10-11 11:04:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that because three weeks ago her cousin, Monsieur de Montmorency, had died, but this did not prevent her from attending social gatherings and small dinners—she simply wore mourning.\n[1898-10-11 11:04:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew she was a noble woman. I thought of the generations that had left a deep imprint of frivolous court life on her soul--whether it was shallow or strict, it had left its mark.\n[1898-10-11 11:04:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Unknown_Marsantes, who, after her parents' death, didn't have the strength to remain in grief for long, but for the death of a cousin, she absolutely refused to wear bright-colored clothes for a whole month.\n[1898-10-11 11:04:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw how she was very polite to Steven. I knew that first, Steven was a friend of Peter, and second, that Steven and Peter did not belong to the same world.\n[1898-10-11 11:04:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that her politeness was mixed with a certain feigned shyness, and her voice, her gaze, and her thoughts occasionally showed a tendency to retreat.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of it as pulling a dress that had been stretched too tight back toward me, not letting it take up too much space, so that it would appear both soft and smooth, as good education demanded.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, however, that one should not take the notion of good education too literally, for among these ladies, many soon fell into depravity, yet they maintained, almost childishly, an air of refined elegance in their words and behavior.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I found Unknown_Marsantes's way of speaking uncomfortable, because whenever she spoke to a commoner, like Christopher or George, she would enunciate each word very clearly in order to emphasize it.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her speak in the monotonous, two-toned manner characteristic of the Fairhaven family. \"I heard that Steven felt honored, very honored, to have met Monsieur Christopher and to have known George.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:05:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought it might be to make people admire her modesty, or perhaps because she shared Samuel's same habit of using outdated forms of language, as a protest against the bad education that no longer used expressions like \"honor.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:05:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that no matter what the reason, it made one feel that when Unknown_Marsantes said something like \"Steven is honored, very honored,\" she was playing an important role in her own mind, proving to herself that she understood how to show respect to prominent people.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that even if she met these celebrities outside her castle, she would welcome them as warmly as she did inside.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought further that her family was an old and noble house, and she loved it deeply. At the same time, she wanted to make people understand her family's relationships through a slow, detailed account and explanations.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her, wherever she went, recounting to people the noble European families that had declined since the days of the Holy Roman Empire. I knew (nothing particularly surprising, just the usual stories about pitiful peasants and noble hunters).\n[1898-10-11 11:05:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that those not very smart wouldn't forgive her, but if they had any knowledge at all, they would laugh at her as if she were a fool.\n[1898-10-11 11:05:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that in the country, Unknown_Marsantes was revered for his generosity.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I know, especially because of her pure and unadulterated noble lineage (such pure bloodlines have long since become extinct, I suppose only in French history could one find anything like it). I thought that her behavior was free from the affectation that common people would call \"putting on airs,\" and instead appeared simple, unpretentious, and graceful.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her not afraid to embrace an unfortunate, poor woman, and send her to the castle to fetch a load of firewood.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that it was said she was a perfect Christian, and she was determined to marry Peter to a daughter of a wealthy family. I thought that since she was a lady, she should act like one, and in a way, she should appear simple and unassuming.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I realized this was an expensive gamble, because only when others know you can be unplain, that is, when they know you are very rich, can your pretended plainness make them kneel in admiration.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I'm sure you found her charming,\" I heard. Later, when Steven spoke to someone about having met her, the person asked Steven.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that true beauty was so particular, so new, that Steven could not see it as beauty.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that day, Steven thought to himself, she had a small nose, bright blue eyes, a slender neck, and an air of melancholy.\n[1898-10-11 11:06:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Listen,' Charles say to Goulmont Edward, 'Steven thinks that in a while, a woman you don't want to associate with will come to see Steven. It would be better for Steven to greet you first, so you aren't taken by surprise.'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:07:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"But you can rest assured, she won't be coming again, but today we'll make an exception and let her come. It's Matthew's wife.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:07:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that John, worried that the Unknown_Dreyfus affair would grow worse and that her husband's Jewish heritage might bring her trouble, had long since begged Matthew not to speak of Unknown_Dreyfus's innocence under any circumstances.\n[1898-10-11 11:07:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that when Matthew was not with her, she became even more extreme, openly advocating the most fervent nationalism.",

But Steven would recognize her and leave promptly.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I have Steven assure you, Edward, that she is very likable, a remarkable woman,\" Unknown_Marsantes said.\n[1898-10-11 11:09:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven doesn't suspect, but feels there's no need for Steven to confirm it himself.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard Charles ask Edward, \"Have you received Madame Israël's invitation?\" in an attempt to change the subject.\n[1898-10-11 11:09:16] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Ah! Thank God, Steven doesn't know her,' Edward answered, 'You should ask Marienelle, she knows. Steven has always been confused about this.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Yes, Steven knows her,' Unknown_Marsantes replied, 'Steven admitted that Steven was wrong. But Steven has decided to stop seeing her. It seems she's a bad woman, and she doesn't hide it at all.'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"After all, the Stevenes were too trusting and too hospitable in the past. From now on, Steven will never have anything to do with people of this nation.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"The Stevenes don't keep in touch with their distant relatives from the provinces, but they open their doors to Jews. Now we'll see how they repay the Stevenes.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Ah! What can Steven possibly say? Steven has a very lovely son, yet he behaves like a madman, saying the most foolish things.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her, having heard Monsieur de Fairhaven allude to Peter, say another word. \"I heard her say, 'Really, speaking of Peter, haven't you seen him?' she asked Charles.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Today is Saturday, Steven thinks he will come to Willowbrook for twenty-four hours, he must have seen you already.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:09:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that in reality, Unknown_Marsantes believed her son wouldn't take leave, and she knew that Peter, even if he had leave, wouldn't come to visit Charles.\n[1898-10-11 11:09:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that she hoped to make her suspicious aunt forgive her son by pretending to believe she could see Peter here.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard \"Peter is here! He hasn't even written a single word to Steven.\" Steven thought, since returning from Riverside, he hadn't seen him at all.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard \"He's too busy, he has so much to do,\" Unknown_Marsantes said.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward's eyes following the circle drawn by the tip of the parasol on the carpet. I saw a barely perceptible smile cause Edward's eyelashes to flutter slightly.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:21] The living room of Villeparisis | I know that whenever Samuel clearly neglected his wife, Unknown_Marsantes always took his sister-in-law's side, harshly blaming her brother.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Edward, who always felt a mixture of gratitude and resentment whenever she recalled her protector; her attitude toward Peter's recklessness was half anger, half fondness.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw, just then, the door opened again, and Peter came in.\n[1898-10-11 11:10:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Look, speak of Peter and Peter appears,' \" Edward said.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Unknown_Marsantes with his back to the door and didn't see his son come in.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of how her motherly heart would be so delighted when she saw it.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:16] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her body slightly lean forward, her face trembling with a mixture of surprise and joy as she gazed at Peter. \"I heard, 'Why, you're here! That's delightful! I never expected it at all!'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:11:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the Belgian diplomat laugh heartily after speaking. I heard, \"Ah! Speaking of Peter, Peter has arrived. Steven understands.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:11:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I found it very interesting,\" I said. Edward replied coldly. I thought she didn't like using homophonic puns, and just now she must have said it as a form of self-mockery.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Hello, Peter,' she said, 'Hey! You've forgotten your aunt!\"\n[1898-10-11 11:11:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw them exchange a few words. When Peter was about to go greet her Robert, Edward turned toward Steven. I thought Steven must be talking about Steven.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard her say, \"Hello, how are you feeling?\" to Steven.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her cast a blue glance at Steven, hesitated for a moment, then extended her bent arm, leaning forward slightly.\n[1898-10-11 11:11:56] The living room of Villeparisis | I had just begun to bend over when I immediately pulled back, like a bush that has been pressed down and, once freed, instantly returns to its natural position.\n[1898-10-11 11:12:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw it like that, she performed the actions under Peter's fiery gaze, while Peter watched his aunt, trying hard to make her more enthusiastic.\n[1898-10-11 11:12:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that he was afraid the conversation wouldn't take off, so I added fuel to the fire and answered for Steven. I heard, \"He isn't in good health, he often feels tired. But if he could see you more often, he might get better. Because, Steven doesn't want to hide it from you, he really wants to see you.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:12:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Ah! Well, that's good,' \" Edward said deliberately in a flat tone. I thought it was as if Steven had brought her her coat.\n[1898-10-11 11:12:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard \"Steven is happy.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:12:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Peter say to Steven, \"Well, Steven is going to go to Steven's Robert's, so you sit in Steven's chair.\" And as he said this, he pulled Steven over to his aunt.",

I thought she seemed as if Steven hadn't seen her, and she was reporting a piece of news to Steven.\n[1898-10-11 11:12:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"It's very beneficial for the body.\"\n[1898-10-11 11:12:56] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Edward,' Unknown_Marsantes whispered, 'you said you were going to visit Madame de Saint-Lou, could you please tell her not to wait for Steven for dinner?'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:13:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'Since Peter has returned, Steven will have to stay home. If possible, please have someone go and buy a few boxes of Peter's favorite cigars, the Corona brand—there are none left at home.'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:13:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Peter coming over. He only heard the name of Madame de Saint-Florentin.\n[1898-10-11 11:13:16] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Madame de Peter? Who is she?' he asked in an astonished tone, demanding an answer. I thought that it was because he pretended to know nothing about society.\n[1898-10-11 11:13:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'What's the matter, dear, how could you not know?' he said to Robert, 'she's the sister of the Count de Véramont, isn't she? Isn't the billiard table you love so much a gift from her?'\"\n[1898-10-11 11:13:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Why, it's the sister of the Count de Vérimont! Steven never even considered that. Oh! The people in Steven's family are truly remarkable,\"\n[1898-10-11 11:13:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him turn his face halfway toward Steven, speaking inadvertently in Richard's manner. I thought the idea had come from Richard.\n[1898-10-11 11:13:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him stress the final consonant of every word. I heard him say, \"He knows nothing but strange and peculiar people, people named Saint-Fréo, who attend balls, ride in open carriages, and live like gods. It's really wonderful!\"\n[1898-10-11 11:13:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward's throat producing that same faint, short, and forceful sound, like a stifled laugh. I thought about how she was forced by family ties to respond to her nephew's humor.\n[1898-10-11 11:13:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the servant come in to announce that Prince von Weymarn-Faufenheim had sent word to Paul that he had arrived.\n[1898-10-11 11:13:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the former ambassador go out to greet the German chancellor. I heard \"Please ask him to come in, sir,\" said Charles to the former ambassador.\n[1898-10-11 11:14:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him, but Charles called him back. I heard, \"Please wait, sir, are you saying Steven should show the miniature portrait of Empress Charlotte to him?\"\n[1898-10-11 11:14:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the Major speaking with absolute certainty. \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven will be delighted to meet him.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:18:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, who felt he was envious of the favors the lucky prime minister would receive.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:06] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Ah! Steven knows his thoughts are orthodox,' Unknown_Marsantes said, 'which is rare among foreigners. But Steven heard he was the embodiment of anti-Semitism.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:18:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of how Steven found the first syllables of the German prince's name, if described in musical terms, to be bright and forceful, but when spoken according to their syllables, they gave a stammering, repetitive feeling.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven felt that within this brisk and repetitive rhythm, the name of the Prince retained a certain vigor, a pretentious simplicity, preserving the Germanic quality of being heavy yet light, strong yet soft.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of the pale green branches, like a projection on a \"house\" coated with deep blue enamel, revealing the mystery of a painted glass window behind the gilded decorations, which were elaborately carved in the style of eighteenth-century Germany but rather unremarkable.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that this name was composed of several elements, one of which was the name of a small German spa town where Steven and my David had gone as a child, located at the foot of a mountain where Goethe often took walks. Steven and my David drank wine made from grapes grown on the mountain in a sanatorium.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of the name of the wine, which was composed of a string of place names, sounding grand and pleasant, like the epithet Homer bestows upon his heroes.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, so when Steven heard someone announce the prince's name, he hadn't yet had time to associate it with the spa resort, and already the name seemed smaller, more human, as if it had been approved and designated, and thus entered Steven's memory.\n[1898-10-12 11:18:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I feel satisfied that it is free-spirited, ordinary, vivid, light-hearted, and amusing, and that it holds a place in Steven's memory.\n[1898-10-12 11:19:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw how Samuel, when introducing the prince, listed several of his titles in one breath. I thought of Steven, who had recognized the name of a village, a village through which a small river flowed. Every evening, after treatment, Steven would row his boat through swarms of mosquitoes to go play in the village.\n[1898-10-12 11:19:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, who had also recognized the name of a forest, very far away, which the doctor had forbidden Steven to visit for a walk.\n[1898-10-12 11:19:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that in reality, the lordship could extend out to the surrounding villages, and when Steven heard the list of the lord's titles, it was natural for him to connect the many villages that were adjacent on a map.\n[1898-10-12 11:19:16] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, beneath the visors of the Holy Roman Emperor's prince and the knight of the Frankish kingdom, there was a beloved land, and Steven seemed to see the sunlight at six o'clock in the evening often shining upon this land. At least, before the arrival of this prince, Steven saw only the last rays of the setting sun.\n[1898-10-12 11:19:21] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that Steven would soon find out, and the prince, using the income from the forest inhabited by the earth spirit and the river inhabited by the water spirit, had bought five Chiron cars and a house each in Willowbrook and London.\n[1898-10-12 11:19:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that he also had a box at the opera every Monday, and another box at the Comédie-Française every Tuesday.\n[1898-10-12 11:20:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven didn't believe—nor did he differ from others—that he was any different from those people who were his equals in wealth, his contemporaries in age, and whose families were less poetic than his. He shared the same culture and ideals as them, and he took pride in his status, but only because it was profitable.\n[1898-10-12 11:20:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that for the rest of his life, his only real desire was to become an associate member of the School of Ethics and Politics, and it was precisely because of this that he had come to visit Charles.\n[1898-10-12 11:20:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that the princess's wife led the most fashionable circle in Berlin, and it was only out of necessity that the prince had come to call on Charles today; he had not at all intended to do so at first.\n[1898-10-12 11:20:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that for many years he had been trying desperately to gain admission to the French Academy, and unfortunately, the number of professors who had ever intended to vote for him never exceeded five.",

Steven will be very happy!' Paul said with unwavering certainty. I knew that when the German knight said, \"Steven very much wants to be your colleague.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:22:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that someone as simple-minded as Professor Goedal would have said, \"Look, he's at Steven's place, it was his own idea to come here because he thinks Steven is more important than he is. He told Steven that he would be happy if Steven became a corresponding member. There's always some meaning to it, damn it!\"\n[1898-10-12 11:22:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"He didn't offer to vote for Steven because he couldn't think of it. He kept talking about how much power Steven had, probably assuming that Steven was already certain to win, having secured the necessary votes, so he didn't bring up the idea of voting for Steven.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:23:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"If Steven forced him to take a stand, if they reached an agreement between the two of them, if you just told him: then vote for Steven, he would have no choice but to vote.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:23:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew, however, that Prince Farnheim was no simple-minded man; Professor Goard might have called him a \"shrewd diplomat.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:23:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that the Prince of Germany knew Paul was also a shrewd diplomat, and would not fail to realize that casting a vote for the candidate would please the candidate.\n[1898-10-12 11:23:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that the prince had held many such meetings during his career as ambassador and foreign minister, for his country—not for himself, as he does now. I thought he had already guessed what the other person wanted and what the other person didn't want you to say.\n[1898-10-12 11:23:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that he knew that in diplomatic language, a meeting is an act of giving, so he managed to have Paul awarded the Order of Saint Andrew.\n[1898-10-12 11:23:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but if he had to report to his government about his meeting with Paul afterward, he might write in the cable: \"Steven has realized that Steven has taken the wrong path.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:24:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"You have made Steven very happy, and also happy for Steven's colleagues. Steven thought, if you are thinking of them, they will certainly feel deeply honored.\" I knew that when he once again mentioned the French Academy, Paul said it to him again.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that 'your candidacy is a remarkable thing, rather unusual. You know, the French Academy is very conservative; when something new appears, they become extremely defensive.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:24:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him force out a smile, his voice low, like a narrator's aside in a play meant to produce a certain effect. He quickly glanced at the prince with his blue eyes, as if an old actor assessing the impact of his performance. \"I heard that Steven personally disapproves of this. Steven has said so many times in front of his colleagues! Once, Steven even used the word 'conservative'—may God forgive Steven.\" He went on to say.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'You understand, Your Highness, Steven doesn't want you, such an outstanding person, to get involved in a gamble that is destined to fail. As long as Steven's colleagues hold on to their outdated ideas, Steven thinks you should be careful and not get involved in the election.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:24:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"In addition, please believe that if, one day, Steven discovers in this place becoming a cemetery a somewhat newer and more lively idea, or if Steven foresees your success, he will be the first to come and tell you.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:24:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"Steven was wrong, he shouldn't have been given the Order of St. Andrew,\" the prince mused, \"the negotiations have gotten nowhere, what he wants isn't that. Steven doesn't have the key to unlock it.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:24:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of this kind of reasoning, which Paul was also thoroughly familiar with and handled effortlessly, since he and the prince had both received their education at the same school.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought how Steven and others could mock the stuffy stupidity of an ambassador like Paul, and how they would be enchanted by a nearly meaningless official phrase.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought about it, but their immaturity was compensated for: diplomats knew that on the scale of ensuring balance in Europe or other regions, sincere feelings, eloquent speeches, and desperate pleas were insignificant.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that the real, weighty, decisive factor was not these things, but whether the other party had the possibility—(if the other party was stronger, then it was possible)—to satisfy one of Steven's desires through exchange.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that for this kind of matter, a person without any self-interest, like Steven's grandmother, would find it difficult to understand, yet Paul and Prince vonso-and-so often faced this very problem.\n[1898-10-12 11:24:56] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that Paul had served as a representative in several countries where relations with the Stevenes were extremely tense, and he was deeply worried about the developments.\n[1898-10-12 11:25:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about it, but he knew very well that no one would explicitly tell him whether to choose \"peace\" or \"war,\" but rather another seemingly ordinary word, which in reality was either terrifying or pleasing. The diplomat could immediately decipher it according to the code.\n[1898-10-12 11:25:21] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, in order to uphold France's dignity, he would respond with another very common word, which the minister of a hostile country would immediately interpret as \"war.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:25:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that in such cases, according to an old custom, the talks between the two sides, which were decided by fate to be either \"war\" or \"peace,\" usually did not take place in a minister's office, but on a bench in a sanatorium.\n[1898-10-12 11:25:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the minister and Paul go to the sanatorium's thermal springs, drinking the therapeutic mineral water from small cups.\n[1898-10-12 11:25:56] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that there seemed to be some kind of understanding between them, and they would meet during their treatment time, first taking a walk together for a while. I thought that both of us understood that this apparently calm walk had the seriousness of a mobilization order.\n[1898-10-12 11:26:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but even in this private matter of the election to the rank of Corresponding Member of the French Academy, the Prince of Germany employed the inductive method he had used in his diplomatic career, that is, the method of deciphering overlapping symbols.",

Some among them, lacking in intuition, would also be as clueless as Steven's grandmother about such schemes. However, Steven's grandmother didn't understand because she was honest and selfless.\n[1898-10-12 11:26:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of the men and women who were supported by others, how Steven often had to go into their hearts to understand what motives lay behind the things they said and did for self-interest and survival, even though on the surface they seemed beyond reproach.\n[1898-10-12 11:26:21] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of the man who doesn't know, if a woman who he supports says to him, \"Steven, let's not talk about money.\" If I were to express this in musical terms, it should be considered a \"rest\" in the score.\n[1898-10-12 11:26:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that if she later said, \"Steven is very sad because you don't often tell Steven the truth, and Steven can't stand it anymore,\" he would understand it as, \"Is there another man giving her more money?\"\n[1898-10-12 11:26:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, but Paul and the Prince of Germany, although unfamiliar with ruffians, were accustomed to taking the same stance as the state; the state, though great, was also a selfish and cunning thing, which could only be conquered by force and interest.\n[1898-10-12 11:26:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that for the sake of self-interest, a country could kill, and killing was often symbolic, because for a nation, a slight hesitation between fighting and not fighting could mean \"destruction.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:26:41] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that the following winter, the prince fell very ill. His illness was cured, but his heart was already beyond repair. I thought, \"What a terrible situation!\" He mused to himself, \"I need to act quickly. If I keep dragging my feet like this, I might not even live to become a corresponding member of the Academy, Steven.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:26:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him writing in the \"Deux Mondes\" magazine, discussing politics of the past twenty years, and he praised Paul with the most obsequious language on multiple occasions. I thought of the prince as if he were trying a different key in the lock, muttering to himself: \"Still not the right one.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:26:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I felt a little short of breath when I saw him see Paul off. I thought to myself: \"Damn it, these guys won't let Steven become an academician until he's dead. We have to act fast.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:26:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | That evening, I saw him meet Paul at the opera. \"I heard him say, 'Dear Ambassador,' to Paul, 'you told Steven this morning that you didn't know how to express your gratitude to Steven. Steven will dare to ask you to fulfill your promise.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:27:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him smiling, ready to listen attentively. I thought he immediately understood that Prince de Farnheim was not making him a request, but a suggestion.\n[1898-10-12 11:27:06] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Oh, you might think Steven is too forward. There are two women that Steven has always greatly admired: one is his wife, and the other is Madame Edward, of course in a completely different way, which you will understand in a moment.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:27:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"They recently settled in Willowbrook and plan to stay here forever. They want to hold a few dinners, especially to entertain the King and Queen of England. They've set their eyes on someone and want her to accompany the guests.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:27:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that, although they had never met her before, they greatly admired her. Steven admitted that he didn't know how to fulfill their wish, and he was completely at a loss. Then he heard that you knew this person. Steven knew that she was reclusive, only willing to associate with a few people. Ah! What a true 'happy few'!\"\n[1898-10-12 11:27:21] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'But if you're willing to help, Steven believes that with your influence, she will allow you to introduce Steven to her, so that Steven can convey the wishes of Edward and the Princess to her.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:27:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"She might even agree to have dinner at Steven's house with the Queen of England. Who knows, may be she'll come to Bourges and spend Easter with the Stevenes at the Edward estate of John.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:27:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard \"This is Charles.\" Steven admitted that if Steven had a chance to become a regular in her intellectual circle, Steven would feel immense satisfaction, and would not regret giving up the opportunity to run for the position of corresponding member of the French Academy.\n[1898-10-12 11:30:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that the prince, feeling the lock move, had finally found the key to unlock it, and could not help but feel elated.\n[1898-10-12 11:30:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Dear Prince, there's no need to give up your candidacy,' Paul replied, 'when it comes to connections with the French Academy, no one can match the salon you mentioned—it is truly a cradle for training academicians.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:30:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven will relay your request to Charles; she will certainly be pleased. As for visiting your home, she hardly ever leaves it, which might be more difficult. However, Steven can introduce you to her, and you can explain it yourself.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:30:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'You mustn't give up the campaign. Exactly two weeks from now, Steven is having lunch at the house of Le Roy-Belieu, and after that, he'll go with him to an important meeting. Without his support, the campaign won't have a chance of success.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:30:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that Steven had mentioned your name to him, and he certainly had heard of you. He seemed to have some objections. But since he needs Steven's group's support in the next election, Steven plans to talk to him again.\n[1898-10-12 11:30:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven will clearly tell Steven that if he runs for office, Steven will directly tell him that if he runs for office, Steven will ask his friends to all vote for him.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:30:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven reckons that if he can assist you, you'll be certain of success. On the day, come to Charles's house at six o'clock in the evening. Steven will introduce you, and Steven will report to you about his conversation that morning with Monsieur Lebrun-Bourrienne.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:30:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw it that way: Prince Fersen finally came to visit Charles. When he opened his mouth to speak, Steven was deeply disappointed.\n[1898-10-12 11:30:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, who had not realized that a nation could have more distinctive characteristics than an elite class.\n[1898-10-12 11:30:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I did not perceive the characteristics of the German nation as something Steven had imagined would softly brush past him, with Alphonsine's voice and Koppel's dancing speeches echoing in Steven's ears, but rather in French spoken with a German accent. I thought that Steven could still feel the poetic and picturesque characteristics of that nation.",

    "text": "[1898-10-12 11:31:01] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the prince from the Rhine region, round and red-faced, bow deeply to Charles. I heard him say, \"Hello, Charles.\" He spoke with the accent of an Alsatian doorman.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward say something to Steven, trying hard to appear kind and friendly, in an effort to make up for her coldness toward him earlier. \"I heard, 'Well, would you like a cup of tea, or may be some fruit pie, which is quite good.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:31:11] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard \"Steven, this is a case of offering flowers to someone else.\" She said it again, in a mocking tone. I saw that it gave her voice a slight huskiness, as if she were holding back a raspy laugh.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:16] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Sir,' Charles said to Paul, 'are you going to talk to the Prince about the French Academy issue later?'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:31:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Edward lower her head and turn her wrist to check the time. \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven's God, if Steven is thinking of stopping by the de Peter family again, he should say goodbye to his aunt Steven. Steven will have dinner at the Leurville family's.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:31:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her not saying goodbye to Steven, rising to her feet and leaving immediately because she had seen John coming in.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw John, who was very embarrassed to run into Steven here. I thought she might have remembered that she was the first to tell Steven that she was certain Unknown_Dreyfus was innocent.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:36] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I don't think Steven wants Steven's mother to introduce Steven to John,\" Peter said to Steven, \"she was once a prostitute. Her husband was Jewish, but she used to talk about nationalism in his ear all the time. Look, here comes Steven's uncle, M. de Charlus.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:31:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that a few days ago, an uninvited guest came to see Steven—Matthew-Morel. Steven didn't know him; he was the son of the personal servant of Steven's great-uncle. I thought of John's appearance, which had a special significance for Steven, and this was connected to an event that had happened a few days earlier.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew his valet had several times expressed a desire to come see Steven, but because he had to return to his hometown for treatment and would have to stay there for a long time, he sent his son instead to visit Steven.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw how Steven was stunned when he saw a handsome eighteen-year-old boy enter his house. I saw his attire was more sumptuous than elegant; he looked like everything except a servant.\n[1898-10-12 11:31:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him smiling proudly and confidently telling Steven that he had won first prize at the Conservatory of Music and Drama. I knew the purpose of his visit: his father had, while sorting through Steven's great-uncle Adolphe's belongings, set aside some items he considered unsuitable to send to Steven's mother, Robert.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew those photos of the actresses who had turned purple from excessive rouge and the notorious prostitutes, whom my great-uncle had known in his lifetime—they were a true reflection of the last days of a man devoted to pleasure.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw when little Morel handed the photo to Steven, that Steven noticed how he was pretending to be on equal footing with Steven in their conversation. I thought about how he liked to say \"you\" and tried to avoid saying \"sir,\" while his father, when speaking to Steven's parents, always used the third person.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I don't see a photograph of your great-uncle in your room,\" I heard him say to Steven.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven's blood rush to his face, and Steven stammered. I heard \"Steven thinks of Steven without his photograph.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:32:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'What! Your great-uncle loved you so much, and you don't even have a photo of him? Steven can take one from the many photos James has saved and send it to you. Steven hopes you'll hang it in the most prominent place.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:32:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I realized that Steven would soon figure out that Morel was an \"ambitious man,\" who thought he had some talent for composition and could set poetry to music.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:31] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him ask Steven whether he knew the poet who held an important position in the \"aristocratic\" society, and Steven told him a name. I know that Steven later learned that he had soon written a letter to the poet, telling him that he was a fervent admirer of his work, and that he had set one of his sonnets to music.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:36] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew he was being a bit too hasty, revealing his whole scheme, and the poet was hurt and ignored him.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him watching Mark's niece sewing a vest in the yard, and I said to Steven that hehappened to needed a \"unique\" vest. I thought, but Steven sensed it too; he said he wanted a sweater, but in reality he had taken a liking to the girl. Without hesitation, he asked Steven to go downstairs and introduce him.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:46] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard him say, 'But you mustn't talk about Steven's relationship with your family. You understand, about James, Steven believes you can keep a secret. Just say that Steven is a great artist known to your friends. You see, we should make a good impression on the businessman.'\" He instructed Steven.\n[1898-10-12 11:32:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that although he had instructed Steven to call him an artist, Steven avoided bestowing that title on him in the tailor's shop. I thought that Steven was merely answering his \"you\" with a \"you.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:32:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the girl and her two \"apprentices\" starting to work again. I thought that Steven had developed a liking for her and Matthew-Morel, and she believed that Matthew-Morel was \"a person of Steven's class\" (only more elegant and more refined), which filled her with admiration.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:01] The living room of Villeparisis | When I saw the photograph earlier in the room, Steven was surprised to discover that one of the photos his father had taken of him was actually a photograph of the portrait of Mlle. X, the girl from George, which was based on John's likeness.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that, when Steven escorted him to the main entrance where carriages came and went, Steven said to him. \"I heard 'Steven wants to ask you something, but Steven is afraid you might not know. Is Steven's great-uncle familiar with that woman? Steven can't imagine how she's connected to any part of Steven's great-uncle's life. Because of Mr. Matthew, Steven is very interested in this...\"\n[1898-10-12 11:33:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Look, Steven forgot to tell you, James instructed Steven to draw your attention to this woman. Because on the day you last saw your great-uncle, this notorious woman was having dinner at his house.'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:33:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'James didn't know whether to let you in. You seem to have pleased this prostitute, and she wants to see you again. But ever since then, according to James, there was a falling-out in your family, and after that you never saw your great-uncle again!'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:33:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | At that moment, I saw him sending a smile to Mark's niece from afar, saying goodbye to her. I thought of her watching him leave, probably admiring his thin but well-proportioned face, his carefree hair, and his cheerful eyes.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:26] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that, for Steven, when Steven shook hands with him and said goodbye, his mind was elsewhere, thinking of John. I thought to myself, Steven, in astonishment, that although in Steven's memory John and the \"woman in pink\" were two different people, from now on Steven would have to see them as one and the same.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw M. de Charlus sit down next to John as soon as he entered.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of how he disdained men and was very popular with women. At any gathering, he would quickly attach himself to the most elegant woman, and he felt their stylish, beautiful attire became his own ornament.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the baron dressed in a tight-fitting overcoat or tailcoat, looking like a successful portrait painted by a great artist who knew how to use color: he was wearing a black suit, but on the chair beside him lay a brightly colored overcoat, which he was about to put on for a costume party.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:46] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of him, hiding behind the fragrant barrier of the beautiful woman he had chosen to set up for him, separated from others, just as he would be in a theater box.\n[1898-10-12 11:33:51] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, of course, John wasn't necessarily the woman he liked to show off, but he still wanted people to know about his praise for her and his friendship with Matthew.",

He didn't care at all about damaging his reputation, and in fact, he might even feel that it raised his status to be seen with the most beautiful woman present.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:01] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Charles was not particularly pleased by the visit of M. de Charlus, although M. de Charlus, despite finding his aunt quite disagreeable, still loved her very much. I thought, but he often imagined some grievances and, in a fit of anger, would write her extremely brutal letters, bringing up trivial matters that he had never before noticed.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I know Steven could give an example, because Steven had heard while staying at Riverside that Charles wanted to stay longer on the beach and borrowed three thousand francs from M. de Charlus.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:11] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that a month later, Monsieur de Charlus had quarreled with his aunt over a small matter and asked her to wire him the loan, which he received in the amount of two thousand nine hundred and ninety-something francs.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:16] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I'm right, \" Charles answered, \"the telegraph fee will cost six francs and seventy-five centimes.\" I knew that a few days later, he met his aunt in Willowbrook, spoke to her affectionately, and gently pointed out to her that the bank responsible for sending the money had made a mistake.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:21] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw M. de Charlus happily conclude and then kiss my aunt's hand. I heard, \"No matter what, you are quite right to do so.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:34:26] The living room of Villeparisis | I know, but after some time, he wrote her a letter filled with extremely harsh and disrespectful words. \"Steven not only wants revenge,\" he wrote in a postscript, \"Steven also wants to humiliate you in public.\"\n[1898-10-12 11:34:31] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that the next day, instead of doing so, he went to apologize to his Aunt Verbalis, saying he shouldn't have written that terrible letter.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:36] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I know that before this, when he wasn't quarreling with his aunt, he would tell the story to everyone, without any malicious intent, just wanting to make people laugh. He told it to everyone he met, except for Charles, who remained completely in the dark.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:41] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that, when she learned from the letter that he would publicly declare what he had told her in person, that she had done everything correctly, thus ruining her reputation, she felt he had deceived her, that he had pretended to love her, but was actually lying. Although everything had calmed down, neither of them could fathom the other's true feelings toward themselves.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:46] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, despite everything, the Stevenes should remember that people's opinions of one another, the friendships between one person and another, and the family relationships among the Stevenes appear stable on the surface, but in reality are as changeable as the sea.\n[1898-10-12 11:34:51] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Steven's God, Steven's uncle is getting very close to John,' Peter said to Steven, 'but Steven's mother is completely unaware and is interrupting them. Pure people see everything as pure!'\"\n[1898-10-12 11:34:56] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven staring at M. de Charlus. I saw his tuft of white hair, his smiling eyes, and the eyebrows raised by his pince-nez, as well as the buttonhole with a red rose—these formed the three corners of a triangle, twitching and shifting, leaving a deep impression.\n[1898-10-12 11:35:06] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven not daring to greet him, because he had ignored Steven. I thought, but although he did not turn his face toward Steven, Steven was convinced that he had seen Steven.\n[1898-10-12 11:35:11] The living room of Villeparisis | When M. de Charlus talked to John, he looked around restlessly, like a street vendor calling out for customers but afraid the police might suddenly appear, scanning every corner of the room and not missing a single person. I saw John's vibrant butterfly-patterned coat fluttering occasionally on the baron's leg.\n[1898-10-13 11:36:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Monsieur de Charlérot approach him to greet him. I saw it, but there was no sign on his face that he had already noticed the young Samuel.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that there were many such gatherings, and M. de Charlus was always like this, wearing a smile that had no fixed direction or clear purpose. I thought that before people approached him to greet him, he was already smiling, but when you got close to him, his smile lost all its friendly meaning.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Steven had to go and greet John. I thought about it, but she didn't know that Steven knew the Unknown_Marsantes and Monsieur de Charlus, so she treated Steven coldly, perhaps fearing that Steven would ask her to introduce them.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that Steven went toward M. de Charlus, but immediately regretted it. I thought that although he had seen Steven, he was pretending not to.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:20] The living room of Villeparisis | When I saw Steven bowing to him, he extended an arm to keep Steven from coming close, as if he wanted Steven to kiss one of his fingers that was not ringed, just as a bishop would have someone kiss his sacred ring. I thought that, and it seemed as though he were deliberately trying to shift the blame onto Steven, making Steven force open the locks of his house and catch a glimpse of the smile that was always on his face, aimless and without a fixed direction or clear purpose.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:25] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that John had noticed the baron's coldness toward Steven, and so I too continued to be cold toward Steven.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'You seem very tired, as if you're troubled in your heart,' \" Unknown_Marsantes said to her son. I knew Peter had come to greet M. de Charlus.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw clearly that Peter's gaze seemed to often catch a glimpse of an abyss, but he would immediately withdraw as soon as he touched it, like a diver who touches the bottom of the pool and immediately returns to the surface. I thought of that bottom of the pool, where Peter's affair had broken down. The moment he thought of it, his heart felt as if cut by a knife, and he immediately stopped thinking about it, but soon after, he would think of it again.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:45] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her gently stroking his cheek. I heard her say, \"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all, I'm more than satisfied just to see my beloved child Steven.\" She Robert said again.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw it, but Unknown_Marsantes pulled him into the drawing room. I thought that she felt this caress seemed to annoy Peter.\n[1898-10-13 11:37:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw there, at a window draped with yellow silk curtains, several Bovee armchairs covered with thick violet brocade, like a few purple butterflies resting in a field of bright buttercups.\n[1898-10-13 11:38:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw John signal Steven to come to her. I thought about how she was alone, and at the same time realized that Steven's relationship with Peter was anything but ordinary.\n[1898-10-13 11:38:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven had not seen her for a long time, and I didn't know what to say to her.",

    "text": "[1898-10-13 11:38:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw several hats lying on the carpet. Steven's eyes never left his own hat, but inside he was curiously wondering. I thought there was a hat with a G written on it, and a picture of Samuel's coronet, but it was clearly not the Samuel of the Fairhaven family. Whose could it be?\n[1898-10-13 11:38:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought Steven knew the names of all the guests present, but he couldn't find a single person who could be the owner of this hat.\n[1898-10-13 11:38:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven point to Paul and say something to John. I heard \"Paul is wonderful. Of course, Peter told Steven that he was a plague, but...\"\n[1898-10-13 11:38:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'He's quite right.'\" She replied.\n[1898-10-13 11:38:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Steven realized she was remembering something she had always kept hidden from him, and Steven questioned her repeatedly.\n[1898-10-13 11:38:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her pull Steven into a corner. I suppose it was because she had almost no one in that salon, and she was glad to have someone talk to her.\n[1898-10-13 11:38:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I know what Peter wants to tell you, \" she answered Steven, \"but please don't tell him, he'll be angry with Steven for talking, and Steven really wants his respect. Steven is a very 'proper' woman, you know.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:38:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Recently, Charlus had dinner at the Prince de Fairhaven' house, and Steven doesn't know how people are talking about you.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:39:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"Paul probably told them—this is nonsense, don't worry about it, no one took his words seriously, everyone knows a dog can't spit out ivory—calling you a flatterer, a madman.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:39:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, who would be stunned to hear this. Now, Steven had also learned that his earlier infatuation with John and her daughter Michael, which he had discussed with M. Paul, had reached the ears of the Countess de Fairhaven, whom Steven considered a stranger. This made Steven even more astonished.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven's words and attitudes, which were separated from the \"world\" by an environment that was infinitely penetrating and inscrutable to Steven himself, an environment that those who did not directly sense Steven's words and attitudes could not grasp.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of how all Stevenes have had this personal experience: some important words, although Stevenes long for them to be widely known (for example, about John, Steven said many flattering things, and he would tell everyone, without regard to occasion, thinking that by spreading so many good seeds, at least one would take root and grow into a plant), are soon suppressed, and often it is precisely the wish of the Stevenes themselves.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:20] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that, therefore, Steven would find it even harder to believe that an insignificant remark, one that even Steven himself had long forgotten, a phrase that they had never actually said but only partially reflected by another statement, could spread from mouth to mouth, all the way to distant places, even reaching the ears of the Princess de Fairhaven, becoming a joke that the gods would laugh at during their banquet!\n[1898-10-13 11:39:25] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of the things that Steven and his friends had done, which even their neighbors didn't know about; and the words that Steven and his friends had never said, indeed had never even spoken, would cause a riotous laugh in another world!\n[1898-10-13 11:39:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought about how the impressions others had of Steven's manner of speaking and behaving differed so greatly from Steven's own view of himself, and it occurred to me that it was even less like a real painting than a badly printed transfer print, which was neither properly white nor properly black.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:35] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself that the lines not printed were probably non-existent, yet what the Stevenes longed to see was actually something else. On the contrary, what the Stevenes considered superfluous was precisely their true face, but since it was right under their noses, they couldn't see it.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that, although this printed picture had become unrecognizable in the eyes of the Stevenes, it sometimes possessed the authenticity of an X-ray, though depressing, yet deep and useful, and this was not enough for the Stevenes to recognize that the picture depicted themselves.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:45] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of someone who is used to admiring his handsome face and elegant figure in the mirror; if you showed him his X-ray and told him that these few ribs were his image, he would doubt that there had been a mistake. It would be like someone visiting an art exhibition, standing before a portrait of a young woman, and then reading on the label: \"A camel lying down,\" and feeling puzzled.\n[1898-10-13 11:39:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that a few years ago, Steven would have happily told John, \"Why\" Steven was so kind to Paul, because meeting John had been Steven's \"heart's desire.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:39:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that now things had changed, and Steven no longer loved Michael, besides, Steven had never really been able to reconcile John with the woman in the pink dress he had seen as a child.\n[1898-10-13 11:40:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that, so Steven began talking to her about the woman who was currently occupying his mind. I heard Steven ask John, \"Did you see Edward de Fairhaven just now?\"\n[1898-10-13 11:40:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw her, but because Edward didn't greet her, she pretended to regard Edward as a completely uninteresting and unremarkable person.\n[1898-10-13 11:40:10] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her answer, and she used an English word, her expression one that made me feel uncomfortable. I heard, \"Steven doesn't know, Steven didn't see it.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:40:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven tactlessly inquiring about Madame Leroi with Charles. I thought about this very moment, in order to correctly imagine Edward's life.\n[1898-10-13 11:40:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I know, Steven knows,\" she said, pretending to be scornful, \"she's the daughter of those silly lumber merchants. Steven knows she's been seeing a lot of people lately.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:40:25] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'but Steven can tell you, Steven is old now and doesn't want to make new friends. Among the people Steven used to know, there were many who were interesting and lovely, so Steven really thinks Madame Leurval won't add anything new to Steven's life.'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:40:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Unknown_Marsantes become the companion of Charles, introducing Steven to Prince Fafnir.\n[1898-10-13 11:40:40] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that she hadn't finished speaking, and Paul was already enthusiastically introducing Steven, with very warm words.\n[1898-10-13 11:40:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought he probably believed that since someone had introduced Steven to him, it would be only polite to make a gesture of courtesy toward Steven, which would in no way harm his reputation.\n[1898-10-13 11:40:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, or he thought, that a foreigner, even a celebrity, couldn't possibly be familiar with French salons, and so he would think that he had introduced him to a young man from the upper class.",

I thought that Charles should let Paul tell Steven herself that she didn't regret not knowing Madame Lefevre.\n[1898-10-13 11:41:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Paul, you say Madame Lefevre has no charm at all? Is she less interesting than anyone who has come to Steven? Was it entirely correct not to bring her?\"\n[1898-10-13 11:41:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul return the greeting with respectful courtesy, but it was impossible to tell whether he approved or disapproved. I thought it might be an attempt to show independence, or perhaps because I was tired.\n[1898-10-13 11:41:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles smiling as he spoke to him. I heard him say, \"Sir, some people are absolutely ridiculous. Do you believe it? Today a man came to see Steven, and he insisted that kissing Steven's hand was more interesting than kissing a young woman's.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:41:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I recognized Thomas at once, and Paul squinted and smiled. I thought that wanting to kiss her hand seemed like a natural impulse, and one should not blame the person who had such an impulse. One could say it was the opening of a novel, and he intended to use the tolerance of Foyers or the young Crébillon toward decadence to excuse, even encourage, this opening.\n[1898-10-13 11:41:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the prince pointing to the unfinished watercolor of Charles and saying. I heard, \"A young woman's hand could not have painted the pictures Steven saw here.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:41:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him ask her if she had seen the floral paintings by Fontaine-Labard. I knew that his exhibition had just been held here.\n[1898-10-13 11:41:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Paul expressed his opinion. I heard, \"Those paintings are first-rate, as people now say, they come from a master, a skilled painter,\"\n[1898-10-13 11:41:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"But Steven thinks they can't compare to the paintings in Charles; her flowers are more colorful.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:41:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that even if the Stevenes could suppose that the former ambassador's words were prompted by the favoritism of an old lover, his habit of flattery, and the consensus within his circle, they could still see how lacking in taste the artistic appreciation of society people was.\n[1898-10-13 11:42:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought about how arbitrary their opinions were, how a trivial work could lead them to make ridiculous judgments, and how they would never have any genuine feelings to make them change their minds in the middle.\n[1898-10-13 11:42:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles modestly saying. I heard, \"Steven doesn't know flowers, Steven has always lived in the country.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:42:10] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her again speak kindly to the prince. I heard, \"However, if Steven knew a bit more about flowers than other country boys from the start, it was certainly due to an outstanding man from your country, Monsieur de Schweller.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:42:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that Steven met him in Blois, where Steven's Aunt Goldy, the wife of Marshal de Casteran, took Steven. Steven clearly remembered that Messrs. Lebrun, de Saffred and Doutant often asked him to talk about flowers.\n[1898-10-13 11:42:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard that at the time Steven was very young, and the Steven he spoke about couldn't have understood everything. But he always loved taking Steven out to play. After he returned home, he sent Steven a beautiful collection of plant specimens as a memory of the long ride they had taken together in a four-wheeled open carriage to the Léry Valley.\n[1898-10-13 11:42:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'That time, Steven fell asleep on his lap. Steven has always kept this collection of specimens, otherwise he might have failed to notice the characteristics of the flowers.'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:42:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard that when Madame de Boulanger published several letters from Madame Blouet (beautifully written, but affected, like their owner), Steven hoped to find in them some of M. de Schléger's conversations about flowers. But this woman only sought arguments for religion in nature.\n[1898-10-13 11:42:35] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Peter call Steven into the living room, where he and his Robert were.\n[1898-10-13 11:42:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'You're really nice today,' \" Steven said to him, \"How should I thank you? Can Steven and I have dinner together tomorrow?\"\n[1898-10-13 11:42:50] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'If you're willing, then tomorrow, but Richard has to come too. Steven ran into him at the door. At first he was cold towards Steven because he'd written him two letters, and Steven had accidentally forgotten to reply (he didn't tell Steven it was because of that, but Steven knew all along).'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:42:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | But then he was so affectionate toward Steven, and Steven couldn't betray such a friend. Steven felt that, between Steven and his friends, at least for himself, they were friends who would share life and death.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven didn't believe Peter had completely misjudged him, and that Richard often spoke bitterly because he felt his great enthusiasm was not being properly rewarded.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought how little he imagined others' lives, how he couldn't imagine that someone might be ill, or away on a trip, or occupied with something else, and so if he didn't receive a reply within a week, he would think that person was deliberately ignoring him.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:10] The parlor of Villeparisis | I thought that, therefore, Steven's extreme harshness as a friend, and later as a writer, was deeply rooted.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:15] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that if I showed him cold indifference or bowed to him servilely, he would only become more brutal and disrespectful in return. On the contrary, if I was warm and friendly toward him, he often softened.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:20] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard you say that Steven was kind to you,\" Peter continued, \"you're too kind, really. It's not that Steven was kind. Aunt Léa said that you were avoiding her, not even saying a word to her. She wondered what you had against her.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:43:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought it was a fortunate thing for Steven that, even if Steven believed these words to be true, he wouldn't have time to see Edward again, since he was about to leave for Riverside (and Steven thought the departure was imminent).\n[1898-10-13 11:43:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that it would be impossible to explain to her that Steven had no complaints about her, thus forcing her to admit that it was actually she who was discontented with Steven.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, but Steven, as soon as he thought about her, even though she hadn't let Steven go to her house to see George's paintings, became lucid.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, after all, it wasn't really disappointment, because Steven had never really hoped for anything, and Steven knew that she didn't like him, and to expect her to love Steven was pure fantasy.",

Steven wanted to take this impression completely to the beach, so that it would remain forever in his heart, rather than carry away a memory filled with worry and sorrow.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | When I saw Unknown_Marsantes talking to Peter, he often stopped to speak with Steven. I thought about how devoted she was to Steven, which made Steven feel very uneasy, because Steven believed that her devotion was driven by a fear—fear that she might end up quarreling with her son over Steven's sake.\n[1898-10-13 11:43:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought about how she hadn't seen her son all day and was eager to be alone with him. She believed her influence over him could not compare to Steven's, and so she should be more careful.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw and then she asked Steven whether this Bernard had ever lived in Nice. I knew that before this, Unknown_Marsantes had heard Steven asking Richard about his uncle Nascimento Bernard.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:10] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard her say, 'So he had already met him before Steven married Monsieur de Mantes,' and she added, 'Steven's husband often spoke about him, saying he was kind, honest, and generous.'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:44:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, \"It's hard to believe he can sometimes tell the truth.\" Richard might have thought something like that.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven have more leisure to observe Peter. I saw it, and only then did Steven realize that anger seemed to surge again from his chest, appearing on his stern and gloomy face.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:30] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, and how he would feel ashamed to face him, remembering the quarrel in the afternoon, remembering how he had shown no resistance to his mistress's cruelty, but had instead swallowed his anger.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him suddenly break free from the arm that Robert had around his neck, go over to Steven, pull Steven behind the small table covered with flowers where Charles was sitting, and signal to Steven to follow him into the little drawing room.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:45] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven rushing toward the small living room, but apparently Monsieur de Charlus thought Steven was leaving. He suddenly abandoned his conversation with Monsieur de Fauvres and swiftly turned around, coming face to face with Steven.\n[1898-10-13 11:44:55] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven, bewildered, realize he was holding a hat with the letters G and the Samuel crest inside.\n[1898-10-13 11:45:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him, without looking at Steven, saying something in the doorway of the small living room. I heard, \"Since Steven has seen that you have now entered society, Steven would like you to visit him. But it's quite complicated.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him speaking absentmindedly again, as if calculating some pleasant scheme in his mind, afraid that if he missed the chance to plan and carry it out with Steven, it would never happen again.\n[1898-10-13 11:45:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven doesn't spend much time at home; you'll have to write to Steven first. Oh, Steven would like a quieter place to talk with you in detail. Steven is leaving right away. Would you like to take a walk with Steven? It'll only take a little of your time.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:15] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I think you'd better be careful, sir,\" Steven said to him, \"you've taken a customer's hat.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:20] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Do you want to prevent Steven from taking his own hat?\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven had guessed someone had stolen his hat, and he didn't want to go home bareheaded, so he had just taken another one. If Steven found him out, he would be mortified. Not long ago, Steven had done a similar foolish thing.\n[1898-10-13 11:45:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that, so Steven no longer insisted. Steven said to him that Steven first wanted to say a few words to Peter. I heard, \"He's talking to that idiot Samuel from Fairhaven.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:35] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"That's an interesting remark. Steven will surely pass it along to the Steven brothers.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:40] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'Ah! Do you think this would interest Monsieur de Charlus?'\" I thought (Steven thought, if he had a brother, that brother should also be named Charlus. This question had been explained to Steven by Peter in Riverside, but Steven had momentarily forgotten.)\n[1898-10-13 11:45:45] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw the Baron speaking to Steven with arrogance. I heard, \"Who told you it was Monsieur de Charlus? Go to Peter. Steven knows, you were there when he was drinking and dining with the woman who ruined his reputation today.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"You should make good use of your influence over him, and teach him that he has disgraced the Steven family's reputation, causing worry to his poor Robert and the rest of the Stevenes.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:45:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I wanted to tell Steven that at that disgraceful lunch, the Stevenes had talked only about Emerson, Ibsen, and Tolstoy, and the girl advised Peter to drink only water and not wine.\n[1898-10-13 11:46:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought about how Steven believed Peter's pride had been hurt, and in an effort to comfort him as much as possible, Steven tried to understand his mistress.\n[1898-10-13 11:46:05] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven didn't know, but at that moment, although he was still angry with her, he was actually blaming himself.\n[1898-10-13 11:46:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that even if a good man and a good woman quarrel, with justice entirely on the side of the good man, there will always be some small matter that makes the bad woman seem, on some issue, not entirely wrong.\n[1898-10-13 11:46:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that because she was indifferent to other issues, as long as that good man still needed her, as long as he became depressed at the thought of breaking up with her, he would become cautious out of sadness, would keep remembering her ridiculous accusations against him, and would wonder if her accusations might actually be right.\n[1898-10-13 11:46:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that Steven thinks Steven wronged her over the necklace,\" Peter said to Steven, \"of course, Steven didn't mean any harm, but Steven knows that other people's opinions are different from Steven's. She suffered a lot when she was a child.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard her say, \"In her eyes, Steven was ultimately a rich man who believed in the power of money. Whether it was influencing Boulanger or fighting a lawsuit, the poor could never match the rich. Of course, she was too unkind to Steven; he had only ever wanted her to be happy.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:30] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'But, Steven knows, she thinks that Steven wants to make her feel that he can hold her with money, but that's not true. How much she loves Steven, I don't know what she must think of Steven! Poor girl! You know, how tender she is, Steven can't possibly descri be it to you—how many admirable things she has done for Steven.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:35] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard myself say, \"She must be suffering terribly right now! No matter what happens, Steven doesn't want her to think of him as unrefined. Steven is going to Bušlōn to buy that necklace. Who knows? May be seeing Steven do this, she'll admit she was wrong.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:40] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'You saw, Steven can't stand the thought of her being in pain. Other people's suffering, Steven knows about, but it doesn't affect Steven. But she's different. The thought of her being in pain, yet not being able to imagine what that pain looks like, is driving Steven completely mad.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:45] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard him say, \"Steven would rather never see her again than make her suffer. I wish her happiness; if necessary, Steven could leave her, that's all he asks. Listen, you know, for Steven, anything related to her is a matter of the greatest importance.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard that Steven had to go to the jewelry store right away, and then ask her for forgiveness. What would she think of Steven before he went to her house? If only she knew that Steven was going to see her! You could go to her house and try your luck. Who knows, may be everything will be fine.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:46:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him smile slightly, as if it were a beautiful dream, something he could hardly believe. \"I heard 'Perhaps Steven and the other two could go to the country for dinner. But it's still hard to say. Steven knows that Steven doesn't understand her at all. Poor dear, perhaps Steven will hurt her heart again. Besides, she may have already made up her mind and won't change it anymore.'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:47:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Peter suddenly pull Steven toward his Robert.",

I don't know when he'll be back; he probably won't have any time off within a month. As soon as Steven has news, he'll write and tell you.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:47:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought, of course, that Peter was certainly not the sort of son who, when attending social events with Robert, considered being rude to Robert a way to compensate for his smiles and greetings toward others; it seemed as though he believed that being rough with family members would make his suit look even better.\n[1898-10-13 11:47:20] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought Peter wasn't the type of man to behave this way, but because Brian wasn't with him, he was restless and uneasy. Although the circumstances were different, his cruelty toward Robert was even worse than that of those sons.\n[1898-10-13 11:47:25] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw him finish speaking, and Steven noticed Unknown_Marsantes tremble slightly, like a bird spreading its wings, and immediately stood up, just as she had reacted when she saw her son enter the room. I saw, but now it was a worried face, with eyes full of sorrow, gazing at his son.\n[1898-10-13 11:47:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'What, Peter, are you leaving? You're joking, aren't you? Dear child, you've only been with Steven for a day!' \"\n[1898-10-13 11:47:40] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that she then spoke again, in a soft voice, with the most natural tone. I heard, \"You know how unreasonable you're being!\"\n[1898-10-13 11:47:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of it as if quoting a reasonable argument, trying to keep my voice from showing sorrow, afraid of arousing my son's sympathy, which for him was painful or useless, only serving to annoy him.\n[1898-10-13 11:47:50] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw that, when she quoted this simple argument, she deliberately acted timid and shrinking in order to show her son that she didn't want to infringe on his freedom.\n[1898-10-13 11:47:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw it, and also to prevent my son from blaming her for interfering with his entertainment, she deliberately showed an infinite tenderness. I thought, but Peter felt himself about to feel compassion for Robert, and might even abandon the idea of having dinner with his mistress, which made him furious.\n[1898-10-13 11:48:00] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard, 'It's regrettable, but whether it's reasonable or not, that's just how it is.'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:48:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that perhaps he felt these words should have been directed at himself, yet he used them against Robert; selfish people always win arguments in this way. They first convince themselves that their resolve is unshakable, and the more someone moves their heart, the more they feel they are blameless, as if they were being forced by the other person to struggle against sympathy.\n[1898-10-13 11:48:10] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that, therefore, they could be cruel and unreasonable, and in their eyes, this would only make the other person more guilty.\n[1898-10-13 11:48:15] The drawing room of Villeparisis | Who made them so tactless, forcing them to show pain, to appear reasonable, to make them struggle painfully between sympathy and suffering!\n[1898-10-13 11:48:20] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Unknown_Marsantes no longer insisted. I thought that because she knew, even if she wanted to stay, it was already impossible to hold on.\n[1898-10-13 11:48:25] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Steven has left,' he said to Steven, 'but, Robert, don't keep him too long, because he's about to see someone.'\"\n[1898-10-13 11:48:30] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that Steven believed his presence would bring no joy to the Unknown_Marsantes, yet Steven preferred not to go with his son, fearing that she might think Steven was having fun with Peter and thus preventing Peter from staying by her side.\n[1898-10-13 11:48:35] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought Steven had intended to make a few excuses for his son's behavior, not because he cared for the son, but out of sympathy for her.\n[1898-10-13 11:48:40] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw, but she spoke first. \"I heard her say, 'Poor child,' to Steven, 'Steven must have made him unhappy. You see, gentlemen, mothers are all selfish. He has so little entertainment, and it's not easy for him to come to Willowbrook.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:48:45] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'Steven's God, if he hasn't left yet, Steven would really like to go after him, of course not to try to stop him, but to tell him that Steven doesn't hold any resentment, that Steven thinks he did the right thing. Steven is going to the staircase to check, won't that be troublesome for you?\"\n[1898-10-13 11:48:50] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Steven and the others arrived at the staircase. I heard her shout, \"Peter? Peter!\" \"We can't catch him, he's gone, it's too late.\"\n[1898-10-13 11:48:55] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that if it had been a few hours earlier, Steven might have sincerely advised Peter to go live with his mistress. But now, Steven might even take the initiative to act as an intermediary, urging him to cut all ties with her.\n[1898-10-13 11:49:00] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that in the first case, the people from Peter's family would call Steven a fellow drunkard, and in the second, Peter would call Steven a traitor, yet Steven remained Steven, with only a few hours separating the two.\n[1898-10-13 11:49:05] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw the Stevenes return to the living room. When Steven saw that Charles had not returned with Peter, he exchanged a glance with Paul. I thought that Steven would look at it with an expression of confusion, mockery, and lack of sympathy; when the Stevenes pointed out a wife who was too jealous and made a fool of herself in public, or a Robert who was too gentle and thus became the subject of laughter, they would exchange such a glance, as if saying, \"Look, there's probably been a row.\"\n[1898-10-14 12:07:12] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Peter had gone to his mistress's house with that brilliant and dazzling necklace, but according to their agreement, he shouldn't have given it to her.\n[1898-10-14 12:07:32] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that in any case the result would be the same, because she didn't want it, and even later she never accepted it.\n[1898-10-14 12:07:52] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew Peter's friends thought that her refusal of the necklace seemed selfless, yet she had ulterior motives, wanting to keep him firmly bound to her.\n[1898-10-14 12:08:12] The living room of Villeparisis | I knew that, but she didn't like money unless it could be spent in a single gesture of extravagance. I thought of Steven, who had seen her generously, almost as if she had lost her mind, giving to those she considered poor.\n[1898-10-14 12:08:17] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"At this moment, she might be having fun at the Shepherdess Amusement Park. Brian is a mystery, a real Sphinx.\" I knew that Peter's friends had told Peter such things in order to counteract Brian's selfless behavior with slander.\n[1898-10-14 12:08:22] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself, in reality, how many women, supported by men, are greedy and ambitious, skilled at calculating in such a life, generously taking advantage of their lovers, making them pay for one expense after another?\n[1898-10-14 12:08:27] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Peter was almost completely unaware of his mistress's infidelities. He racked his brain trying to imagine Brian's life, but it always revolved around trivial little things, and he could never grasp the real life that began the moment he left her.\n[1898-10-14 12:08:32] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought that people could tell him all about it, but they couldn't shake his confidence in Brian, because not knowing the actions of one's beloved is a charming natural law that reveals itself most clearly in the most complex societies.\n[1898-10-14 12:08:37] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought to myself, on this side of the glass wall: \"She's an angel, she'll never give herself to Steven. Steven can only die, but she loves Steven; she loves Steven so deeply, perhaps... no, that's impossible!\"\n[1898-10-14 12:08:42] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought that when he lost control of his desires, or when he became so restless from waiting, he would place all sorts of jewelry at the feet of this woman, and go to borrow money to dispel her sorrow!\n[1898-10-14 12:08:47] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought, but the audience on the other side of the glass wall said, \"You don't know her? Then Steven should congratulate you. She's stolen from and ruined countless men! She's a complete fraud, a schemer!\"\n[1898-10-14 12:08:52] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought this last qualification might not be entirely without reason, because even a man who did not truly love the woman but was merely interested in her and given to suspicion would say to his friend, \"No, dear, she's certainly not that kind of prostitute. Steven said she isn't frivolous at all in life, but she's not a woman you can buy, unless you pay a lot—either fifty thousand francs or nothing at all.\"",

I thought that, therefore, the most shameless and infamous people in the world are always recognized by someone as rare and exquisite treasures, delightful and remarkable.\n[1898-10-14 18:02:12] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Unknown_Marsantes whisper something to Steven. I heard him say, \"Steven only blames himself for one thing—Steven shouldn't have said he was unreasonable. He was Steven's beloved son, his only son, because Steven had no other sons, and they hadn't seen each other in a long time. To call him unreasonable, Steven would have preferred that he had just hit Steven with a stick, because Steven was certain that whatever he did tonight would be ruined by this unfair remark.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:02:17] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Unknown_Marsantes change her attitude again, becoming once more a lady of fashion. I heard, \"Oh, sir, since you're in such a hurry, Steven won't keep you. It's so pleasant, so delightful for Steven to speak with you. Thank you! Thank you!\"\n[1898-10-14 18:02:22] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw her looking at Steven with a respectful and happy gaze, as if speaking to Steven was the greatest joy of her life. I saw Steven noticing how the enchanting gaze and the black flowers on the white floral-patterned dress complemented each other, a gaze belonging to an experienced lady.\n[1898-10-14 18:02:27] The living room of Villeparisis | I heard, \"Steven can't leave yet; Steven has to wait for Monsieur de Charlus.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:02:32] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles hear the last few words and his expression turned unpleasant. I thought that if this matter were not in any way connected with shame, Steven would have taken the unease appearing on Charles's face as a sign of conscience. But Steven never even considered such a possibility.\n[1898-10-14 18:02:37] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Steven was very pleased with Edward, with Peter, Unknown_Marsantes, and M. de Charlus, and with Charles, so Steven began to talk nonsense, his eyes sparkling with excitement.\n[1898-10-14 18:02:42] The drawing room of Villeparisis | \"I hear you're going with Monsieur de Charlus, Steven's nephew?\" she asked Steven.\n[1898-10-14 18:02:47] The living room of Villeparisis | \"I heard 'it's him who wants Steven to go back with him,' \" Steven answered with great self-satisfaction, \"Steven is very happy. Besides, Madame, the friendship between Steven and him is much deeper than you can imagine, and Steven is determined to do everything possible to strengthen Steven's friendship.\" I thought to myself that Steven, by maintaining a relationship with a nephew she admired, would certainly make a good impression on her.\n[1898-10-14 18:02:52] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw Charles seem to shift from displeasure to concern. \"I don't want to wait for him,\" she said uneasily to Steven, \"he's talking with de Faverne. He's already forgotten what he said to you just now. Well, you'd better go, quickly, while his back is turned.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:02:57] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw that Steven wasn't particularly eager to go find Peter and his mistress, but Charles seemed determined for Steven to leave, so Steven said goodbye to her. I thought to myself that Steven might have something important to say to his nephew.\n[1898-10-14 18:03:02] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I saw Samuel sitting heavily beside her, proud and dignified, like a god on Mount Olympus.\n[1898-10-14 18:03:07] The living room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven, feeling his wealth filling his limbs, as if it had melted in a crucible into a golden ingot shaped like a human, giving this wealthy man an extraordinary density.\n[1898-10-14 18:03:12] The living room of Villeparisis | I saw him rise politely from his seat when Steven said goodbye to him. I thought of Steven, feeling his lazy body, packed with thirty million francs, standing before him, and it was the old French education that prompted him to move.\n[1898-10-14 18:03:17] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I thought of Steven as if he had seen the Zeus of Olympia, said to have been sculpted in pure gold by Phidias.\n[1898-10-14 18:03:22] The drawing room of Villeparisis | I knew that Samuel would laugh heartily at his own witty remarks, but he never showed the slightest smile at someone else's humor. I thought this must be the power of the Jesuit education over Samuel, at least over Samuel's body, for it had no control over his mind.\n[1898-10-14 18:03:27] The staircase of the Villeparisis mansion | I saw that on the stairs, Steven heard a voice calling out \"Steven\" behind him. I heard the voice of M. de Charlus saying, \"Sir, why didn't you wait for Steven?\"\n[1898-10-14 18:03:32] The courtyard of the house in Villeparisis | I saw that when the Stevenes arrived in the courtyard, he coldly said to Steven. I heard, \"It's not a problem for you to walk a few steps, is it? All the way until Steven finds a suitable horse carriage.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:03:37] Paris Street | I heard, \"You have something to say to Steven, sir?\"\n[1898-10-14 18:03:42] Paris Street | \"I heard, 'Ah! Well, yes, Steven has something to say to you, though he's not sure whether to say it or not. Naturally, Steven thinks the thing he wants to tell you will bring you immeasurable benefits.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:03:47] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"But Steven also had a feeling that this would waste a lot of Steven's time, would disrupt Steven's routine, and Steven was already at an age where he longed for a quiet life. Yet Steven was thinking to himself, whether you were worth Steven's concern. However, Steven didn't want to wait until he knew you well enough before making a decision.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:03:52] Paris Street | I heard, \"When Steven was in Riverside, he found you unremarkable, even taking into account the man himself and that silly look he always had in those rope-soled sneakers.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:03:57] Location: Paris Street | I saw him force himself to repeat the words, one by one, with great effort. I heard: \"Besides, you probably don't really want Steven to do it for you, so Steven doesn't need to trouble himself. After all, sir, forgive me for saying so, but it would only cause Steven trouble.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:04:02] Location: Paris Street | I saw Steven clearly indicate that, since that was the case, there was no need to trouble himself. I thought that the conversation ended like this seemed unsatisfactory to him.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:07] Paris Street | I saw him speaking to Steven in a severe tone. I heard him say, \"What's the point in being so polite? Nothing is more pleasant than worrying about someone worth worrying about.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:04:12] Paris Street | I heard that for the outstanding members of the Steven group, studying art, loving antiquities, collecting rare items, and enjoying gardening were all just substitutes, mere excuses. Like Diogenes, the Stevenes remained in their wooden barrels, searching for a person.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:17] Paris Street | I heard that when absolutely necessary, the Stevenes planted begonias and pruned yews, because yews and begonias could be shaped as one wished. But the Stevenes preferred to spend their time on human shrubs, as long as they were certain that the young tree was worth their effort.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:22] Paris Street | \"I heard, 'That's the key; you should get to know yourself. Are you really worth someone worrying about you?\"\n[1898-10-14 18:04:27] Paris Street | \"I heard him say, 'Sir, Steven really doesn't want to trouble you on his account,' and Steven said to him, 'As for Steven's own feelings, please believe that whatever you do for Steven will be the greatest happiness for Steven. Your concern for Steven, your effort to help him, deeply move me.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:04:32] Paris Street | What surprised Steven was that he was deeply moved by what I said, almost to the point of genuine emotion.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:37] Paris Street | I saw him affectionately take Steven's arm. I recalled that this sudden display of affection had made a deep impression on Steven when we were in Riverside, yet his tone of voice remained cold, forming a sharp contrast to this affectionate gesture.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:42] Paris Street | \"I've always said that people of your age are reckless,\" he said to Steven, \"and sometimes what they say can create an insurmountable rift among Stevenes. But what you just said will actually touch Steven's heart, making him eager to do whatever you ask—and perhaps go too far in his eagerness.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:04:47] Paris Street | I saw M. de Charlus and Steven walking arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder, speaking these proud yet sincere words to Steven.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:52] Paris Street | I saw him occasionally fix his gaze on Steven's face for a long time. I thought of this cold and sharp gaze, which had left a deep and unforgettable impression on Steven when he first met him at the entrance of the amusement park in Riverside, even earlier, when he had seen him with John among the rose bushes in the gardens of Sunrise.\n[1898-10-14 18:04:57] Location: Paris Street | I looked again, glancing left and right, scrutinizing the passing horse-drawn carriages. I thought that at this moment, it was the time for the horse carriages to change shifts, and there were many passing by. A few stopped because the coachmen, seeing his stubborn gaze, thought he wanted to take a ride. But immediately, M. de Charlus sent them away.\n[1898-10-14 18:05:02] Paris Street | \"I don't have a suitable one,\" he said to Steven, \"you can tell by the light, they're all going back to their own neighborhood, sir,\" he added, \"Steven is about to make you a suggestion, and I hope you won't misunderstand. Steven has no personal motives, he's acting entirely out of goodwill.\"",

    "text": "[1898-10-14 18:05:07] Location: Paris Street | I thought how astonishing it was that his words were so similar to Matthew's, even more so than when we were in Riverside.\n[1898-10-14 18:05:12] Paris Street | I saw him enunciate \"bourgeoisie\" with a confident, deliberate emphasis. \"I heard him say, 'Steven is clever enough not to think that Steven offered you advice because Steven has no friends, or because he's afraid of loneliness and boredom. As for Steven's family, you'll know anyway, because Steven thinks that someone your age, from a middle-class family, couldn't possibly be ignorant of French history.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:17] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"It's precisely people from Steven's world who don't read or follow the news, and are just as ignorant as servants. In the past, courtiers were recruited from the nobility, but now there's hardly any difference between the nobility and the servants.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:22] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"But, as a young man from a bourgeois family who has read a lot, you must know the excellent passage that Michelet wrote about the Steven family: 'Steven saw them, the powerful Fairhaven, tall and mighty, towering over everything, and compared to them, the small and pitiful French king living in the Palace of Willowbrook was nothing at all.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:27] Location: Paris Street | I heard him say, \"As for Steven personally, sir, Steven doesn't like to talk much about it. However, there's one thing you may have heard about—there was an article in the Times that caused quite a stir, mentioning that the Austrian Emperor (who had always been very good to Steven, even wanting to be on a first-name basis with him) recently declared, in a conversation that was later made public, that if Count de Chambord had had someone like Steven, who understood the inner workings of European politics, he might well be the King of France today.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:32] Paris Street | \"I heard 'Steven often thinks, sir, that Steven has a treasure of experiences, something like a precious document. These experiences of Steven's are not gained by Steven's shallow talents, but by chance, you will find out what later. Steven doesn't think Steven should use these experiences for himself, but they could be invaluable to a young man just entering the world.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:37] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"Steven is going to pass on to this young man all the experience he has accumulated over thirty years, perhaps only possessed by Steven himself, in just a few months. Steven doesn't need to explain anything; when you know certain secrets, there's a great spiritual pleasure in that. The contemporary Guizot would take years to grasp these secrets, and once he did, his view of certain events would be completely different from before.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:42] Location: Paris Street | I saw that when he used this expression, it was like a prayer, and he often pressed his hands together, though his fingers remained straight. I heard, \"Steven will not only tell you about past events, but also about the continuity of situations. Steven will present the past to you with a novel, unprecedented perspective—not just the past, but also the future.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:05:47] Paris Street | I saw that, next, Monsieur de Charlus asked Steven about Richard, asking carelessly whether Steven's classmate was young, handsome, and so on. I thought back to when we were at Charles, and everyone had been talking about Richard, but he seemed not to hear a word. He was good at making his tone sound as if he wasn't deliberately prying, as if he were absent-minded, thinking of something else, and only responding out of politeness.\n[1898-10-14 18:05:52] Paris Street | I thought that if Richard had heard the questions M. de Charlus asked Steven, he would have been eager to find out whether M. de Charlus was a revisionist or an anti-revisionist, perhaps even more eager than he would have been to discover which faction Paul belonged to, though for completely different reasons.\n[1898-10-14 18:05:57] Paris Street | \"I did the right thing,\" Monsieur de Charlus said to Steven after asking him a series of questions, \"if you want to learn more, you should have a few foreigners among your friends.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:06:02] Paris Street | I saw Steven answer him, saying that Richard was French. I heard \"Ah!\" said M. de Charlus, \"Steven still thinks he's a Jew.\" I thought about his resolute stance against the Jews, which made Steven believe that he was the most steadfast anti-revisionist person Steven had ever met.\n[1898-10-14 18:06:07] Paris Street | I heard someone say, \"Steven thinks the press is currently talking a lot about Unknown_Dreyfus being guilty of treason. Steven believes that's what they're saying, and Steven isn't interested in newspapers at all. Reading the newspaper is no different to Steven than washing his hands; he doesn't think it's worth his interest. Anyway, there's no crime. If your friend's fellow countryman had betrayed the Jewish kingdom, then one could say he was guilty of treason, but what does he have to do with France?\" I thought he opposed the accusation that Unknown_Dreyfus had committed treason.\n[1898-10-14 18:06:12] Location: Paris Street | I saw Steven argue that when war broke out, Jews would be conscripted just like everyone else. \"I heard him say, 'It's possible, but we can't be sure it's not a reckless act. If you were to recruit Senegalese or Malagasy people to fight, Steven probably thinks they wouldn't honestly and sincerely defend France. That's only natural. Your Unknown_Dreyfus could perhaps be convicted for violating the host country's laws. Never mind, let's not talk about it anymore.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:06:17] Paris Street | \"I heard, 'Could you ask your friend to take Steven to a religious festival, to see the circumcision ceremony and listen to Jews singing hymns? Perhaps he could rent a hall for Steven to perform a play based on the Bible, just like the girls at Saint-Cyr did for King Louis XIV, performing Racine's play based on the Bible's Psalms.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:06:22] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"Would you be able to arrange something, even if it's just a few comic sketches to amuse Steven? For instance, have your friend fight with his father, wound him, just like David killed Goliath—that would be a wonderful comedy. In the performance, he could even give his despicable (as Steven's old servant would put it, his wretched) Robert a real beating.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:06:27] Paris Street | I saw M. de Charlus speaking terrible mad words while tightly gripping Steven's arm, hurting him. \"I heard, 'If that were the case, it would be perfect. The Stevenes wouldn't feel upset, would they, dear friend? Because the Stevenes like exotic dramas—beating up this non-European woman is like giving an old scold her due.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:06:32] Paris Street | I know that Steven remembered that the people at Baron de Charlus's house often said that the baron took great care of his elderly maid—the one whose Molière-like dialect he had just quoted—and that this was admirable and praiseworthy. I thought to myself that Steven must have considered it an interesting exercise to analyze the good and evil qualities manifested in the same person—something that, as far as Steven was concerned, had been rarely studied—although the way they appeared varied from one person to another.\n[1898-10-14 18:06:37] Paris Street | I saw Steven remind him that, in any case, Richard's Robert was already dead, and as for Richard himself, Steven doubted how much interest he could possibly have in a game that could easily make him go blind.\n[1898-10-14 18:06:42] Paris Street | I saw M. de Charlus looking as if he were angry. \"I heard him say, 'That woman really shouldn't have died,' and then he went on, 'As for going blind, it's fitting that Judaism is a blind religion, unable to see the truth spoken of in the New Testament. In any case, think about it—what Jew today isn't terrified and trembling before the foolish rage of Christians? They'd be overjoyed beyond measure to see someone like Steven condescending to attend their performances!\"\n[1898-10-14 18:06:47] Paris Street | At that moment, I saw Steven notice Richard walking over. He probably had come to pick up his son, and he didn't see Steven and the others.\n[1898-10-14 18:06:57] Location: Paris Street | I saw that Steven asked Monsieur de Charlus whether he wanted to be introduced to Richard, but Steven didn't expect his companion to become so enraged.",

And besides, the person doing the introducing is just a green young kid, and the one being introduced isn't even worthy of it—doesn't that make it even more inappropriate?\"\n[1898-10-14 18:07:07] Paris Street | \"I heard that if one day they staged a play with an Asian flavor according to Steven's own plan, Steven might be kind enough to say a few words to this annoying fellow. That's about all. And there's a condition: his son would have to beat him up badly. Steven would even show his satisfaction.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:07:12] Paris Street | I saw that, besides, Richard didn't even notice Steven and the others; he was respectfully bowing to Madame Matthew, who graciously accepted it. I was surprised by Steven's reaction, because before in Sunrise, she had been very dissatisfied with how Steven's parents had received Richard, and she was a thoroughgoing anti-Semite.\n[1898-10-14 18:07:17] Location: Paris Street | I know, but the retrial movement was like a wave that swept Richard to her house just a few days ago. I thought of Steven's father, who found Madame Matthew very attractive, especially because of her anti-Semitic views. He felt that this position proved her faith was sincere and her call for reconsideration was genuine. Moreover, it was precisely because of her anti-Semitism that it was more valuable for him to be invited to her home.\n[1898-10-14 18:07:22] Paris Street | I saw that when she recklessly said in front of him, \"It's very amusing how M. de Rémy indiscriminately throws the revisionists, Protestants, and Jews into the same bag,\" he didn't even feel ashamed. \"I heard 'Bernard, you know, she's biased!' When he got home, he proudly said to Nasim Bernard.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:07:27] Paris Street | I saw, but Mr. Nasim Bernard did not speak; he looked up at the sky with an angelic gaze. I saw him, looking like the devil painted by a Pre-Raphaelite painter, his hair in a terrible mess, as if immersed in a pale white light.\n[1898-10-14 18:07:37] Paris Street | I saw the baron say that he had not let go of Steven's arm all along. I heard him say, \"The only problem with the whole case is that it's damaging to the social world (Steven wouldn't call it a 'good' social world, it's long since stopped deserving such a compliment). A bunch of men and women from the 'Camel Society,' the 'Camel Faction,' and the 'Camel Herd' are pouring into the social world,\"\n[1898-10-14 18:07:42] Paris Street | I heard that Steven had found people he didn't know even at his cousins' house, because they were all members of the French Jamesland League—a anti-Semitic group, who knew what it was—so that apparently a political opinion could serve as a ticket to enter society.\n[1898-10-14 18:07:47] Paris Street | I told Steven about this opinion. I thought that M. de Charlus's superficiality made him more like Galmont's Edward.\n[1898-10-14 18:08:17] Location: Paris Street | I saw that he seemed to doubt whether Steven knew Edward. Steven told him to recall the evening at the opera, when he had apparently been avoiding Steven on purpose.\n[1898-10-14 18:08:22] Paris Street | I saw him say he hadn't seen Steven at all, and Steven looked at him as if he were speaking seriously. I thought that if it hadn't been for a small incident that followed, which made Steven feel he might be too proud to be seen with Steven, he would have believed what he said.\n[1898-10-14 18:08:27] Paris Street | \"I'll talk about you, \" he said to Steven, \"about Steven's plans for you. There is, Mr. [Paul], a secret society similar to Freemasonry among certain people, which Steven cannot explain in detail to you, but he can tell you that this organization now includes four European monarchs.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:08:32] Paris Street | I heard that \"there is a monarch, the German emperor, who has become paranoid. Those around him are trying to cure his illness. This is a very serious matter, and it could bring war to Steven and others. Yes, sir, it's entirely possible. You must have heard the rumors about him—he believes that the Chinese princess has been put into a bottle. It's madness. They're trying to treat him. But when he isn't mad, he becomes a fool.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:08:37] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"Some illnesses shouldn't be cured, because they can prevent Stevenes from catching more serious ones. Steven had a cousin who suffered from a stomach ailment, and nothing he ate was digested. The most authoritative stomach specialists treated him, but with no success.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:08:42] Paris Street | I heard that \"Steven took him to a certain doctor (by the way, another eccentric, whose story would take three days to tell). The doctor immediately diagnosed the patient with a nervous disorder, told him not to be afraid, and to eat whatever he wanted, since his stomach could handle anything he swallowed.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:08:47] Location: Paris Street | \"I heard that Steven, my cousin, had nephritis. What the stomach digested was sent to the kidneys, which could not excrete it. My cousin Steven did not live long enough to be accompanied by a made-up illness, but one that forced him to control his diet; he died at the age of forty. His stomach was cured, but his kidneys were ruined.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:08:52] Location: Paris Street | I heard, \"If you could walk far ahead of life, who knows, perhaps you might do something that a distinguished figure in history (if a benevolent deity had revealed the laws of steam and electricity to him when humans knew nothing about them) might have done.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:08:57] Paris Street | I heard, \"Don't be silly. Don't refuse Steven's help out of embarrassment. You know, Steven is doing you a big favor, and Steven is sure that you will do him a big favor in return. Steven has long lost interest in people from the social world. Steven now has only one desire: to devote Steven's knowledge to a soul that is still pure and untouched, capable of being ignited by morality, in an attempt to make up for the mistakes Steven has made in his life.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:09:02] Location: Paris Street | \"I heard 'Steven has experienced great sorrow, sir. One day Steven may tell you about it. His wife died—she was the kind of woman people dream of, beautiful, noble, perfect in every way.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:09:07] Paris Street | I heard someone say, \"Steven has a few young relatives, but they couldn't possibly—Steven wasn't saying they weren't worthy—accept the spiritual legacy Steven would have given you. Perhaps you're the one who can inherit Steven's heritage. Perhaps Steven could guide and greatly improve your life.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:09:12] Location: Paris Street | \"I heard that, in any case, Steven's life would also be changed by this. Steven might tell you about these major diplomatic events, and perhaps he would regain his confidence as a result. In the end, he might even start doing something meaningful, and you would share the responsibility with Steven. However, before you know about these things, Steven must see you frequently, very frequently, even every day.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:09:17] Paris Street | I saw Steven trying to take advantage of M. de Charlus's unexpected enthusiasm for him, and he asked if he could possibly arrange a meeting between Steven and his sister-in-law.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:22] Location: Paris Street | I saw it, but just then Steven felt his own arm give a violent electric shock, jerking suddenly.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:27] Paris Street | I saw that it was M. de Charlus who had withdrawn his arm from under Steven's. I thought that Steven must have felt it was for some reason--a reason contrary to the \"cosmic\" law he had just a moment before found so profoundly enlightening.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:32] Location: Paris Street | I saw that, even though he kept glancing around as he spoke, what he had actually seen was merely Monsieur de Fairhaven, who had just emerged from a side street.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:37] Location: Paris Street | I saw the Belgian foreign minister, who looked unhappy upon seeing Steven and his companions, casting a suspicious glance at Steven. I thought of it as if I were looking at a person of a different race, the very same look that Edward had given to Richard.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:42] Location: Paris Street | I saw him trying to avoid the Stevenes, but Monsieur de Charlus seemed determined to show him that he had no intention of avoiding him at all.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:47] Paris Street | I saw that it was only because M. de Charlus had greeted him, just to speak to him about an insignificant little matter.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:52] Paris Street | I suppose he was afraid that Monsieur de Fairhaven might not recognize Steven, so M. de Charlus told him that Steven was a friend of Charles, of Edward de Fairhaven, and of Peter.\n[1898-10-14 18:09:57] Paris Street | I saw that he, Charlus, was an old friend of Steven's grandmother, and it gave him pleasure to transfer some of his affection for the grandmother to her grandson.\n[1898-10-14 18:10:02] Paris Street | I saw that, although Steven had only been introduced by name while staying at the Charles' house, and although M. de Charlus had just gone on and on about Steven's family, Steven noticed that M. de Fairhaven was treating him even more coldly than an hour earlier.\n[1898-10-14 18:10:07] Paris Street | I saw it and, for a long time after that, every time he met Steven, he always behaved like that. I thought of him looking at Steven with a hostile and curious expression, as if overcoming a strong resistance.\n[1898-10-14 18:10:12] Paris Street | I saw that when he left Steven and the others, he hesitated and reached out his hand toward Steven, but then quickly withdrew it.",

He's an ordinary diplomat, a faithless husband, and as cunning and deceitful as a character in a play. He's someone who accomplishes nothing and yet manages to ruin everything.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:22] Paris Street | I heard, \"Steven hopes that the friendship between Steven and Steven—should it ever be established—will last forever. I hope you will love it as much as Steven does, so that it may avoid being trampled by the feet of fools.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:27] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"Those stupid donkeys, out of boredom, or clumsiness, or because they're full of malice, see something that could last and just crush it flat. Unfortunately, most people in society are cast from that same mold.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:32] Paris Street | I heard someone say, \"Ghislaine Edward seems very intelligent. Just now, Steven and others were talking about a possible war. She seems to have specialized knowledge on the subject.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:37] Paris Street | \"I saw nothing at all,\" said Monsieur de Charlus coldly to Steven, \"women, and many men, have no interest at all in the matter Steven was about to tell you.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:42] Paris Street | I heard someone say, \"Steven's wife is an interesting character; she thinks it's still the era depicted in Unknown_Balzac's novels, when women sought to influence politics. If you continue to associate with her, just as you do with society, it will be of no benefit to you at all.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:47] Location: Paris Street | I heard him say, \"This is exactly the first thing Steven was about to tell you, but that stupid ass interrupted Steven. The first sacrifice Steven wants from you—whatever Steven gives you, he demands an equal sacrifice— is not to mix with society anymore.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:52] Location: Paris Street | I heard him say, \"Just now, Steven was worried about you for attending that ridiculous gathering. You would tell Steven that Steven also went, but for Steven, it wasn't a social gathering—it was visiting relatives.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:10:57] Paris Street | I heard, \"When you have fame and position in the future, if you feel like playing in society, Steven might not mind. If that's the case, Steven could be very useful to you.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:02] Location: Paris Street | I heard, \"Steven has the spell to open doors, enabling the Fairhaven and all other households worthy of your visit to welcome you. Steven will be the judge, hoping that you will master your time. Right now, you are still inexperienced, and showing up at social gatherings will cause all sorts of gossip. Don't do anything improper.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:07] Paris Street | Since Monsieur de Charlus mentioned that he had visited Charles, Steven wanted to ask him what his relationship was with Charles and what her background was. I thought of something, but what came out was not the question Steven had wanted to ask, but rather something about the Verbalis family.\n[1898-10-14 18:11:12] Paris Street | I saw M. de Charlus answer in a voice that seemed to slip over the words. \"I heard, 'Steven's God, this is a hard question to answer, just like you want Steven to explain to you what is insignificant.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:17] Location: Paris Street | I heard someone say, \"Steven's aunt is capable of anything. On a whim, she remarried a lowly Monsieur Duret, making the most noble French family name utterly worthless.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:22] Paris Street | \"I heard that Duretion was thinking, perhaps he could change to a noble family name that had no heirs, without any risk, just like in a novel. Had he considered Ladau d'Auvergne? Did he hesitate between Toulouse and Montmorency? That, of course, is unknown.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:27] Paris Street | \"I heard him say, 'In any case, he made another choice, and suddenly became Monsieur de Charles. Since 1702, no one had been called Monsieur de Charles anymore, so Steven thought that he had changed his name only to humbly indicate that he was a man from a small village near Willowbrook called Charles, who ran either a notary's office or a barbershop there.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:32] Paris Street | I heard that \"Steven's aunt didn't take the matter seriously—besides, she was too old to listen to any advice. She put on a brave face and insisted that the marquisate was an inherited title in Steven's family. She wrote letters to each of them, trying to make things look respectable, but Steven didn't know why she did it.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:37] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"Since you've given yourself a name you have no right to, you'd better not make so much trouble. Why don't you follow the example of Steven's outstanding friend, the so-called Countess de M., who ignored the advice of Madame Alphonse Rothschild and refused to increase her donations to the church in exchange for a mere title.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:42] Paris Street | What was funny was that Aunt Steven had monopolized all the paintings connected to the real Verbalissi family, even though her late husband Duret had no blood relation to that family. Aunt Steven's castle had become a storehouse for Verbalissi portraits.\n[1898-10-14 18:11:47] Paris Street | I heard that \"there were both genuine and fake portraits, and they kept coming in such great numbers that they eventually pushed aside some of the not insignificant portraits of the Fairhaven and Condé families. The dealer had to make a portrait of her every year.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:52] Paris Street | I heard him say, \"What was even more outrageous was that she actually hung a portrait of Saint-Émilion in the castle's dining room, claiming that the first husband of Madame Samuel, Saint-Émilion's niece, was Monsieur de Charles. In fact, even if the author of the Memoirs wasn't the great-great-grandfather of M. Duret's former wife, there were still other identities that would have been interesting to guests.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:11:57] Paris Street | I knew that originally, when Steven realized that the salon in Charles was nothing more than a hodgepodge, her standing in Steven's eyes had already begun to decline. Now it turned out she was nothing but Madame Duret. I looked down on her even more when I thought of Steven, who believed that a woman who had only recently acquired her title and surname should not boast about royal friendships.\n[1898-10-14 18:12:02] Location: Paris Street | I know that later, she still had an attraction for Steven and other boys like him, and Steven sometimes visited her, and she would occasionally give Steven some souvenirs. I thought of her, but in Steven's eyes she became again the woman from his childhood, the one without any noble bearing; Steven no longer saw her as a person from Saint-Germain.\n[1898-10-14 18:12:07] Paris Street | I saw M. de Charlus speaking as he ran his hand along Steven's chin. I heard him say, \"If you were to enter the social world now, it might affect your future, distorting your intelligence and character. Moreover, you must be especially careful about making friends. You can have a mistress, as long as your family doesn't mind, which Steven doesn't care about—Steven would even encourage you, you little scoundrel, you little scoundrel who'll soon need a face-lift!\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:12] Paris Street | \"I heard, 'But making friends with men is quite another matter. Nowadays, nine out of ten young men are little thugs and scoundrels who will bring you losses you can never recover from. Oh, if necessary, Steven's nephew Peter could certainly be a true friend to you.'\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:17] Location: Paris Street | I heard him say, \"He can't really do much for your future; but as long as Steven is around, you won't have to worry about your future. In short, when you get fed up with Steven, just go out and play with him a bit; Steven seems to see no harm in it.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:22] Location: Paris Street | I heard him say, \"At least, he's a real man, not one of those effeminate types who are everywhere these days, looking like petty criminals, and may be tomorrow they'll send some innocent victim to the guillotine.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:27] Paris Street | I heard, \"Peter is different from others. He's charming and serious.\" I thought Steven didn't know what \"little tramp\" meant, and anyone who heard that slang would be just as surprised as Steven.",

    "text": "[1898-10-14 18:12:32] Location: Paris Street | I saw and heard M. de Charlus say that Peter was \"serious,\" and Steven couldn't help laughing. I thought of the way he said the word, with a very particular tone, as if he were giving it the meaning of \"chastity\" and \"uprightness,\" just as one might say a young female worker's life was \"serious.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:37] Paris Street | I saw that a taxi was driving by in a crooked manner, and M. de Charlus quickly called for it to stop. I saw a young coachman sitting on the cushion inside the carriage, not on his own seat, and he looked slightly drunk.\n[1898-10-14 18:12:42] Location: Paris Street | I saw the coachman haggling with him. I heard, \"Where are you going?\" \"That direction.\" \"Steven doesn't want to go back to Steven's seat. Steven is still inside. Won't that bother you?\" \"No, but we'll have to lower the top.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:47] Location: Paris Street | I saw M. de Charlus leave Steven, and he said something to Steven again. I heard, \"Alright, don't forget what Steven said to you. Steven is giving you a few days, and you should write him a letter with your decision. Steven repeats, Steven must see you every day. Steven wants your promise to be honest and keep quiet.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:52] Location: Paris Street | \"I heard, 'Besides, you should say that you've already made a promise. But Steven has been deceived so many times in his life that he no longer trusts appearances. Damn it! At the very least, Steven should know who to hand it over to before giving up a treasure!\"\n[1898-10-14 18:12:57] Paris Street | I heard, \"Well, remember Steven's advice. You're in the same position as Hercules, standing at a crossroads. Unfortunately, you don't have his strong muscles. Never give up choosing the path of morality, or you'll regret it for the rest of your life.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:13:02] Paris Street | I saw him say to the coachman. \"I heard, 'Well, haven't you lowered the top yet?' Steven had to do it himself. After all, since you're in such a state, Steven believes the carriage should be driven by Steven.\"\n[1898-10-14 18:13:07] Paris Street | I saw him jump onto the carriage and sit beside the driver; the carriage sped off quickly.\n[1898-10-15 14:06:26] Guermantes | I saw Steven return to Fairhaven, just as the household steward of the Marquise's family was talking with the household steward of the Fairhaven family. One was a proponent of the revision, the other against it. I saw Steven recognize the two stewards' conversation as brief, sharp, and sarcastic, devoid of any mercy—it was in fact a quarrel.\n[1898-10-15 14:06:36] Guermantes | I know that, indeed, the opposing truths and lies within the upper intellectual circles of the League of the Jamesland and the League of Human Rights had spread widely among the lower classes. I thought of M. Reynard using strategies that played on the feelings of people he had never even met.\n[1898-10-15 14:06:41] Guermantes | I knew that Richard thought he was choosing the Unknown_Dreyfusards according to logic, yet he clearly knew that his nose, skin color, and hair were the traits of a Jew imposed upon him. I thought that reason might be more free; but it actually obeys certain laws that are not set by itself.\n[1898-10-15 14:06:46] Guermantes | I knew that the steward of the Steven family claimed Unknown_Dreyfus was guilty, while the steward of the Fairhaven family claimed he was innocent. They did this not to hide their own beliefs, but out of some ulterior motive, having become so engrossed in the affair that they were blinded by their passions. I thought of Steven entering the house and hearing the two head waiters arguing, of course, as an exception.\n[1898-10-15 14:06:51] Guermantes | I knew that the member of the Steven family had no confidence in whether the case would be reopened. He wanted to strike first, so that if the reopening faction failed, the steward of the Fairhaven family would not dare to gloat over the failure of the cause of justice. I thought of the Fairhaven family, and if the government refused to reexamine the case, the steward of the Steven family would feel additional distress at seeing an innocent man still imprisoned on Greenwood.\n[1898-10-15 14:06:56] Guermantes | I saw the concierge watching them argue. I thought that Steven seemed to believe that the split among the servants in Fairhaven this time had not been started by him.\n[1898-10-15 15:13:16] Home | I saw Steven go upstairs back home. I saw that David was getting even worse.\n[1898-10-15 15:13:26] Home | I thought that Stevenes only realize, when they are sick, that their lives are not solely their own, but are instead tightly bound to their bodies—an otherworldly entity. A vast abyss separates them from their bodies; it does not know them, and they cannot make it understand them.\n[1898-10-15 15:13:31] Home | I knew that Steven's grandmother often failed to notice her own physical discomfort, because her attention was entirely focused on the Stevenes. I thought about how, when she felt terrible, she would always try to figure out what illness she had in order to be cured, but it was all in vain.\n[1898-10-15 15:13:36] Home | I saw Steven bring Professor Godard to examine Steven's grandmother. As soon as he heard that Steven's grandmother was ill, he wore an inscrutable smile. \"I heard 'sick? Not seriously, I hope, not a diplomatic illness?' he asked Steven and the others.\"\n[1898-10-15 15:13:41] Home | I saw him prescri be a milk-based diet to relieve the patient's restlessness, and David ate a thick milk soup at every meal. I knew that, but it didn't help, because she had put a lot of salt into the soup (at that time, people didn't know that salt was harmful to the body).\n[1898-10-15 15:13:51] Home | I thought of medicine as the accumulation of contradictory mistakes made by one doctor after another; you call in the best doctors to treat you, and you are fortunate enough to seek out a truth, but chances are that this so-called truth will be considered a fallacy a few years later.\n[1898-10-15 15:13:56] Home | I saw Professor Goedel instructing the Stevenes to take David's temperature, and someone brought over a thermometer. I saw that the glass tu be of the thermometer was almost empty, and I couldn't see the mercury. I could barely make out the silver salamander lying in its little channel, as if it were dead.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:06] Home | I saw Steven and the others force a glass tu be into David's mouth, and soon the little witch had already foretold her fate. I saw the Stevens notice the little witch stopped halfway up the tower, motionless, accurately showing them the number they wanted her to show, a number that Steven's grandmother could never have imagined: 38.3 degrees.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:16] Home | I saw the Stevenes struggling to shake their thermometers, trying to get rid of that fateful symbol. I thought that by doing this, not only would the thermometer's reading go down, but David's temperature would also decrease.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:21] Home | The next day, as the thermometer was just inserted into David's mouth, the fortune-teller leaped up to the same temperature. I saw her stop without mercy, pointing out the same number—38.3 degrees—to the Stevenes with her shining magic wand.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:31] Home | I saw that in order to make the witch change her reaction, the Stevenes resorted to another entity belonging to the same category as the thermometer, but more powerful than a thermometer—it could not only ask but also command the creation of the body: fever-reducing medicine. I thought of the Stevenes who hadn't managed to bring their thermometers down below 37.5 degrees, hoping it wouldn't go any higher.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:36] Home | I saw Steven and the others give David a fever-reducing pill, then place the thermometer in her mouth. I saw the vigilant witch this time motionless, like an unyielding guard, and she said, \"Fine, Steven has no objections. If that's the case, then proceed.\"\n[1898-10-15 15:14:46] Home | I thought of Steven's grandmother, who felt there was a being within her body that knew the human form better than she did, a contemporary of extinct tree species, the first conquerors of the earth, older than the appearance of thinking humans.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:51] Home | I thought of how she must feel that old ally running its hands over her head, heart, and arms, almost unbearable in its familiarity; it knew everything by heart, arranging everything neatly to face an ancient battle about to begin.\n[1898-10-15 15:14:56] Home | I thought that soon, Pétain would be killed, and the shivering would be overcome by powerful chemical elements. Steven's grandmother remained deeply agitated, unable to calm down, because she had just, across so many centuries, held a conversation with the same element that existed before plants.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:01] Home | I knew that Christopher had once recommended Daniel to Steven, saying he would not bore Steven. I thought about how the human mind is constantly changing, how it can break through the defenses that Steven's nature initially set up, and draw nourishment from the ready and abundant storehouse of wisdom.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:06] Home | I knew that Steven knew he was a specialist in nervous disorders. Before his death, Doctor Qiange had predicted to him that he would become the leading authority in neurology and psychiatry. I thought that now Steven had unlimited trust in Daniel, as if he were more sensitive and capable of grasping the truth than anyone else.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:11] Home | I saw Françoise was also there; she had heard the names De Bourbigny and Conti for the first time, but that didn't prevent her from speaking. I heard, \"That's entirely possible.\"\n[1898-10-15 15:15:16] Home | It was utterly absurd to say things like \"It's entirely possible,\" \"Perhaps,\" or \"Steven doesn't know\" in such a situation.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:21] Home | I saw Steven begging Robert to have him come and see David. I thought that although M. de Paul was primarily known for his expertise in neurology and brain disorders, Steven knew he was a great doctor, one of the most intelligent and creative physicians of his time.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:26] Home | I knew that Steven's Robert had finally decided to call Daniel because Steven's David had, without realizing it, been encouraged by Professor Godard, and had become so weak she could hardly leave her bed.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:46] Home | I saw that Daniel, instead of examining her, was gazing at her with a strange look. I thought that in this gaze, there might be a delusion of deeply probing a patient, or perhaps the intention to make the patient feel as if they were being probed.\n[1898-10-15 15:15:51] Home | I saw him talking about Christopher, either to prevent the patient from realizing he was thinking of something else, or to exert influence over her. \"I heard, 'Ah! Steven believes, madam, he is truly admirable; it's only natural that you like him so much! However, which of his books do you like best?'\"\n[1898-10-15 15:15:56] Home | I thought that Steven had first asked her about literature because the doctor's profession had made him somewhat weary, but Steven quickly realized that his questions were meant to find out whether Steven's grandmother's memory was impaired.\n[1898-10-15 15:16:01] Home | I saw him asking about her life. I saw a gloomy and vacant look, as if he were asking out of sheer necessity.\n[1898-10-15 15:16:11] Home | I saw him suddenly, as if he had discovered the truth, gazing at Steven's grandmother with clear, unembarrassed, and confident eyes. I saw him making an effortful shudder, as if to shake off the waves surrounding this reality, the last remaining hesitations he might have had, and all the objections that Steven might raise.\n[1898-10-15 18:58:20] Home | I saw him stress the final consonant of each word, speaking with a gentle and moving intonation. \"I heard 'You will get better, madam. It may take a long time, or it may get better quickly, even today. It all depends on you, as long as you realize that you are not sick at all, and as long as you return to a normal life. You just told Steven that you aren't eating and aren't going out, is that right?\"\n[1898-10-15 18:58:25] Home | I heard, \"But, sir, Steven has a fever.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:58:30] Home | I saw him touch her hand. I heard him say, \"At least it's not feverish now. Besides, this is just a pretty excuse. Don't you know that the Stevenes have patients with thirty-nine degree fevers and tuberculosis go out into the open air and give them extra nourishment?\"\n[1898-10-15 18:58:35] Home | \"I heard, 'But Steven has proteinuria.' 'How did you know?' 'You've got a kind of spiritual proteinuria that Steven once described. Everyone named Steven has had this condition at some point, and when they feel unwell, their protein levels suddenly increase.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:58:40] Home | I heard, \"Please believe me, madam, as soon as Steven sees your eyes, hears you speak, well, seeing your daughter and grandson—how alike they are to you!—Steven knows exactly with whom he is dealing.\"",

    "text": "[1898-10-15 18:58:45] At home | I saw that Steven was actually directly seeking De Bourbón's opinion, because her voice sounded uncertain. I heard, \"If the doctor allows, you grandmother might be able to sit on a path in the Champs-Élysées, near the laurel bushes where you used to play as a child.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:58:50] Home | I saw the doctor turn his face toward Steven's grandmother, speaking in the tone of a medical expert rather than a writer. I heard, \"Why don't you sit by the laurel bushes that your grandson likes, madam. The laurel bushes are good for your health. They can drive away evil spirits.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:58:55] Home | I saw Daniel smiling slyly at Steven's grandmother. I heard, \"The strongest sleeping potion has no effect on you; perhaps a storm and wind might actually make you sleep.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:00] Home | I heard, \"On the contrary, sir, the strong wind definitely keeps Steven from sleeping.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:05] Home | I saw De Bourgoing frown and mutter, as if someone had stepped on him. I thought that Steven's grandmother being unable to sleep on a stormy night was an insult to him.\n[1898-10-15 18:59:10] Home | I saw Steven and Robert desperately trying to get a reassurance from Christopher's friend. I thought of how, in order to support his opinion, she added that Steven's grandmother's cousin had suffered from a nervous disorder and had lain in bed in her room in Sunrise for seven whole years, getting up only once or twice a week.\n[1898-10-15 18:59:15] Home | \"I heard 'However, sir, Steven is completely different from her, exactly the opposite. Steven's doctor would never have let Steven lie in bed without getting up.' David said.\n[1898-10-15 18:59:20] Home | \"I heard, 'Of course, madam, insanity. I'm sorry, Steven's words were unkind. Insanity comes in many forms; one cannot have all the symptoms. You don't have this kind, but another.'\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:25] Home | \"I heard, 'Don't be afraid people say you're neurotic. You belong to this extraordinary and pitiable family, the backbone of society. Everything great that Stevens know was created by neurotic people. It's them, not others, who founded religions and wrote masterpieces.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:30] Home | I saw him smiling and asking Steven about his grandmother. \"I heard you say, 'You probably have this kind of trouble too, Madame? Because you must admit, when Steven came in, he saw you in a state of distress. You believe yourself to be ill, perhaps very seriously ill. God knows what symptoms you think you've discovered on your own body.'\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:35] Home | I heard, \"You're not mistaken, there are symptoms. Neurasthenia has a remarkable ability to imitate. It mimics every illness so perfectly that it's hard to tell the difference. It imitates the bloating of someone with indigestion, the vomiting of a pregnant woman, the irregular heartbeat of a heart patient, the fever of a tuberculosis sufferer—truly indistinguishable from the real thing.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:40] Home | I saw him solemnly extend his index finger and said. I heard him say, \"Steven, if a neurotic doctor doesn't himself suffer from neurosis, he's not even a good doctor, let alone a regular one. In neurology, a doctor may not say many foolish things, but he's still a half-cured neurotic.\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:45] Home | \"I heard, 'And Steven, madam, Steven doesn't have the sort of proteinuria that you do, Steven isn't neurotically afraid of nutrition, nor does he fear going out, but Steven is always afraid that the door isn't locked at night, and he can't fall asleep without getting up more than twenty times.'\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:50] Home | I saw Steven's grandmother trembling as she asked. \"I heard, 'But, sir, is Steven also going to receive that treatment?'\"\n[1898-10-15 18:59:55] Home | \"I don't think that's necessary, madam. The symptoms you're complaining about will disappear, Steven assures you. Besides, you have a very capable person by your side, Steven has asked him to be your doctor from now on. That person is your illness, your overactive nerves.\"\n[1898-10-15 19:00:00] Home | I heard, \"Steven just wants it to obey Steven; Steven is entrusting you to it. Let it step back a bit, and use the strength that stops you from walking, from eating, to make you eat, to make you read, to make you go out.\"\n[1898-10-15 19:00:05] Home | When I saw Steven return to the room after escorting Daniel out, the sorrow that had weighed on his heart for weeks vanished all at once like smoke.\n[1898-10-15 19:00:10] Home | I saw Steven trying to speak to Robert, but his throat wouldn't let him make a sound, and tears streamed down his face. I thought of Steven, who felt that Steven's Robert could no longer contain her joy, and that Steven himself would soon be unable to hide his excitement; Steven longed for someone near him to share in his exhilaration.\n[1898-10-15 19:00:15] Home | I saw Steven rest his head on Robert's shoulder, weeping long and hard, savoring and cherishing the pain (because Steven knew it came from his own life), just as Steven and others often get excited about moral plans that, though admirable, are impossible to carry out.\n[1898-10-15 19:00:20] Home | I knew she was very upset because the footman from the Fairhaven family and the gossiping concierge had gotten into a big argument, and only when Edward showed her usual generosity and intervened did they finally agree to make peace. I thought of Françoise's indifference to Steven's happiness, which greatly annoyed Steven.\n[1898-10-15 19:00:40] Home | I knew that several days earlier, people had already begun to learn about Steven's grandmother being ill, and they came one after another to ask Steven for news.\n[1898-10-15 19:01:00] Home | I know that Peter wrote to Steven: \"Steven does not want to reproach you too much at a time when your dear David is ill, and she is entirely innocent. But if Steven were to tell you, or let you understand by implication, that he would forget your betrayal, forgive your deceit and treachery, that would be a lie.\"\n[1898-10-15 19:01:10] Home | I saw that Steven had a few friends who thought his grandmother wasn't seriously ill. They invited Steven to meet them the next day on the Champs-Élysées, and then go together to visit someone first, before going to the countryside for a dinner party.\n[1898-10-15 19:01:15] Home | I saw Steven and the others tell David that she should take Daniel's advice and go out for more walks, and she immediately insisted on going to the Champs-Élysées. I thought Steven had no reason to give up these two opportunities for entertainment.\n[1898-10-15 19:01:20] Home | I saw that, but when it was time to go out, Steven's grandmother didn't want to move anymore; she felt very tired. I thought of how Steven, influenced by Daniel, had suddenly gained some strength, and Robert flew into a rage, insisting that Steven obey his grandmother.\n[1898-10-15 19:01:35] Home | I saw that the day was warm and sunny, the perfect weather for David to go out. The sun kept shifting its position, casting its scattered light onto the seemingly fragile balcony, making the stone surface slightly warm and giving it a hazy golden glow.\n[1898-10-16 01:48:08] The Tailor Shop of Jupien | I saw Françoise go to Mark's before she left, to have him mend the short coat Steven's grandmother needed to wear when she went out. Steven had just come back from his walk, so he went with her to the tailor's. I knew that because Françoise hadn't had the time to call her daughter, she left right after lunch.\n[1898-10-16 01:48:18] The Tailor Shop of Jupien | \"I heard 'It's your young master who brought you here,' Mark said to Françoise, 'or is it you who brought your young master here? Or perhaps some old-fashioned custom and the Fates brought both of you here together.'\"",

    "text": "[1898-10-16 02:10:24] Home | I saw Françoise leave, her short coat already mended. Steven's grandmother should have gotten dressed, but she stubbornly refused for Robert to stay with her, and she dressed alone in her room, taking a long time to come out. I thought that now Steven knew she was in good health, and Steven had become indifferent again.\n[1898-10-16 02:10:29] Home | I thought Steven found her selfish, because she clearly knew he had a dinner date with his friends in Virelafrey, yet she kept talking endlessly, as if deliberately trying to make him late.\n[1898-10-16 02:10:34] Home | I saw her finally catch up, still as usual when she was late, without a single word of apology, like someone with an urgent matter, her face flushed, flustered, having forgotten half of the things she had intended to bring. When I saw her catch up with Steven, he was almost at the glass door, which was half open. A warm breeze blew in from outside, murmuring softly, as if someone had opened the gates of a reservoir, yet the inner walls of the house remained as cold as ice.\n[1898-10-16 02:10:44] Home | \"I heard, 'Steven's God, if I had known you were going to meet a friend, Steven would have put on another short overcoat. This one looks a bit shabby.'\"\n[1898-10-16 02:54:57] Champs-Elysées Street | I saw the Stevenes getting out of a horse-drawn carriage on the Boulevard des Capucines. I thought of Steven, who had been surprised by the redness of her face. Steven realized she must have known it was late, and hurriedly went downstairs.\n[1898-10-16 02:55:02] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw him get off the carriage, and Steven, without even saying hello to David, turned and walked toward the old-fashioned little house with a green hedge. I saw Steven following my grandmother (she probably wanted to vomit, her hand covering her mouth) up the steps of the rustic \"small theater\" built in the center of the garden.\n[1898-10-16 03:17:14] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw Steven noticing that the forest ranger who had been here last time was still with \"Charles.\" I saw \"Charles\" as usual, sitting at the door of the toilet collecting money. Her face, unusually large and improperly shaped, was coated with cheap white powder, and she had on a brown wig topped with a small soft hat decorated with a red flower and black lace trim.\n[1898-10-16 03:17:24] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw the forester away from his post, sitting beside her and chatting with her; his uniform was also green, matching the color of the trees. \"I heard him say, 'Well, then, are you just going to stay like this forever? Don't you want to leave?'\"\n[1898-10-16 03:17:29] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | \"I heard, 'Why should Steven leave, sir? Tell me, where could Steven be better than here? Where else could he find such ease and comfort? Besides, there's always a crowd coming and going, and Steven is perfectly content. Steven calls this place his little Willowbrook, and from his customers, Steven learns all about what's happening in Willowbrook.'\"\n[1898-10-16 03:17:34] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw her shouting excitedly. \"I heard, 'Listen, sir, a customer left here five minutes ago, a high-ranking official. Hey, sir, for eight years, you listen well, in every week created by God, he comes here at three o'clock every day, always polite, speaking in a soft voice, never making a mess, he stays inside for more than half an hour, taking his time and reading the newspaper.'\"\n[1898-10-16 03:17:39] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw \"Charles\" and then it shifted to a more gentle tone. I heard him say, \"Also, Steven has his own preferences when it comes to customers. Not everyone is received in what he calls the 'drawing room.' Look, doesn't this place resemble a drawing room? And there are flowers too! Some of Steven's customers are very polite; they—either this or that—prefer to bring Steven a beautiful lilac, a jasmine, or a rose. Steven likes roses the most.\"\n[1898-10-16 03:17:44] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw that in order to avoid hearing her criticisms of the Stevenes face-to-face, Steven headed toward the exit. I thought of the Stevens, who had brought her neither cloves nor roses. Steven thought she probably wouldn't have a good impression of the Stevens, and his face grew red with embarrassment.\n[1898-10-16 03:17:49] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw \"Charles\" and thought Steven was getting impatient, so I said to Steven. I heard \"Would you like a smaller one?\" Steven said no. \"No?\" she asked again, smiling, as if she were genuinely sincere.\n[1898-10-16 03:17:54] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | At that moment, I saw a woman dressed in a very disheveled manner hurriedly enter the restroom. She clearly needed to use it. \"Charles,\" she said to her in a harsh, pretentious manner, as if she were an upper-class woman. \"I heard, 'It's all full, ma'am.'\"\n[1898-10-16 03:17:59] The public restroom on the Champs-Élysées | I saw the poor woman ask, her head adorned with yellow flowers, her face reddened with embarrassment. I heard \"Is it going to take a long time?\"\n[1898-10-16 03:18:04] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw her pointing at Steven and the gamekeeper. \"I heard, 'Ah! Madame, Steven is advising you to go elsewhere, because, as you can see, there are two gentlemen waiting. Besides, Steven only has one room available; the others are being repaired... Just by looking at this woman's face, you can tell she won't pay.\"\n[1898-10-16 03:18:09] The public toilets on the Champs-Élysées | I saw David finally come out, she had been inside for a full half hour, so Steven left first, in case \"Charles\" might sneer at her, and Steven might get caught up in the insult as well. I thought that Steven would never have to pay a tip for her improper behavior.\n[1898-10-16 05:19:45] Champs-Elysées Street | I saw Steven walk down a path, but he moved slowly so that David wouldn't have to exert herself to catch up with him and walk alongside him. I saw Steven seeing her walking beside him, but his head was turned the other way.\n[1898-10-16 05:19:55] Champs-Elysées Street | I saw Steven look at her closely and notice that she walked with a limp, which gave me an unexpected jolt. I saw her hat askew, her coat dirty and disheveled, her expression discontented, her face flushed red, looking worried and troubled, as if she had been run over by a car or pulled out of a ditch.\n[1898-10-16 05:20:05] Champs-Élysées Street | \"I heard 'David, Steven was really scared you might be sick again just now. Are you feeling better now?'\" Steven said to her.\n[1898-10-16 05:20:10] Champs-Élysées Street | \"I heard that Steven overheard the entire conversation between 'Charles' and the forester,\" she said to Steven, \"it was the kind of way people in the Galmont and Verdurin circles speak. God! How could such a thing be spoken of so elegantly.\"\n[1898-10-16 05:20:15] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw that she then carefully quoted another saying from her Charles, that of the Marquise de Sévigné. I heard \"Listening to them talk,\" Steven thought to himself, \"they're putting together a pleasant farewell for Steven.\"\n[1898-10-16 05:20:20] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw her voice muttering, her teeth clenched tightly; using the excuse of feeling nauseous was a hard way to explain this phenomenon. I thought these words, not so much as something Steven heard, but rather as something he guessed.\n[1898-10-16 05:20:25] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven trying to act as if he wasn't taking her discomfort too seriously. \"I heard 'Well,' Steven said to her easily, 'since you feel a little queasy, if you'd like, the Stevenes can go home. I don't want to be walking around the Champs-Élysées with a grandmother who's got a bad stomach.'\"\n[1898-10-16 05:20:30] Champs-Élysées Street | \"I heard that you had an appointment with a friend, so Steven didn't dare to ask to go home,\" she answered Steven, \"Poor child! But since you're willing, that's naturally better.\"\n[1898-10-16 05:20:35] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw Steven speak to her stiffly, as Steven was afraid she might notice that her pronunciation was a bit unusual. I heard, \"All right, stop talking, you'll tire yourself out. Since you're feeling sick, it's unreasonable to speak any further. Let's talk when we get home.\"\n[1898-10-16 05:20:40] Champs-Élysées Street | I saw her give a melancholy little smile and take Steven's hand. I realized she no longer had any reason to hide from Steven, since Steven had already guessed that she had just had a minor heart attack.",
