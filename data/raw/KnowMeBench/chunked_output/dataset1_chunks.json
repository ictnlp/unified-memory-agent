    "text": "[1969-08-15 14:00:00] Rocky path | I saw a bus coming toward me. It was a mild, cloudy day in August 1969, and I was walking along the outermost trail of the southern islands. Around me were gardens, rocky outcrops, and fields; the path rose and fell along steep slopes, sometimes shielded by dense woods on both sides, sometimes opening up to reveal the sea.\n[1969-08-15 14:00:30] Rocky path | I watched the vehicle cross a bridge, driving down the narrow fjord with its right turn signal blinking before finally stopping. The bus belonged to Aucity Shipping Company, painted in two shades of brown.\n[1969-08-15 14:01:00] Rocky path | I saw the door open and a small family step out.\n[1969-08-15 14:01:05] Rocky path | I noticed the father was a tall, thin man wearing a white shirt and light-colored polyester trousers, carrying two suitcases in his hands.\n[1969-08-15 14:01:10] Rocky path | I saw the mother wearing a beige coat, her long hair covered by a pale blue headscarf, one hand pushing a stroller and the other holding a little boy’s hand.\n[1969-08-15 14:01:20] Rocky path | I saw the bus continue forward, kicking up a large cloud of gray exhaust on the road. I heard the father say: 'We still have a way to go.'\n[1969-08-15 14:01:30] Rocky path | I saw the mother look down at the boy, and he nodded. I heard the mother say: 'Are you okay, Henrik Inge?'\n[1969-08-15 14:01:35] Rocky path | I heard him say: 'I'm fine.'\n[1969-08-15 14:01:40] Rocky path | I noticed he was about four and a half years old, with hair so light it was almost white, and skin tanned brown from the long summer sun.\n[1969-08-15 14:01:45] Rocky path | I saw his younger brother, the infant not yet eight months old, lying in the stroller gazing at the sky. I thought that at this moment, he neither knew where he was nor where he was going.\n[1969-08-15 14:02:00] slope path | I watched as they began slowly walking up the slope path.\n[1969-08-15 14:02:10] gravel road | Before me lay a gravel road scattered with stones. On both sides stretched open fields, and about five hundred meters ahead was a forest of low trees, seemingly stunted by years of sea winds, extending all the way to the pebble beach.\n[1969-08-15 14:02:30] gravel road | I saw a newly built house standing to the right; otherwise, no other buildings were visible around.\n[1969-08-15 14:03:00] gravel road | I watched the baby gradually close its eyes and fall asleep amid the gentle rocking. A sharp creaking sound from the carriage’s large spring frame rang in my ears.\n[1969-08-15 14:03:15] gravel road | I saw my father put down a box he was carrying and wipe sweat from his forehead. His closely cropped dark hair and thick black beard stood out distinctly.\n[1969-08-15 14:03:20] gravel road | I heard him say, \"What a stifling hot day.\"\n[1969-08-15 14:03:25] gravel road | I heard her reply, \"Yes, but it might be cooler further toward the sea.\"\n[1969-08-15 14:03:30] gravel road | I saw him pick up the box again. I heard him say, \"Let's hope so.\"\n[1969-08-15 14:04:00] Rocky | I knew this was an ordinary family. They had just moved here from Bærum, where they had lived for five years. As far as I knew, Rocky was having a house built for them, and during the interim, they were renting an old house outside the former Høver barracks.\n[1969-08-15 14:04:10] Rocky | I learned that while in Bærum, he studied English and Leivik during the day and worked night shifts; meanwhile, she attended nursing school at Ullenvold Hospital. I knew he had secured a teaching position, and she worked as a nurse at a care facility.\n[1969-08-15 14:04:20] Vesfjord / West Leivik | As far as I know, they met at seventeen and married at twenty. I learned that his relatives did not attend the wedding in West Leivik. Looking at the photo, at his smile surrounded by solitude, I realize he didn't fully belong to her social circle.\n[1969-08-15 14:04:30] Rocky | I think, now they are twenty-four, and life lies ahead of them. They have their own jobs, house, and child—the future belongs entirely to them.\n[1969-08-15 14:04:35] Rocky | I wonder in my heart—wasn’t it so?\n[1969-08-15 14:04:40] Leivik | I know they were both born in 1944. I understand the 1950s was a period of rebuilding, when various social systems began developing, and this generation was finding their place in an emerging society.\n[1969-08-15 14:04:50] Outer Sogn South Berlevåg / Jølster | As far as I know, her father came from a farm in South Berlevåg, and her grandfather from a small island overseas. I learned her mother came from a farm in Jølster, where her family's presence can be traced back to the sixteenth century.\n[1969-08-15 14:05:00] Vesfjord / Aust-Agder | I know his relatives belonged to a higher social class and had received higher education. From what I’ve heard, his mother came from Aust-Agder, and her father was a sea captain. She followed her husband to Vesfjord—a common way of life at the time.\n[1969-08-15 14:05:10] Leivik | I learned that during the 1950s and 60s, a transformation known as the 'spirit of the age' took place—children of fishermen and workers began pursuing higher education, becoming teachers or psychologists, and settling far from their families.\n[1969-08-15 14:05:20] Leivik | I understand that the spirit of the age affected everyone differently. I imagine for that young mother, spending her whole life on the farm must have seemed absurd—she must have strongly desired to leave and have a life entirely her own.\n[1969-08-15 14:05:30] Leivik / United States | I know there was no tradition of leaving home in her family; the only one who went far away was her father’s brother Magnus, who emigrated to the United States due to poverty. Yet I find that, like many families across the country, her siblings held a firm belief in leaving their hometown.\n[1969-08-15 14:05:40] South of Leivik | I understand his situation was completely different—his family expected him to pursue better education, not to marry a farmer’s daughter and settle in a southern residential area.\n[1969-08-15 14:06:00] on the way to the new house | I watched them walking down the path to their new home. Father dragged a heavy crate filled with sixties clothing, mother pushed a lace-decorated baby stroller, and eldest son Henrik Inge happily darted between them, brimming with hope for the future.\n[1969-08-15 14:07:00] rental housing area | I watched them pass through the woods and enter this rental housing area. I noticed a gas repair station on the right, and to the left, a large red military barracks surrounded by gravel; beyond it lay a dense pine forest.\n[1969-08-15 14:08:00] Rocky Church / Meld Island | About one kilometer to the east, I could see the elevated stone church. The area around it was dotted with exotic flowers, and fossils were buried among the pebble beaches. I knew that Rocky Church was built in 1150. As far as I knew, Meld Island bore witness to the region’s glorious trading history. I learned that Rocky was the first place in the country where potatoes were planted, and Stone Age weapons lay hidden beneath the meadows.\n[1969-08-15 14:09:00] rental housing area | I watched this moving family slowly cross the open land. I noticed that the marks left on this land weren’t ancient ones, but traces from World War II.\n[1969-08-15 14:09:30] rental housing area | I knew this area had been occupied by Oswick forces during the war. I understood there were low brick bunkers standing in the woods, artillery emplacements once stood at the highest cliff points, and even a small airfield existed here.\n[1969-08-15 14:10:00] red house | I saw a detached house painted red with white window frames. I smelled the scent of the forest and sea salt, and could hear the rhythmic sound of waves from hundreds of meters away.\n[1969-08-15 14:11:00] red house | I saw father put down the crate and find the key to unlock the door. Inside, I saw a hallway, kitchen, living room with a wood stove, and three bedrooms.\n[1969-08-15 14:11:30] red house | I noticed the walls of the house lacked insulation, and the kitchen appliances were basic. There was no telephone, dishwasher, washing machine, or television.\n[1969-08-15 14:12:00] red house | I saw father carry the crate into the bedroom, Henrik Inge running back and forth between the windows looking out, and mother parking the stroller on the stone steps outside the door. I heard father say: \"We’re here.\"",

    "text": "[1969-12-15 10:00:00] Hofver House | I learned that winter’s snow was several meters deep. From photographs, I saw Henrik Inge pushing me in the stroller, standing on short skis and smiling at the camera.\n[1970-01-15 10:00:00] Hofe House interior | I saw him smiling at me in the photograph, or myself standing alone by the crib. I remember the first sound I ever made was 'Ao-wu,' calling for him.\n[1970-06-15 10:00:00] Hofe House | I heard he was the only one who could understand what I said. I also knew he had gone door to door asking if there were any children for me to play with—Grandmother often delighted in telling this story.\n[1970-07-15 10:00:00] Tibaken Construction Area | I knew the neighbors here came from all over the country. Families like the Magnuses, Presbakkmos, and Kanestroms lived here with their children. By now, I began to lose track of their parents and occupations.\n[1970-07-15 10:00:10] Tibaken Construction Area | I knew the names of a group of kids like Bent and Erik Jens. As far as I knew, most were around my age, and five of them later became my classmates.\n[1970-07-15 10:00:20] Tibaken Construction Area | I knew we moved here in the summer of 1970, when most of the houses were still under construction.\n[1970-07-15 10:00:30] Tibaken Construction Area | The sharp, piercing alarm before each blast and the tremor through the floor afterward were the most ordinary experiences of my childhood. That trembling always gave me a peculiar sensation, as if the end of the world had arrived.\n[1970-07-15 10:01:00] Construction Site | My friends and I gathered around the excavated cavern, peering deep into it. Before my eyes were various gashes in the earth—beneath lay yellow sand, black mud, and gray clay, often covered at the bottom with murky standing water. I found that these excavated gashes held a special attraction for me and the children growing up with me.\n[1970-07-15 10:01:10] Construction Site | Above the pit, I saw the yellow excavator resembling a long-necked bird, the headlights of the truck like eyes, and the radiator grille like an open mouth.\n[1970-07-15 10:01:20] Construction Site | I saw the massive tire tracks left by bulldozers on the ground, as wide as our palms.\n[1970-07-15 10:01:30] Construction Site | If I was lucky, I would take away the tangled wires near the blast hole. I believed those wires were valuable things, useful both in trading and practical use.\n[1970-07-15 10:01:40] construction site | I noticed tall cable spools scattered around, about my height, along with wooden drums and smooth brownish-red plastic pipes nearly as thick as my forearm. Piles of concrete pipes and precast concrete wells looked rugged yet beautiful, their height just right for us to climb.\n[1970-07-15 10:01:50] construction site | I saw old tires fastened into long strips, meant for people to use during explosions. Stacks of wooden telephone poles, soaked in preservative, had turned green. Nearby were boxes of explosives and a shelter where workers ate.\n[1970-07-15 10:02:00] construction site | I saw the workers laboring, and my friends and I kept a respectful distance, watching them intently.\n[1970-07-15 10:03:00] construction site | When the workers were away, I climbed into the excavation pit, jumped onto the wheels of a dump trailer, walked along the pipes testing my balance. I poked around, peered through windows into the sheds, climbed into concrete wells, and tried pushing the cable spools. I collected scraps of wire, plastic handles, and leads, stuffing them all into my pockets.\n[1970-07-15 10:04:00] construction site | I watched the workers in orange coveralls or baggy blue work pants, noticing how they'd pull combs from their pockets to comb their hair.\n[1970-07-15 10:05:00] construction site | I saw them tuck their helmets under their arms, moving through the roar of machinery. In the afternoon, I witnessed the magical moment: they emerged from the work shed, changed into ordinary clothes, got into their cars, and drove off like regular people. I felt that moment was almost incomprehensible.\n[1970-07-15 10:06:00] construction site | I remained wide awake, closely observing the movements of the other workers.\n[1970-07-15 10:07:00] beside a telephone pole | I noticed workers from the telecommunications company appearing nearby, and the news quickly spread among the children. I saw a car parked there and an engineer standing by. I thought his climbing shoes for scaling poles were absolutely amazing!\n[1970-07-15 10:07:10] beside a telephone pole | I observed him putting on the shoes, strapping a tool bag around his waist, securing the safety clip to the pole, then beginning his ascent with slow, confident motions. Those climbing movements seemed extremely complex and incomprehensible to me.\n[1970-07-15 10:07:30] beside a telephone pole | I saw him straighten his back and swiftly climb to the top without any apparent effort. I wondered how this could be possible? He didn't seem under any strain at all.\n[1970-07-15 10:08:00] beside the utility pole | I stared wide-eyed at him as he worked on the utility pole.\n[1970-07-15 10:09:00] beside the utility pole | I saw him climb down quickly from above, moving with ease and effortlessness. I thought that with those shoes and that curved metal rod, there was nothing he couldn't do climbing up and down the pole. I realized I didn't need to worry about him at all.\n[1970-07-15 10:10:00] storm drain opening | I saw the workers at the storm drain park their vehicle by the roadside. I noticed they put on tall boots reaching up to their waists, used iron rods to pry open the heavy circular iron cover, and then climbed down through the opening. I found that some of these drain openings were beside sidewalks, others situated high up on concrete structures.\n[1970-07-15 10:10:30] storm drain opening | I watched as their feet, thighs, torsos, and finally heads disappeared one by one into the opening. I wondered silently in my mind: What exactly is down there? Is it a tunnel?\n[1970-07-15 10:11:00] storm drain opening | I heard them call out for us to stay away as they climbed down to work. I realized this was something nobody knew. I felt that no one dared to go and ask them.\n[1970-08-15 10:00:00] Hoff house steps | I know I once fell from the outdoor steps, so frightened I couldn't catch my breath. As far as I know, Mom rushed me to the neighbor's house, holding me tightly in her arms. I learned she thought it was an epileptic seizure, but actually it was nothing at all.\n[1971-05-15 10:00:00] the mountain peak | I know Dad loved teaching and was a talented psychologist. I’ve seen photos of him leading students up to the mountain peak; in those early seventies images, he looked very young and happy.\n[1971-05-15 10:00:10] the mountain peak | From the photos, I saw them wearing hand-knitted sweaters, loose pants, and rubber boots. I know that was the typical style of the era, their hair fluffy and soft, falling over their cheeks.\n[1971-05-15 10:00:20] the mountain peak | I once heard Mom say that perhaps this was the happiest time in Dad’s life.\n[1972-10-15 10:00:00] Vesfjord balcony | I saw the photo at Grandma’s. It showed Henrik Inge and me in knitted sweaters, together on the balcony. I saw Grandma’s face pressed close to mine under the clear blue autumn sky. I know I must have been only two or three years old in that picture.\n[1973-06-15 14:00:00] wooden bridge in sparse woods | I stood on the wooden bridge at the center of the sparse woods, watching the rushing stream flow beneath me. I bounced up and down, making the bridge sway and wobble, and couldn't help but burst into laughter. I felt the green and white water gushing below me. I know that back then, my thoughts were all about meaningless little things.\n[1973-06-15 14:00:10] wooden bridge in sparse woods | I saw my neighbor Nils Lidar standing beside me, bouncing up and down too, laughing heartily. I know he was standing right beside me at that moment.",

    "text": "[1973-08-15 10:00:00] Mjøndalen crossroads | I sat in the back seat as the car stopped at the crossroads. I saw Dad turn around. I heard Dad say, 'We've arrived in Mjøndalen.' I heard them tell me we were going to a match. I know it was to watch a game by Stato club, but I can't remember exactly which one.\n[1973-09-15 10:00:00] hillside outside the house | I climbed the hillside outside the house, pushing the large yellow-and-red plastic freight wagon. I remember the delight this wagon once brought me. I felt an immense joy connected with wealth, luck, and happiness.\n[1973-10-15 20:00:00] bedroom | I heard Henrik Inge say from the upper bunk, 'I'm a fox, and now I'm going to catch you.' I know I was so afraid of foxes. I remember screaming in fear when he said that.\n[1973-10-15 20:00:10] bedroom | I saw him lean down from the upper bunk and reach out to grab me. I shouted at him, 'No, you're not a fox.' I heard him say, 'Yes, I am.'\n[1973-10-15 20:01:00] bedroom | I heard myself ask him, 'Henrik Inge, are you scared now?'\n[1973-10-15 20:01:10] bedroom | I heard him reply, 'No, why should I be scared? There's nothing to be afraid of here.' I realized he was right, marveled inwardly, and my heart grew calm.\n[1974-05-15 15:00:00] slope below Helen Ster's house | I saw it come charging down the slope after me. When I saw it drawing closer, I immediately froze in place. I knew Trude had loosened its collar because she was wearing high heels. I'd heard that one should act indifferent when facing a wild animal, so I followed that advice.\n[1974-05-15 15:00:10] slope below Helen Ster's house | I saw the dog open its mouth and bite down hard on my arm. I realized freezing still had been no help at all. I knew the wound was just beside my wrist joint.\n[1974-05-15 15:00:30] Below Helen Ster's house | I saw Trude rush over and grab the collar, pulling it back with all her strength. I kept walking quickly forward, crying. I knew it was finally pulled back.\n[1974-06-15 10:00:00] Tibaken construction area | I knew we were free before school started. As far as I knew, there were only two exceptions.\n[1974-06-15 10:00:10] Main road | I knew the first forbidden area was the main road from the bridge all the way to the gas station.\n[1974-06-15 10:00:20] Lakeside | I heard adults emphasize: \"Never go to the lake alone!\" I knew the second forbidden area was the lakeside.\n[1974-06-15 10:01:00] Lakeside meadow | I sat on the hillside beside the meadow, gazing at the lake. I heard someone say: Down below, beneath the steep cliff, lives the water spirit—it will catch children. I remember sometimes we played football on that little meadow.\n[1974-06-15 10:01:10] Lakeside meadow | I heard my friends talking: \"Who said that?\" \"Mom and Dad.\" \"Right here?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1974-06-15 10:01:20] Yttervika cliff | I stared down at the gray water below. I saw the dark, rippling water of Yttervika. I thought: It really looks like it might be true—I felt as if something truly was down there beneath the surface.\n[1974-06-15 10:01:30] Yttervika cliff | I heard one of my friends ask: \"Only here? Then we can go somewhere else, like Tyena?\"\n[1974-06-15 10:01:40] Yttervika cliff | I heard someone reply: \"Or Little Hawaii? There are different water spirits there. They're dangerous—they drag children into the water and drown them.\"\n[1974-06-15 10:01:50] Yttervika cliff | I heard a worried voice from a companion: \"Could it come up here?\" I also heard the negative answer: \"I don't think so—it's too far.\"\n[1974-09-15 20:00:00] new room | I miss him. Even though he used to scare me often, I still feel lonely now that I have to sleep alone in my own room.\n[1974-09-15 20:00:10] new room | I look at this new room. I think it's nice here, but it's still not as good as when we were together, sleeping on the top bunk.\n[1975-01-15 10:00:00] outside Beck's house | I see stacks of firewood placed under a tarp outside Beck's house. In winter, I also see them stored beneath an overturned wooden boat.\n[1975-05-01 10:00:00] home | I see Dad hand me a knife during the ceremony. I use it to cut, whittle, and play with other kids. I hear Dad say they're proud of me. I know that at first all the children had knives except me. I notice the boy in the knife sheath is wearing a skirt. I hide my disappointment about this 'girl's' knife deep inside. I think as long as no one sees the details of the sheath, it will be fine—and eventually, my affection for the knife wins out.\n[1975-05-15 10:00:00] Tibaken | I think by the time I was seven, I was no longer afraid of foxes. But I realize that the space left behind was immediately filled with new fears.\n[1975-05-15 10:00:00] school | I know that in spring we went to school, met our homeroom teacher, and drew pictures. But I realize it was completely different from the very first day of school. I silently reflect: the first day of school isn't just symbolic—it's real.\n[1975-05-15 10:01:00] in front of the TV | I pass by the television in the morning. I see the TV is on, and on the screen a headless person is walking up the stairs.\n[1975-05-15 10:01:10] room | I scream and dash into the room. I frantically search for Mom or my brother. Though the sun shines brightly outside and birds are singing, it brings me no comfort. I think I am utterly helpless on my own. I feel the image of the headless man chasing me, even in broad daylight. I realize my heart is pounding violently and fear surging through my nerves.\n[1975-05-15 14:00:00] construction site | Toya Moen and I carve wooden swords. We hold them and wander through the construction site, sneaking behind two girls pushing toy baby carriages. We repeatedly slash at their canvas hoods, making them scream. Later, we keep watching them closely. I hear them say they’re going to tell on us. I think we are pirates, and they are pirate ships. I realize we begin to feel afraid ourselves.\n[1975-05-15 16:00:00] the woods atop the hill | I see them walking toward my house and the Moens’ house. Frightened, we climb up the hill and slip deep into the woods at the summit, going all the way to the cliff’s edge. I know this is a place Toya Moen and I have never been to before. After analyzing the situation, I feel terrified and decide to flee from home. I think we can spend the night here and keep going tomorrow.\n[1975-05-15 19:00:00] cliff edge | I sat with Toya Moen at the cliff edge for about half an hour, and in the end I followed him back. I saw the sun hanging low behind me, and everything bathed in golden light under its rays. I wanted to persuade him to stay, but he insisted on going home for dinner, and I was afraid of the dark, too scared to remain outside alone.\n[1975-05-15 20:00:00] home | I saw my father waiting for me in the garden; he grabbed my arm, dragged me upstairs, locked me in my room, and took away my knife. I sat inside watching Toya Moen playing outside. I heard my father say while looking at the hole in the sheath: \"Look at this sheath—it's completely ruined.\" I thought they didn't understand the difference between a knife and a sword at all. I damaged the sheath only to hide the pattern on it. I realized that after getting a slap, Toya Moen was fine—he didn't care at all.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:00] Kanestrøm hill | I noticed that the Kanestrøms had a golden retriever named Alex, with gentle eyes and a friendly posture. Even though he looked as tame as a sheep, I still felt deeply afraid inside.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:00] Beck's house | I knew their two older sisters, who were in middle school, used to take care of us. I learned that their younger brother Helen Ster wore strange clothes and showed no interest in the things we cared about.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:00] Tibaken | I remembered my father once showed me a detective magazine whose cover featured a skeleton. I saw that skull turned around, staring at me with hollow red eyes, and I began fearing it might suddenly appear before me without warning.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:10] Kanestrøm hill | When I appeared on the hill, ready to press the doorbell, I immediately froze in place. I heard the dog emit a powerful, deep, and loud bark - nothing like a friendly sound.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:10] Beck's house | I learned that he built a real boat when he was twelve. I knew he wasn't one of us—we were separated by a great distance.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:20] Kanestrøm hill | If no one was around, I would try greeting it by saying: \"Hey, Alex, I'm not afraid, you know. Not afraid at all.\"",

    "text": "[1975-06-15 10:00:20] Beck's house | I knew his father once dreamed of living alone in the woods. I understood that when the first construction machine parked beside their home, he must have felt deeply disappointed.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:30] Kanestrøm hill | I pretended to walk past casually, and when it opened its mouth to snarl, I bent down and patted it briefly on the side. I could feel my heart pounding violently in my chest, and my entire body went weak from fear.\n[1975-06-15 10:00:40] up the slope to the Kanestrom house | I saw Dalson running up from the gravel path, or coming out through the front door. I heard Dalson shout, \"Stop barking, Alex!\"\n[1975-06-15 10:00:45] up the slope to the Kanestrom house | I heard him say, \"Grete Lundnes is afraid of dogs barking, you fool.\"\n[1975-06-15 10:00:50] up the slope to the Kanestrom house | I watched Dalson staring at me with a stiff smile. I retorted, \"I'm not afraid.\" I realized his smile meant I didn't need to try acting brave.\n[1975-06-15 10:01:00] on the road | So we set off together.\n[1975-06-15 10:01:00] bathroom | I heard the sharp, grating sound from the pipes when the hot water tap in the bathroom was turned on, followed by violent banging. Those sharp, grating sounds filled me with intense fear and unease.\n[1975-06-15 10:01:10] bathroom | I knew the others in the house would always run cold water first to draw out the hot water gradually and avoid the noise.\n[1975-06-15 10:01:20] bathroom | I tried to turn off the tap as quickly as possible and ran out. I heard that piercing, grating noise and rapid pounding penetrating through the entire wall. I felt as if something beneath was going mad; I was completely seized by fear.\n[1975-06-15 10:01:30] bathroom | In the morning, I either used cold water or continued with the lukewarm water left by Henrik Inge. I knew the water wasn't clean, but at least it was gentle.\n[1975-06-15 10:02:00] various places around Rocky | We wandered everywhere—into the woods, to Ytterfjord, the dry dock, Rocky Bridge, Old Tibaken, the shipbuilding factory, up the hills, to Lake Tjenna, the supermarket, or the gas station.\n[1975-06-15 10:03:00] the road near our homes | If we didn’t go far, we’d run along the road near our houses, gather outside someone’s doorway, sit on stone steps, or climb up into the thick cherry trees.\n[1975-07-15 10:00:00] Childhood Lane | I saw the coarse gravel on Childhood Lane, which under the summer sun almost appeared blue.\n[1975-07-15 10:00:00] Spunes Beach | I preferred to stay near Spunes Beach, wading in the water, going as deep as I wanted. I knew that on good weather days we often parked the car at the old shooting range and walked down to the rocky area below—it was our usual spot.\n[1975-07-15 10:00:10] North Hill Loop / Deer Path | I walked along the gravel road, following the brown fence, through a low ditch between North Hill Loop and Deer Path. I saw various cars from the seventies parked along the driveway—Citroëns, Fords, Volvos. That ditch ran through the entire area.\n[1975-07-15 10:00:20] Hill leading to the woods | I saw the dark, fertile hillsides rising on both sides of the road toward the woods, where slender green shoots were bursting vigorously out of the soil. I noticed how these thin stems would multiply wildly over the next year, until they covered the entire hillside.\n[1975-07-15 10:00:30] Hill leading to the woods | I saw young trees, foxgloves, and ferns blurring the once-clear boundary between the road and the forest.\n[1975-07-15 10:00:40] Sidewalk stone curb | I saw tiny streams flowing down the narrow stone curbs of the sidewalk when it rained.\n[1975-07-15 10:01:00] Badger Road | I saw a small marsh beside the path leading to the supermarket, shaded by birch trees. Olson’s house stood at the highest point of the slope known as 'Badger Road'.\n[1975-07-15 10:01:10] Helen Ster and Trude's house | I saw that the first house on the left belonged to Helen Ster and Trude—the plot of land more like a stony field. Every time I passed this house, I always felt terrified.\n[1975-07-15 10:01:20] Helen Ster and Trude's house | I knew Helen Ster might throw things at children passing by, and I remembered they had an Oswick sheepdog. I realized why I felt afraid, silently cursing that creature as a damned beast.\n[1975-07-15 10:01:30] Helen Ster and Trude's house | I saw it tethered to the balcony or driveway, pacing within the length of its rope, barking furiously at passersby. I saw its lean body, yellowish eyes that looked sickly, and heard its constant growling near my ears.\n[1975-07-15 10:05:00] beside the rock | I saw small pools of water gathered by the rock, their bottoms covered with barnacles and kelp. When waves struck the rock, water surged up to my neck, and the thunderous sound of water hitting stone filled my ears. I felt how the steep rocky walls around me amplified the sounds, making it seem as if I were inside a deep cave.\n[1975-07-15 10:06:00] beside the rock | I stood there trembling, gasping for breath. I heard the hissing sound of seawater retreating. I felt terrified—suddenly my breathing became labored, and that sound filled me with fear and unease.\n[1975-07-15 10:10:00] shore | I lay on an inflated swimming raft, floating along the shore, gently moving my hands through the water. I felt the soaked plastic clinging to my skin, my back scorched by the blazing sun, and splashes of water all around.\n[1975-07-15 10:15:00] shore | I scanned the water with my eyes, looking for fish or crabs, following distant moving boats. I smelled the salty freshness of the sea and saw the kelp on the rocks swaying slowly like waves.\n[1975-07-15 14:00:00] outside the bay | I saw a huge white ferry appear on the horizon, docking between the reefs outside the bay. I saw many children come swimming as the ferry passed by. I knew children from the southwest side of the island would be drawn here by the powerful waves churned up by the ship’s wake.\n[1975-07-15 14:30:00] at sea | I was paddling on my raft when suddenly a wave hurled me into the air, then threw me back into the water.\n[1975-07-15 14:30:20] underwater/at sea | I sank like a stone about three meters down, flailing wildly with arms and legs, crying out for help. I accidentally swallowed several mouthfuls of seawater. I felt extreme panic—thankfully Dad saw everything.\n[1975-07-15 14:31:00] land | Dad dove into the water and pulled me up, dragging me back onto land. I spat out some water, then followed everyone home. I felt a chill running through my body.\n[1975-07-15 15:00:00] home | I climbed up the hill to tell Karl Larsdal everything that had happened. I realized the world is some kind of solid, impenetrable surface. I suppose I’ve always known this fact, but only now truly felt that we are walking upon a surface.\n[1975-07-15 15:10:00] seaside | I sat on a towel beside Henrik Inge, watching the distant lighthouse and the moving ships. I saw the pale blue sea, smooth as a mirror, and the white lighthouse at the horizon standing clearly against the azure sky. Despite the drowning incident, I still looked forward to these trips to the seaside, finding the view truly delightful.\n[1975-07-15 15:20:00] seaside | I drank juice and ate biscuits, my eyes following Dad as he walked to the edge of the hilltop and jumped into the two-meter-deep seawater. I saw him emerge from the water, shaking his head to shake off the droplets. I heard the noisy splashing of water. I saw Dad’s brown skin and well-developed muscles.\n[1975-07-15 15:30:00] in the sea | I watched Dad swim further out to sea, his body rising and falling in the water. I noticed his strokes were heavy and slow, and a rare joy appeared in his eyes.",

    "text": "[1975-07-15 15:40:00] a pit by the seaside | I saw two pits on the rocks—one filled with broad seaweed, deep enough to reveal spiral markings; the other shallower, full of extremely salty, warm water covered with tiny insects and sickly algae. I found this natural scenery between the rocks incredibly beautiful.\n[1975-07-15 16:00:00] by the water | I followed Dad to the water’s edge, standing in about half a meter of water. I saw him swim to the reef four or five meters from shore, then turn around and look at me. I heard Dad shout: “Now swim over to me.” I saw smooth blades of seaweed floating on the water surface.\n[1975-07-15 16:00:10] by the water | I looked down at the bottom and noticed the reef faintly visible in the depths. I shouted loudly: “The water is too deep!” I realized the water there might be three meters deep.\n[1975-07-15 16:00:20] by the water | I heard Dad say: “I’m right here, Grete Lundnes. If you sink, would I not save you? Swim—start now. Dive into the water, move your arms.” I sensed his firm belief that I could do it—if only I tried, I would learn how to swim.\n[1975-07-15 16:01:00] by the water | I squatted down in the water. I saw the seabed shimmering with a faint green glow deep below. I hesitated inwardly: Could I really float and move forward on this water?\n[1975-07-15 16:01:10] by the water | I screamed desperately: “I can’t!” I felt my heart pounding violently in my chest from fear.\n[1975-07-15 16:01:20] by the water | I heard Dad shout back: “You can! It’s not hard!” But I still insisted: “I can’t!”\n[1975-07-15 16:02:00] by the water | I watched him sigh, then swim back toward me. I heard him say: “OK, I’ll swim beside you. I can support your belly from underneath so you won’t sink!”\n[1975-07-15 16:02:10] by the water | I started crying, repeating over and over that I couldn't do it. I sobbed to him, \"I can't.\" I thought I really couldn't—why didn't he understand that?\n[1975-07-15 16:02:20] by the water | I felt as if my head, chest, arms, legs, even my fingers and toes, were all filled with deep water. I was completely surrounded by the sensation of deep water, and I desperately wished I could cast this feeling aside and stop thinking about it.\n[1975-07-15 16:05:00] on shore | I saw Dad walk up onto the shore with a stern face, heading toward where we had left our things, and when he came back, he was holding my life jacket. I noticed that Dad’s smiling face from earlier was gone.\n[1975-07-15 16:06:00] by the water | I saw Dad throw the life jacket to me. He swam out again and turned around to face me. I put on the life jacket. I heard him say, \"There, put this on. Now you won’t be able to sink even if you try. Start swimming! Swim to me!\" Even though I had the life jacket on, I knew deep down it wouldn’t help—it wouldn’t change anything.\n[1975-07-15 16:07:00] by the water | I crouched down and stretched my arms forward beneath the water. I heard Dad encouraging me: \"Yes, that's right!\" I felt cool water rushing against my swim trunks.\n[1975-07-15 16:07:10] by the water | I thought all I needed to do was lean forward, dive into the sea, and take a few strokes—but I just couldn't do it. I realized that no matter what, I would never be able to move forward through this deep water.\n[1975-07-15 16:08:00] by the water | I felt tears running down my cheeks. I heard Dad shout loudly, \"Come on, now—right now, kid! We can't spend all day on this!\"\n[1975-07-15 16:08:10] by the water | I shouted back as hard as I could, \"I can't do it! Can you hear me?\"\n[1975-07-15 16:08:20] by the water | I stared into his eyes; his expression turned ugly. I heard him ask me furiously, \"Are you determined to defy me?\" I saw his face stiffen and realized he had become utterly enraged.\n[1975-07-15 16:08:30] by the water | I couldn't stop sobbing, and I felt my arms trembling violently. I whispered, \"No.\"\n[1975-07-15 16:09:00] by the water | I saw him swim back, grab my arm tightly, and try to pull me into the water. I twisted my body desperately toward the land. I heard him command: \"Come here.\" I shouted in refusal: \"I won't!\"\n[1975-07-15 16:10:00] by the water | I saw him let go of my arm and sigh deeply. I heard him say resignedly: \"Alright then, we know now.\"\n[1975-07-15 16:15:00] on shore | I watched him walk over to where our things were. I took off my life jacket and followed, stopping a few meters behind him. I saw him rub his face, underarms, and thighs with a towel, then put on his shirt, buttoning it as he looked out ahead. Before me lay the remarkably calm sea.\n[1975-07-15 16:20:00] on shore | I watched him pull on his socks and slip his feet into his shoes. Without turning around, he asked me: \"What are you still waiting for?\" I noticed he was wearing brown leather shoes without laces, which didn’t match at all with his socks and swimming trunks.\n[1975-07-15 16:25:00] on the way back to the car | I pulled my T-shirt over my head and put on my running shoes, tying the laces. I saw Dad pack the empty juice bottles and orange peels into the cooler bag, sling it over his shoulder, and walk off with a damp towel clutched in his other hand. He didn’t say a word on the way back to the car. The light blue Lars Palmas T-shirt I was wearing had been a gift from my grandparents.\n[1975-07-15 16:30:00] parking lot | I watched him open the trunk, put the cooler bag inside, and take my life jacket. I was still holding a wet towel in my hand, but he ignored it. I realized he clearly hadn’t thought about my towel, and I certainly wouldn’t bother him with something so trivial at this moment.\n[1975-07-15 16:31:00] inside the car | I got into the car and, to avoid drawing attention, pressed my palms flat against the seat beneath my thighs, tucking my hands as far in as possible. Although the car was parked in the shade, the black seats were scorching hot. I felt sharp stings on my thighs. For a moment I hesitated about placing the wet towel underneath, but I guessed he would surely notice.\n[1975-07-15 16:35:00] inside the car | I sat in the slowly moving car, feeling the bumps in the road. I saw green branches and bushes brush across the roof. The car was driving across an open gravel field called the Shooting Range, scattered with large stones and deep holes. Now and then, I heard small thuds as branches tapped against the roof.\n[1975-07-15 16:40:00] inside the car | I quickly glanced at his face in the rearview mirror—he showed no expression. My palms still burned with pain. It suddenly occurred to me that Dad was also sitting only in his swim shorts on the hot seat, yet he managed to give no sign that his thighs were being stung.\n[1975-07-15 16:50:00] main road | I felt the car accelerate sharply. During the final five kilometers home, he drove very fast. The car passed along the main road below the church. I noticed he was driving well above the speed limit.\n[1975-07-15 18:00:00] at home | That afternoon, I heard him tell Mom, 'He has hydrophobia.' I knew that wasn't true, but I said nothing—I wasn't stupid enough to speak up.\n[1975-07-22 10:00:00] Tibaken | As far as I knew, my grandparents were coming to visit us at Tibaken a week later—it was their first time seeing us here.\n[1975-07-22 10:00:10] Southberge Farm | I knew they had lived very comfortably on the farm at Southberge. Grandpa always wore overalls and tall boots, and liked to spit tobacco juice on the ground; Grandma wore clean old dresses, and her hands were always slightly trembling.\n[1975-07-22 10:10:00] driveway | I saw my grandparents step out of the car, which had just pulled up onto the driveway in front of our house. I realized immediately that they looked completely out of place here.",

    "text": "[1975-07-22 10:15:00] garden | I showed them around the garden and saw Grandpa pointing here and there with the stem of his pipe. Grandpa was wearing a well-tailored gray suit and a gray hat, Grandma a light gray coat and carrying a handbag. I knew no one around here dressed like that.\n[1975-07-22 10:20:00] room | I realized that even in the city, nobody dressed the way they did. I felt as if they had stepped out of another era. A sense of strangeness filled our room.\n[1975-07-22 10:30:00] at home | I noticed that sometimes when Dad passed by me or my brother, he would rest a hand briefly on our shoulders. I found that my parents’ attitude had suddenly changed—Dad had actually become friendly, even saying things like 'Why not?' It felt as though we were celebrating Christmas.\n[1975-07-22 10:40:00] at home | I observed that whenever Dad talked with Grandma, he would briefly look away. I sensed that Dad was actually uninterested—his eyes were dull and distant. Grandpa, though lively and animated, seemed less secure here, and didn’t notice Dad’s distraction.\n[1975-07-23 19:00:00] dining room | I learned that one evening, Dad bought crabs to treat them. I knew it wasn’t even crab season, but for him this was a proper feast.\n[1975-07-23 19:10:00] dining room | I heard Dad say it as a joke. He said that if Grandpa ever caught crabs, he’d throw them back into the sea. I knew my grandparents wouldn’t eat crabs because, according to their superstition, crabs weren’t clean—they believed this because crabs fed on dead things at the bottom of the sea. I wondered silently—had these crabs really been eating corpses at the bottom of the Skagerrak?\n[1975-07-24 15:00:00] garden | I went back to my room and lay down reading comic books. I heard my grandparents walking onto the balcony; we had just finished drinking coffee in the garden.\n[1975-07-24 15:10:00] living room/bedroom | I heard their heavy footsteps on the stairs, and then they walked into the living room. I saw the evening sun resting on the wall of the room, casting a golden glow. There was not a word spoken in the living room.\n[1975-07-24 15:20:00] bedroom | I gazed through the window at the street, houses, and various objects outside. I saw the outdoor lawn covered in varying shades of brownish-tan. The entire residential area appeared profoundly quiet. To me, it all seemed as if everything was asleep.\n[1975-07-24 15:30:00] living room | I stood up and walked into the living room, where I saw my grandparents each sitting in their chairs. I asked them, \"Do you want to watch TV?\" I felt my sweaty chest stick to the bedsheet, that sticky sensation making me uncomfortable.\n[1975-07-24 15:30:10] living room | I heard my grandfather say happily, \"Sure! Is the news about to start? You know, we’re interested in that.\"\n[1975-07-24 15:31:00] living room | I walked over and turned on the television. Then I stepped back. I saw light appear on the screen, the news logo gradually enlarging. In my ears rang the monotonous xylophone music, starting softly and growing heavier.\n[1975-07-24 15:31:10] living room | I saw my grandfather hunched forward in his chair, gripping the stem of his pipe. I said to them, \"It's on.\"\n[1975-07-24 15:31:20] living room | I knew I wasn't usually allowed to turn on the TV or radio by myself. But this time, since it was for my grandparents, I figured Dad wouldn’t have anything to say about it.\n[1975-07-24 15:32:00] living room | I saw the images on the screen rapidly rolling and colors distorting, then a flash accompanied by a dull boom—the entire screen went black.\n[1975-07-24 15:32:10] living room | I stood there, my eyes filled with tears. I heard my grandfather ask, \"What's wrong with the TV?\" I cried and answered, \"It's broken.\" I thought: Oh no. No, no, no.\n[1975-07-24 15:32:20] living room | I realized I was the one who had broken the TV.\n[1975-07-24 15:33:00] living room | I saw Grandpa get up and shuffle slowly toward the radio. I heard Grandpa comfort me, saying, 'These things happen anytime. Actually, I prefer listening to the news on the radio.'\n[1975-07-24 15:35:00] bedroom | I walked back to my room and lay down on the bed. I felt the cool bedsheet against my warm skin. I shivered with fear. I felt a churning in my stomach.\n[1975-07-24 15:40:00] bedroom | I picked up a magazine from the floor. I couldn't focus on reading at all. I kept thinking about how Dad would soon come into the room to turn on the TV, and anxiety filled me.\n[1975-07-24 15:45:00] bedroom | I wished no one had seen me—then I could pretend I knew nothing. But I knew Dad would sense the truth. And with Grandma and Grandpa here, they’d surely tell him. If I tried to hide it, it would only make things worse.\n[1975-07-24 15:50:00] bedroom | I sat up on the bed. I felt something heavy pressing on my stomach, as if my whole body were soaked in cold and pain—a feeling that even tears couldn’t melt away.\n[1975-07-24 16:00:00] bedroom | I sat there for a while and started crying. I learned my brother wasn’t home—he had gone swimming. I thought to myself: If only my brother were here, I could just stay in his room.\n[1975-07-24 16:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I opened the door, tiptoed carefully down the hallway, and entered my brother’s room. I felt that being in his room brought me closer to him—even though the room was empty, it gave me a little more courage.\n[1975-07-24 16:10:10] Henrik Inge's room | I walked over and sat down on the bed. I saw that his bed and cabinet were blue, while mine were orange. I caught the scent that belonged uniquely to him.\n[1975-07-24 16:11:00] Henrik Inge's room | I noticed the window was slightly ajar. I realized this way I could hear what was happening on the balcony without exposing myself—luckier than I dared hope.\n[1975-07-24 16:15:00] Henrik Inge's room | I heard the sound of the radio from the living room in my ears. I heard my father’s calm and quiet voice, and I could tell he was in a good mood right now. I also heard my mother’s clearer, softer voice.\n[1975-07-24 16:20:00] Henrik Inge's room | For some reason, I imagined in my mind that my grandparents might be sitting asleep in their chairs, just as they had been when we visited them in Sørbyvåg, with their mouths open and eyes closed.\n[1975-07-24 16:30:00] Henrik Inge's room | I noticed they were clearing the table. I heard the tapping sound of my mother walking around the house in her slippers. Outside, I heard the clinking of cups and saucers knocking against each other.\n[1975-07-24 16:31:00] Henrik Inge's room | I waited by the door, listening for the sound of the downstairs door opening. I thought I would see my mother soon—then I could tell her everything first!\n[1975-07-24 16:35:00] hallway | I saw my mother walking up the stairs carrying a tray full of dishes and a coffee pot. I stepped out into the hallway. I heard my mother ask, 'Why are you standing here on such a nice day?' I answered, 'Yes.'\n[1975-07-24 16:35:10] hallway | I saw my mother stop and ask me, 'What’s wrong? Has something happened?' I lowered my eyes and told her, 'The TV is broken.'\n[1975-07-24 16:36:00] hallway | I nodded, watching as my mother prepared to call my grandparents. I heard my mother exclaim, 'Ah no, that’s terrible luck.' She told me the evening outside was beautiful and asked if I wanted to come out and have some juice too.\n[1975-07-24 16:40:00] bedroom | I shook my head and walked back to my room. I stopped just after stepping inside. I thought it might be wiser to go out with them—if my grandparents were there, maybe my father wouldn’t do anything to me.\n[1975-07-24 16:45:00] bedroom | I remembered the last time in Sørbyvåg, even though my father laughed in front of everyone, he later punished my brother fiercely for fighting. I realized that having outsiders present might only make him angrier.\n[1975-07-24 16:50:00] bedroom | I decided to stay in my room. I lay down on the bed again. I thought if he found out about the broken TV while outside, he might get angry. I felt an uncontrollable shiver run through my chest, and tears welled up again.\n[1975-07-24 17:00:00] bedroom | I couldn't help but cry out, deep down knowing he was about to come.\n[1975-07-24 17:10:00] bedroom | I covered my ears with my hands, closed my eyes, and tried to imagine that nothing had happened. Though the feeling of helplessness overwhelmed me, I still resisted inwardly, choosing not to give in.\n[1975-07-24 17:20:00] bedroom | I knelt on the bed and looked out the window. What met my eyes was the intense sunlight spilling across the ground, roofs and windowpanes glittering in its glare.\n[1975-07-24 17:30:00] bedroom | Hearing the door downstairs slam, I panicked and glanced around. I got off the bed and sat down on the chair in front of the desk. I heard the door bang shut, and a wave of fear surged through me.\n[1975-07-24 17:35:00] bedroom | I stood up and sat on the edge of the bed. I heard heavy footsteps ascending the stairs. I realized it was him coming upstairs. I thought I couldn't sit with my back to the door.\n[1975-07-24 17:36:00] bedroom | I saw him burst through the door and enter, his lips tightly pressed together. I lowered my eyes to avoid his gaze. I heard him stare at me and demand, \"What have you been doing, boy?\" I whispered back, \"Nothing.\"\n[1975-07-24 17:36:10] bedroom | I heard him shout, \"Look at me when I'm talking to you!\" I knew I had to look up, but I truly couldn't bear to meet his eyes at that moment.\n[1975-07-24 17:36:20] bedroom | I saw him stride quickly across the floor, grab my ear, twist it, and yank me to my feet. I struggled to look at him, but still couldn't meet his eyes. I heard him press me, \"Are your ears not working either? Look at me!\"\n[1975-07-24 17:36:30] bedroom | I heard him roar while twisting my ear cruelly, \"What did I say about turning on the TV?\" The pain left me sobbing—unable to answer.\n[1975-07-24 17:37:00] bedroom | I felt him release my ear and instead grab both my arms with his hands, shaking me violently. I cried out, \"I... I... I can't... turn on the TV by myself.\" Then I heard him bellow, \"Now look at me!\"\n[1975-07-24 17:37:10] bedroom | I lifted my head. I felt his fingers tighten around my arm. I heard him shout at me, demanding if I remembered his warning to stay away from the TV, yelling about where we’d get the money to buy a new one. I realized the shaking had nearly shaken all my tears dry.\n[1975-07-24 17:37:20] bedroom | I was thrown back onto the bed by him violently. I could only sob, 'N-no... w-wah... w-wah... no.'\n[1975-07-24 17:38:00] bedroom | I heard him order me to stay inside tonight and tomorrow, until he called for me. I whispered, 'Understood.'\n[1975-07-24 17:40:00] bedroom | I burst into loud sobs. I felt my chest and hands trembling uncontrollably. I saw him leave. Because I was crying so loudly, I couldn’t tell where he’d gone. I felt my breath coming in gasps, like climbing stairs.\n[1975-07-24 18:00:00] bedroom | I lay on the bed crying for about twenty minutes, then knelt up and peered out the window. Though my limbs were still trembling, I realized things were slowly returning to normal, like stepping into a quiet room after a storm.\n[1975-07-24 18:10:00] bedroom window | From the window, I could see the full view of the front gardens of the Prestbakmo and Oskar Magnus homes, as well as corners of the Karlsen and Kristensen houses.\n[1975-07-24 18:20:00] bedroom window | I saw the road stretching out to the mailbox. The sun hung above the treetops, the air still, everything motionless. I thought the afternoon sun seemed hotter, stronger somehow.\n[1975-07-24 18:30:00] bedroom window | I remembered Dad often said sitting in the front garden was like being in a 'shop window display.' I noticed people nearby really did place their furniture and barbecue grills at the back of their houses.\n[1975-07-24 18:40:00] road | I saw the door of the Karlsen house open, and Viktor Lunddal stepped out. I could only see the top of his head passing over car roofs, like a puppet in a puppet show.\n[1975-07-24 18:41:00] road | I saw him reappear on his bicycle, speeding up the hill, then turning and disappearing.",

    "text": "[1975-07-24 18:42:00] Tiena Lake Road | I knew Viktor’s father had died two years ago. I recalled once meeting him on a cold, sunny day on the way to Tiena Lake, when I was holding orange-colored ice skates in my hand.\n[1975-07-24 18:43:00] Outside my house | I remember Toya Moen standing on the stone by the roadside, telling us that Viktor’s father had died—right outside our house.\n[1975-07-24 18:44:00] Karlsen's house | I knew his father had died after being overcome by natural gas while cleaning an oil tank and falling from a height. Everyone had stood looking at his house back then.\n[1975-07-24 18:45:00] Tibaken | I knew we never talked about death or his father when Viktor was present. I also learned that a new neighbor with the same last name, Karlsen, had moved in.\n[1975-07-24 18:46:00] Tibaken | I knew the age order among us children. Viktor was second, Toya third, and I was the youngest—the seventh.\n[1975-07-24 18:50:00] Road | I saw Toya Moen get on her bicycle, and the two of them rode down the slope together. I heard Viktor shouting from in front of the house, 'Toya Moen, come out quickly!'\n[1975-07-24 19:00:00] Hillside | I saw Presbakkmo’s cat lying completely still on the flat hillside between the two houses.\n[1975-07-24 19:30:00] Bedroom | I went back to bed and lay there for a while. Then I got up, stepped off the bed, and pressed my ear against the door to listen. I sensed there was no sound outside and guessed they were still out there.\n[1975-07-24 20:00:00] Bedroom | I wondered whether it was true that Grandma and Grandpa wouldn’t let me have dinner when they came to visit. It seemed unimaginable, yet I worried it might actually be true.\n[1975-07-24 20:30:00] Bedroom | After hearing water running, I then heard heavy banging from the pipes. I heard someone go onto the balcony and enter the bathroom. From the footsteps, I realized it wasn’t Dad. I understood the loud clanging meant either Grandpa or Grandma was using the hot water.\n[1975-07-24 20:40:00] bedroom | I feel that I am already ravenous.\n[1975-07-24 21:00:00] bedroom window | I saw the shadows on the ground outside grow long and distorted, pausing in the deepening twilight. I feel as though these shadows are growing by themselves, as if there exists a parallel dark world—distorted and helpless.\n[1975-07-24 21:05:00] bedroom window | An image of rocks exposed at low tide floated into my mind. I silently remarked within myself: the shadows lengthen with the deepening night, like a tide of darkness flooding across the land.\n[1975-07-24 21:10:00] bedroom | I looked down at my watch; the hands pointed to nine-ten. I knew there were still twenty minutes until bedtime.\n[1975-07-24 21:15:00] bedroom | I thought about how the worst part of being locked up in the afternoon was only being able to stand by the window and watch people outside. I also realized that the worst part of being confined at night is losing the familiar rhythm of time.\n[1975-07-24 21:30:00] bedroom | After sitting for several hours, I undressed and lay down on the bed. I felt that the difference between sitting and lying here had been erased, which made me begin thinking about things I would normally never consider.\n[1975-07-24 21:35:00] bedroom | I realized that in this state, the version of me sitting clothed was exactly the same as the one lying naked—there seemed to be no clear boundary.\n[1975-07-24 21:40:00] bedroom | I silently sighed: this really is such an annoying feeling.\n[1975-07-24 21:50:00] bedroom | I walked to the door and listened closely, then crawled under the covers and pulled them up to my chin. I took off my T-shirt and shorts. I heard some movement outside at first, then everything fell silent. I couldn't help crying for a little while.\n[1975-07-24 22:00:00] bedroom | I saw the afterglow of sunset still shining on the wall. I read a few pages of a magazine, then placed them on the floor and closed my eyes. My last thought before falling asleep was: This isn’t my fault.\n[1975-07-25 02:10:00] bedroom | I woke up and looked at my wristwatch. I watched the two hands, glowing like little snakes, pointing at ten past two. I lay motionless for a while, trying to figure out what exactly had woken me.\n[1975-07-25 02:10:10] bedroom | It was deathly silent all around—no cars on the road, no boats in the bay, no planes in the sky. Everything was utterly still, except for my pulse beating, whispering softly in my ear. I realized there wasn’t a single sound in our house—at least not that I could hear.\n[1975-07-25 02:10:30] bedroom | I lifted my head slightly, held my breath, and positioned my ears so they wouldn't touch anything. After a few seconds, I heard a sharp, thin sound coming from the garden outside. The moment I noticed the sound, I was instantly filled with intense fear.\n[1975-07-25 02:10:40] garden | I heard a series of sounds by my ear—'zzz... chh... sss...'—repeating over and over.\n[1975-07-25 02:11:00] bedroom window | I knelt on the bed, reached out to pull the curtain aside, and stuck my head out the window to look. I saw the lawn bathed in hazy moonlight, with a full moon hanging above the house.\n[1975-07-25 02:11:10] bedroom window | I felt a gust of wind sweep past—the grass on the ground quickly bent forward in waves. The white plastic bag hanging at the end of the fence flapped loudly, 'flap-flap-flapping.' I thought, if I didn’t know it was just the wind, I’d have sworn the plastic bag was moving on its own.\n[1975-07-25 02:11:20] bedroom window | Even though I was high off the ground, my toes and fingertips were still trembling. I could feel my heart pounding beneath my chest, my abdominal muscles tightening. I remembered how night is the time when ghosts, zombies, headless figures, and skeletons roam—and between them and me was only a thin wall.\n[1975-07-25 02:11:30] garden | The 'sss... chh...' sound came into my ears again.\n[1975-07-25 02:12:00] garden | I carefully scanned the grayish grass outside with my eyes. Near the yard fence about five meters away, I saw the Presbakkmo family’s cat lying stretched out, pawing at something.\n[1975-07-25 02:12:10] garden | I saw the cat toss a grayish lump, which landed several meters from my window. The cat stood up and chased after it. The gray bundle lay motionless on the grass.\n[1975-07-25 02:12:20] garden | I saw the cat cautiously nudge it several times with its paw, lean forward and push it with its mouth, then open its jaws and pick it up. At that moment, the 'sisisi zizizi' sound rang out again. I guessed it must have been a mouse.\n[1975-07-25 02:12:30] garden | I saw the mouse dart across the grass as fast as it could while the cat was momentarily stunned. The cat abruptly shook its head and flung the mouse aside. I felt that the mouse's shrill squeal left the cat momentarily bewildered.\n[1975-07-25 02:13:00] garden | I watched the cat stand motionless, tracking the fleeing creature, then leap three times in succession, catching the mouse again and pinning it under its paw. From its demeanor, it seemed as though it had almost let the mouse go free just now.\n[1975-07-25 02:15:00] next room | I heard my father’s low, mumbled muttering from the next room. I knew he often talked like this in his sleep—nonsensical, fragmented words.\n[1975-07-25 02:15:10] next room | I heard someone get up from bed, followed by a series of light footsteps. From the sound of the footsteps, I realized it was Mother getting up.\n[1975-07-25 02:16:00] bedroom window | I looked up at the pine tree, watching its branches bend and sway in the wind. Outside, the cat began leaping up and down as if dancing. A gust of wind swept through, rippling across the grass. The dark treetops pointed toward the golden, plump moon in the sky.\n[1975-07-25 02:17:00] bathroom | I heard Mother open the bathroom door, heard her lower the toilet seat. I immediately covered my ears with my hands and started humming softly.\n[1975-07-25 02:17:10] bathroom | I thought that sound she made at that moment was one of the most unbearable noises to me. In comparison, although I didn’t like Father’s loud rumbling either, it was still somewhat tolerable.",

The mouse lay there quietly, completely still. I realized it was beginning to grow tired of the game of carrying the mouse around in its mouth.\n[1975-07-25 02:20:00] stone courtyard wall | I saw the cat leap onto the stone courtyard wall and walk toward the sundial ball on the pillar at the end of the wall. I lowered my hands from my ears. The rustling sound of water in the bathroom was nearing its end.\n[1975-07-25 02:21:00] road | I saw the cat suddenly turn its head, staring intently at the mouse. Then it jumped down from the stone wall and crouched low on the road like a little lion. The stream from the faucet struck the tiles of the sink.\n[1975-07-25 02:22:00] road | I saw the cat instantly shift from rest to pursuit. Though it had anticipated the move, this time it was still too slow. I heard my mother twist the doorknob and open the door. I noticed that at the very moment the door opened, the mouse twitched all over, as if the sound itself had injected it with energy for escape.\n[1975-07-25 02:22:10] under the asbestos cement board | I saw the mouse slip successfully beneath a white asbestos cement board just one or two seconds before the cat rushed forward. A white Eternit asbestos cement board lay on the grass, becoming the mouse’s shelter.\n[1975-07-25 02:30:00] bedroom | I lay back down on the bed. I felt my heart pounding violently against my chest; the aftereffects of that sudden surge of motion still affected me. I wondered—could my heart itself be a small, easily frightened creature?\n[1975-07-25 02:40:00] bedroom | I changed position, placing the pillow under my feet, and pulled aside a corner of the curtain to look up. I saw the sky filled with stars, scattered like grains of sand upon an invisible shore.\n[1975-07-25 02:45:00] bedroom | I remembered Dalson saying the universe was empty, and Karl Larsdal claiming it was burning. I pondered what outer space truly was. To me, the vast starry sky seemed comparable to the boundless ocean.\n[1975-07-25 03:00:00] bedroom | I pulled the curtain shut, closed my eyes, and fell asleep. My parents’ bedroom grew quiet; silence and darkness slowly filled the house.\n[1975-07-25 08:00:00] living room | I got up and walked into the living room, where I saw my grandmother, grandfather, and mother gathered together drinking coffee.\n[1975-07-25 08:05:00] lawn | I saw my father cross the lawn and place the sprinkler at the edge. A fine curtain of water droplets waved like a hand, sprinkling both the grass and the vegetable garden.\n[1975-07-25 08:10:00] garden | I saw sunlight spilling over the trees to the east and pouring into the garden, and the air seemed stagnant. The sky was veiled, as it usually was in the morning.\n[1975-07-25 08:15:00] dining table | I walked to my seat and sat down, seeing Henrik Inge already eating breakfast at the dining table. The table was filled with food; the white eggs in the brown egg cups reminded me it was Sunday.\n[1975-07-25 08:15:10] dining table | I heard Henrik Inge whisper, “What happened yesterday? Why were you locked in your room?” I told him, “I broke the TV.”\n[1975-07-25 08:15:20] dining table | I watched him take a bite of his cheese sandwich and stare at me with questioning eyes. I explained, “Yes, I just turned on the TV for Grandma and Grandpa, and then it went ‘poof’—it was done. Didn’t they mention it?”\n[1975-07-25 08:16:00] dining table | I watched Henrik Inge take a big bite of his cheese-covered bread and shake his head. I tapped the top of my eggshell with a knife, scooped out the egg white with a spoon, sprinkled salt on it, spread butter on my bread, and poured a glass of milk.\n[1975-07-25 08:17:00] dining table | I ate the egg white while probing with my spoon to check how well-cooked the egg was. I heard Dad opening the door downstairs, so I said, “They’re going to lock me in my room again today.”\n[1975-07-25 08:17:10] dining table | I shrugged, watching the golden yolk crumble at the touch of my spoon. I heard him ask, “All day? Or just tonight?” I replied, “I think, all day.” I noticed this egg was cooked especially hard.\n[1975-07-25 08:20:00] road | I saw the road outside completely empty, reflecting sunlight, while the ditch beneath the pine trees remained dark and shadowed.\n[1975-07-25 08:25:00] hillside below | I saw a boy riding a bicycle down the hill with a red gasoline canister attached. His dark hair fluttered in the wind; one hand gripped the handlebars, the other pressed against the fuel tank on the rear seat.\n[1975-07-25 08:25:00] dining table | I heard Dad’s footsteps on the stairs and immediately sat upright in my chair, quickly scanning the table to make sure everything was neat. I need to make sure everything is up to standard.\n[1975-07-25 08:30:10] dining table | I quickly scraped the egg crumbs hanging outside the egg cup into my plate with my hand.\n[1975-07-25 08:30:20] dining table | I saw Dad appear in the doorway. By then, Henrik Inge was already standing perfectly straight, his feet rooted to the floor like they were planted there. I noticed my brother was a bit slow to react, almost failing to steady himself in time.\n[1975-07-25 08:31:00] restaurant entrance | I heard Dad command, 'Pack your swimsuits, kids—we're driving to Hvasser.'\n[1975-07-25 08:31:10] dining table | I had wanted to ask, 'Am I going too?' but swallowed the words. Maybe he'd forgotten about the grounding, or changed his mind—I didn't want to remind him and make him feel wrong about what he'd done yesterday.\n[1975-07-25 08:40:00] bedroom/boiler room | I went to get my swimming trunks and the towel drying in the boiler room, packed them together with my diving mask into a plastic bag, and sat in my room waiting. I figured these things would definitely come in handy at Hvasser's beach.\n[1975-07-25 09:10:00] Hvasser beach | We set off toward the other end of the island. I listened to the water sloshing in the bottle as I walked across the silent rocks. I saw the sea unusually calm, the sun blazing overhead. The surrounding rocks and woods had an unreal quality to them. This might be the finest weather of the year; I felt everything was fresh, as if experiencing it for the first time.\n[1975-07-25 09:20:00] Hvasser beach | I saw the sea swelling and rippling, vanishing into the bright, hazy blue horizon.\n[1975-07-25 09:30:00] Hvasser beach | The whole family changed into swimwear and entered the water, letting the slightly warm seawater envelop our sun-scorched skin. Grandma and Grandpa sat there dressed in their finest clothes, looking completely out of place. I realized that Grandpa and Grandma’s attire and mannerisms were deeply rooted in the customs of the western region from the 1950s—etched into who they were.\n[1975-07-25 09:40:00] Hvasser beach | I saw them sitting on the rocks, squinting against the intense light coming from every direction. I thought how strange it was to see them there—they seemed so foreign in that setting.\n[1975-07-26 09:00:00] home / Jørstadvannet Lake | The next day, Grandma and Grandpa went home. Dad drove them back and visited Grandfather along the way. Mom took my brother and me to Jørstadvannet Lake, but she couldn’t find the way and we drove around for a long time. Just as we put down the cooler bag, it started raining. I saw the lake full of green algae, the stones wet and slippery. Heavy rain poured down almost at the same moment.",

I remembered that failed outing when Mom had tried to take us to Lake Jelstavåg for some proper relaxation, but it ended up ruined by getting lost and the rain. I felt sorry for Mom deep inside, yet also thought it best to forget those things quickly, as excitement for school filled my heart.\n[1975-08-09 10:00:00] town | I remember it was the second Saturday after buying the backpack—Mom and I went into town together. I looked at the backpack: it was square-shaped, bright blue on the outside, gleaming in the sunlight, with white shoulder straps. I realized this was the first and most important thing I needed to prepare for school.\n[1975-08-09 11:00:00] town | I saw that the inside of the backpack was divided into two layers. I immediately placed the orange pencil case I’d received into it, neatly arranging pencils, pens, erasers, and a sharpener. I also put in a grid-lined notebook and a few comic books, trying to pack the backpack completely full.\n[1975-08-15 10:00:00] home | I knew almost all the older kids claimed to hate school, and we even felt we should show that same attitude. As far as I understood, the fact of going to school brought us closer in status to those older children. I thought school was incredibly enticing, yet I still felt a bit uneasy about everything that would happen there—I longed to see more of these new and exciting things.\n[1975-08-15 10:00:10] school on the east side of the island | I learned that our local school had no space due to too many new students, so I was assigned to a school on the east side of the island, about five or six kilometers from home. I found out a public bus would come every day to pick up us kids who didn’t know each other. I realized this wasn’t just a privilege for me, but also an unknown adventure.\n[1975-08-15 21:00:00] bedroom | Every night before sleeping, I looked at the backpack leaning against the leg of my desk—a quiet and deeply expectant scene. I realized there were still several days until that big day, which always left me slightly restless before falling asleep, eager to begin first grade.\n[1975-08-17 10:00:00] in front of the hallway mirror | I noticed I still had a light-blue jacket and a pair of dark-blue running shoes. Many times when Dad was away, I would put on the new clothes, sling the backpack over my shoulders, and stand carefully examining myself in the hallway mirror. I kept mentally rehearsing how the first day of school would look.\n[1975-08-18 06:30:00] home | The next morning, I woke up early and watched the sun slowly rise behind the spruce trees along the road. Excitedly, I pulled my new clothes from the closet and put them on. I felt the house still immersed in silence and sleep. I knew Mom had specially washed my hair after last night’s shower, and now it felt refreshingly clean. I felt how joyful it was to finally wear my new clothes.\n[1975-08-18 06:40:00] living room / kitchen | I took the comics out of my backpack, repeatedly slung it on and off, adjusting the straps. I stood in front of the hallway mirror, pulling the zipper of my jacket up and down again and again, debating whether to zip it up or leave it open. Then I walked into the kitchen and saw that no one at Oskar Magnus’s house was moving yet. I heard birds singing outside, and before me stretched the summer sky—pale clouds and vast blue, with the red-and-yellow sun bursting forth from behind the thick green foliage. I thought if I zipped up, no one would see my cool T-shirt, and I felt really torn.\n[1975-08-18 06:50:00] bathroom | I walked into the bathroom, wetted my toothbrush, squeezed on white toothpaste, and brushed eagerly for a long time. While brushing, I stared intently at my reflection in the mirror. I felt brushing my teeth was the only thing I could actively prepare for right now.\n[1975-08-18 06:55:00] bathroom | I saw Dad push the door open and come in, wearing only his underwear. I was fixed by his stern gaze and immediately put down my toothbrush. I heard Dad shout, \"You're brushing your teeth before breakfast? What on earth are you up to? Put that toothbrush down right now and go back to your room!\" The loud sound of the toothbrush scraping against my teeth had been ringing in my ears, which was why I hadn't heard his footsteps earlier.\n[1975-08-18 07:00:00] hallway / bedroom | I had just stepped onto the red carpet in the hallway when I heard a loud bang behind me as the door slammed shut. I knelt on the bed and looked up at the Presbakkmo house, seeing two heads moving about in their kitchen. I heard the sound of urine gushing into the toilet bowl. I thought how perfect it would be if I could talk to Karl Larsdal right now through a walkie-talkie.\n[1975-08-18 07:10:00] bedroom / kitchen | I saw Dad leave the bathroom and return to the bedroom. Once Mom went into the kitchen, I quietly slipped behind her back and took my seat. I heard Dad and Mom speaking softly to each other.\n[1975-08-18 07:20:00] kitchen | I poured milk over the oddly shaped cornflakes and added a huge amount of sugar. Holding my spoon, I ate bite after bite. I smelled the sweet scent of milk mixed with sugar. I knew we almost never bought cornflakes at home—it felt rare and special to me. I originally thought crispy cornflakes were the best, but after eating for a while, I realized I actually preferred them soft and soggy, soaked through with milk and sugar.\n[1975-08-18 07:30:00] kitchen / living room | I watched Dad carry his coffee into the living room to smoke. My brother came in too, silently starting to eat his cornflakes. I heard my brother ask me, \"Are you happy?\" I whispered, \"A little.\" I heard Mom reply to my brother, \"No, you should be happy—I know it. Don’t you remember?\" My brother mumbled, \"I guess I should be happy then.\"\n[1975-08-18 07:45:00] at home | I learned that my brother usually rode his bike to school. As far as I knew, Dad wouldn’t let him hitch a ride unless it was snowing heavily, because he didn’t want his son receiving special treatment at the school where he taught.\n[1975-08-18 08:00:00] gravel yard outside the house | I stood on the gravel yard outside the house while Mom took pictures of me with her camera. I looked down at my appealing new clothes and adjusted my backpack. I knew this day had finally arrived. I felt a peculiar sensation—almost like triumph. At the same time, excitement and anticipation made my stomach feel ticklish, as if something were scratching inside.\n[1975-08-18 08:30:00] kitchen | After breakfast, I sat in the kitchen watching Mom read the newspaper. I kept asking her questions nonstop. I heard myself ask excitedly, \"Mom, do you think we’ll be writing in our first class? Toya Moen says we’ll be drawing, but I’ve known how to write and do arithmetic since I was five and a half—you remember, don’t you?\" I tried to ease my nervousness about starting school by showing off how precocious I was.\n[1975-08-18 08:35:00] kitchen | I took the newspaper and loudly read out the headline, stumbling slightly but getting every word right. I heard Mom laugh and say, \"You’re doing great—you’ll surely be good at reading in school.\" I explained to her the story of how I once misread 'Jia Fei Guan' at the train station when I was little. As far as I knew, I now understood that the word was actually 'coffee shop'.\n[1975-08-18 08:40:00] kitchen | I saw Mom lower the newspaper and look at me. Then she smiled, gently patted my head, got up to clear the table, and I returned to my room shortly after. I heard her ask, \"Are you looking forward to it?\" I answered firmly, \"Yes, I am.\" I noticed that while reading the paper, Mom absentmindedly scratched her ear—a gesture that looked exactly like a cat’s.\n[1975-08-18 09:30:00] in the car / on the road | I saw the neighbor's children all neatly leaving home for photos and driving away through the window. Mom urged me to hurry, and I climbed into the back seat of the green Volkswagen with my backpack. I saw the sun already high above the spruce trees. I knew school didn't start until ten, but Mom, as always, had made our schedule tight. I realized we were once again the last household in the neighborhood to leave, and I felt a bit anxious.\n[1975-08-18 09:40:00] in the car / on the road | I sat in the middle of the back seat, looking forward between the front seat backs. Mom lit a cigarette, and the car roared loudly as it started up. We were heading toward the sea. I saw the gas tanks across the bay, wild cherry trees, and red houses flash by quickly. As we entered the eastern part of the island, I sensed Mom growing uneasy because she wasn’t familiar with the route. I knew that over the next six years, I would come to know every branch along this road by heart.\n[1975-08-18 09:50:00] in the car / eastern part of the island | I looked out at the deep blue sea, nearly black in the shadows. Mom crushed her cigarette butt into the ashtray. I heard Mom nervously ask, 'Is it down there, Grete Lundnes, do you remember?' I replied, 'I don’t remember, but I think it’s on the left.' I saw the little shop and houses by the pier, but no sign of the school. The cool blue of the sea contrasted with the surrounding yellows and browns.\n[1975-08-18 10:00:00] in the car / on the road | I saw the car turning around repeatedly on the gravel road. Mom was searching for a new path, but even at the end of the road, the school remained nowhere in sight. I asked anxiously, 'Are we late?' Mom sighed, 'Maybe. I didn’t bring the map!' I pressed her, asking if she’d never been here before, and she said she couldn’t quite remember. Dust swirled up behind the car.",

    "text": "[1975-08-18 10:10:00] in the car / near the school | The car drove up a slope and then circled down. I pointed excitedly at a grassy field to the right and shouted. We saw a crowd gathered on the school playground, someone giving a speech beneath the flagpole. I screamed, 'There it is, Mom! We have to hurry! They’ve already started!' A small gravel road came into view, already filled with parked cars. I suddenly remembered that the school lay at the end of this gentle slope. I could feel my heartbeat quicken, afraid of missing the most important moment.\n[1975-08-18 10:15:00] school playground | Mom pulled my arm as we jogged across the field toward the playground. I felt my backpack thumping against my back with each step. I heard Mom say, 'We need to find a parking spot first. Maybe over there.' I saw the old white gymnasium building. I looked down at my light blue pants and brand-new dark blue shoes. Each thump of my backpack reminded me that today was an important day.\n[1975-08-18 10:20:00] school playground | I pulled Mom’s hand and rushed toward Karl Larsdal. I noticed the boys’ backpacks were almost identical, while the girls’ were all different. I heard Mom sigh, 'We must have missed the opening ceremony.' I reassured her loudly, 'It’s okay, Mom, let’s go!' I saw the crowd on the playground dispersing and walking toward the classroom building. I scanned the students’ backpack styles as quickly as I could, searching for common patterns.\n[1975-08-18 10:25:00] classroom corridor | Karl Larsdal and I ran up the stairs through the crowd. The teacher stopped at the edge of the staircase, so we stopped too. I heard Mom ask Marta, 'Where are we going?' Marta smiled and pointed ahead, 'We’re following their teacher.' I had wanted to rush to the front of the line, but when the teacher stopped, we ended up among the last.\n[1975-08-18 10:30:00] Class 1B | I sat in my seat in the classroom, watching the teacher stand behind the podium. Pink chalk letters on the blackboard spelled out a welcome message. I heard the teacher say, 'Hi everyone, welcome to Sandnes Elementary! My name is Ciliavik Oscar, and I’m your homeroom teacher.' She also mentioned it was her first time being a homeroom teacher. Through the window, I could see a small patch of green lawn and dense woods. Maps and charts covered the wall above the teacher’s desk. I noticed the teacher seemed very happy, which helped me relax a little.\n[1975-08-18 10:40:00] Class 1B | I looked around and realized that apart from a few familiar faces, most of the children were strangers. When the teacher asked what roll call was, I raised my hand. I answered loudly, 'You say a name, and the person whose name is called shouts “Here!”' I noticed the adults smiling, while the children sized each other up. I knew that some of the kids who used to throw stones at me were also in this class. I longed to show off my intelligence in front of everyone.\n[1975-08-18 10:45:00] Classroom 1B | I grinned, showing my prominent front teeth. I turned my head toward each person as they responded to the roll call. I heard the teacher praise me: 'That's correct.' Then she called out: 'Ingeborg Lofnes!' I heard a girl respond clearly: 'Here.' I saw a thin little girl with shiny black hair who looked like an Indian. I noticed everyone's gaze shifting along with the roll call.\n[1975-08-18 11:00:00] Classroom 1B | I sat behind my desk, receiving the notebook, notepads, and the piggy bank printed with a golden ant from the teacher. Then we spent some time drawing on paper. I heard the teacher explain the fall semester swimming schedule and hand out mimeographed forms. I saw all the parents standing against the walls, watching us intently. I learned that since Rocky didn't have a swimming pool, we would have to go to a school on the other side of the bay for training. I realized tomorrow it would become real—then there would be no parents standing behind us to protect us.\n[1975-08-18 12:00:00] School playground / Inside the car | I followed Mom out of the classroom and got into the car. Along the way, I watched the scenery pass by outside the window, feeling a sense of loss. I fiddled with my new pencil case and mentally counted the layers of my backpack over and over. I saw the playground crowded with cars leaving at once—a sight I'd only seen on National Day. I had hoped to show off my reading and writing skills on the first day, but in the end, there was no chance. This left me feeling empty.\n[1975-08-18 13:00:00] Kitchen | I took off my new clothes and hung them in the closet. I sat on a stool in the kitchen, watching Mom cook and trying to chat with her. I asked tentatively, 'Mom, can't we keep a cat?' I heard Mom laugh and reply, 'We'll see—it's not that simple.' I knew Dad probably wouldn't be interested in having a cat. I understood that to Mom, keeping a cat would be troublesome. I wanted to use this special day to get Mom to agree. I thought that if all three of us were willing, there might be a chance.\n[1975-08-18 14:00:00] Kitchen | I peered through a small hole in the curtain and saw Karl Larsdal running toward the house. I heard the crunching sound of his feet on the gravel driveway. I smelled the sharp odor of onions and saw Mom crying as she chopped them. Outside the window, the sunlit road lay empty. I noticed Karl had already changed back into his everyday clothes.\n[1975-08-18 14:10:00] Driveway outside the house | I slid off the chair, dashed downstairs, opened the door, and quickly put on my running shoes. I saw Karl excitedly patting his pocket. I heard Karl whisper urgently, 'Grete Lundnes, come out! I've got a box of matches.' I replied, 'I'm going out.' I rushed out so Karl wouldn't leave thinking no one was home.\n[1975-08-18 14:15:00] Driveway outside the house | I shut the door behind me. We decided to go up the hill to find a secluded spot to play with fire. I decided to go back inside to grab a bottle of water just in case. I whispered in shock, 'Where did you get them?' Hearing he'd stolen them from home, I suggested, 'We need to burn something—somewhere no one can see the smoke.' I realized this was a dangerous secret mission—we must bring something to put out the fire.\n[1975-08-18 14:20:00] Kitchen | I kicked off my shoes and ran back into the kitchen. I watched Mom take a dark green empty bottle from under the sink cabinet, fill it with water, and give me two liver pâté sandwiches. I heard Mom ask, 'Don't you want juice?' My heart raced as I lied, 'No, Karl brought water too.' I felt a pang of guilt—I knew juice tasted better, but I was afraid bringing juice would make her suspicious.\n[1975-08-18 14:30:00] Driveway outside the house / On the path | I shouted down through the open window, then grabbed the bag with the water bottle and sandwiches and ran to meet Karl. We walked uphill, the road softening under the scorching sun. I called to Karl, 'Coming!' Walking, I couldn't wait to ask, 'Can I see them?' I felt the blazing sun baking our backs. I saw the seriousness in Karl's eyes and felt the tension of this secret mission.\n[1975-08-18 14:40:00] On the path | I took the matchbox and shook it, seeing it was full of red-tipped matches. We entered a narrow trail where dry grass showed patches of yellow and green. I warned Karl, 'We can't light it here! Everyone can see!' Karl snorted, 'If they find out, I won't admit it.' I noticed how dry the grass was—some parts already brown. As far as I knew, Karl's mother was strict and his father gentle. I knew no one else's father was as severe as mine. I silently prayed we wouldn't get caught.",

    "text": "[1975-08-18 15:00:00] mountaintop | We stood behind the massive tree roots, and I gripped my water bottle, ready at any moment. I saw Karl strike a match and bring it close to a small blade of grass; the tip instantly caught fire and began spreading. I immediately poured water down on it. I heard Karl laugh and ask, \"Do you think anyone can see this?\" I confidently told him, \"The smoke can be seen from many kilometers away—this is how Indians send signals.\" I saw sunlight piercing through the branches and casting patterns on the ground, like trembling little wild beasts. A spontaneous wisp of greenish smoke rose into the air. I felt a deep tremor of excitement inside me.\n[1975-08-18 15:10:00] mountaintop woods | I took the matchbox Karl handed me. I saw him scanning around, searching for the next target. I heard Karl laugh loudly, \"It's burning fast.\" I said, \"I see it—now it's my turn to light it.\"\n[1975-08-18 15:15:00] mountaintop woods | I realized that once Karl got involved in something, he threw himself into it completely—even pretending we were bouncing across the moon. I knew he could invent countless fantastical games among the car wreckage on the meadow. I thought he was the most imaginative person I'd ever known. I believed his intense focus on things themselves was something Toya or Karlsen didn't possess.\n[1975-08-18 15:20:00] various places in Tibaken | I smelled the scent of raw lacquer and seawater from the shipyard. I saw the collapsed shacks by Lake Tierna, their planks darkened and rotting. Along the roadside stood crystal-clear peaks like transparent gems. I knew every corner of this area within a kilometer or two. I understood that here were all the secrets we had discovered: hollow oak trees, underwater caves, even the remains of old wrecked cars. I realized these places were secrets that belonged absolutely only to Karl and me.\n[1975-08-18 15:30:00] mountaintop woods | I walked over to a dry, withered spruce tree and snapped a needle between my fingers. I knelt down and struck the match head against the black striking surface—it flared to life. I noticed the wild grass growing on the parched soil was thin and brittle, nearly orange in color. I realized that today, all the sense of mystery came from what we were doing, not from the environment itself.\n[1975-08-18 15:35:00] mountaintop woods | I saw the flame at first tremble like a chill along the tips of the grass, then rapidly curl and spread. Suddenly, the fire leapt up to my waist. I shouted at Karl in panic, \"Put it out! Put it out!\" I felt the fire’s movement as both fierce and slow, like a fleeing swarm of ants. In an instant, my heart leapt into my throat.\n[1975-08-18 15:40:00] mountaintop woods | I watched Karl shake the water bottle and douse the flames; I also used my palms to frantically beat down the low-burning fire. When the fire was out, I let out a long breath. I heard Karl laugh and exclaim, \"That was close! The fire really went up this time!\" In my ears lingered the faint hissing sound of the dying flames.\n[1975-08-18 15:45:00] edge of the hillside | I hurried across the moss- and heather-covered ground. I turned back and asked Karl if anyone had seen us. Without waiting for his answer, I slipped alone into the woods. Suddenly, overwhelming fear filled my heart. Thinking about what had just happened, my mind felt torn open into a bottomless abyss. I was so afraid I broke into a cold sweat.\n[1975-08-18 15:50:00] edge of the hillside | I stopped at the edge of the hillside, shielding my eyes from the sun as I looked down. I saw my father's car parked in the driveway. Oskar Magnus was walking across the lawn. I felt my body might explode from fear. I thought my father might have seen everything, and Oskar might go tell on us. My mind was flooded with terrifying images of what would happen if he found out the truth.\n[1975-08-18 15:55:00] edge of the hillside | I saw Karl approaching, carrying my plastic bag. Down below, a child was playing in the sand by the roadside. A car turned the corner and disappeared. I signaled Karl to evacuate quickly. I urgently told Karl, \"We can't go down this way—if someone saw the smoke, they'll connect it to us. Let's get out of here now!\" I kept asking myself over and over: Why did we do this? Why?\n[1975-08-18 16:10:00] slope bottom woods | I stumbled through the woods about ten meters from the road, walking home. I stopped beside a huge spruce tree, reached into the stream to wash off any possible traces, and dried my hands on my pants. I saw the trunk covered in sticky, caramel-like resin and smelled a strong juniper scent. The stream before me was shallow and wide, muddy and murky, glowing with a dim greenish light. Through the slender trunks of rowan trees, I could see my own house. I carefully examined my hands, making sure there was no ash on them, but I still felt as if I could smell something burnt.\n[1975-08-18 16:20:00] road intersection | Karl Larsdal returned the plastic bag to me, and together we walked toward the road. At the intersection, I watched him run up the slope. I asked Karl what he planned to do with the matchbox, warning him not to mention me if he got caught. I heard him reply that he would hide it, and then he said goodbye. I worried he might give in and light a fire again today, even take it to school—I thought he was completely crazy.\n[1975-08-18 16:30:00] gravel path in yard | I passed my mother’s Volkswagen and stepped onto the gravel path in the yard. I lowered my head and came to the front steps, folding my hands and closing my eyes. I saw my father’s car shining with a brilliant red glow under the intense sunlight. A new fear welled up inside me, and I desperately prayed to God that nothing would happen. I swore to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit that I would never do anything wrong again.\n[1975-08-18 16:35:00] hallway at home | I walked into the hallway, bent down to untie my shoelaces, and carefully placed my shoes against the wall. I paused at the foot of the stairs, trying to make my expression look normal. The hallway was cooler than outside, dimly lit, and thick with the smell of stewed meat. I was torn—wondering whether I should go straight to my room or step into the kitchen to see about dinner.\n[1975-08-18 16:35:10] hallway at home | I heard the clatter of dishes in the kitchen. I thought: Oh no, had they already eaten? I even considered fleeing back to the mountain and never returning—then they would surely regret it.\n[1975-08-18 16:35:20] kitchen | I heard my father call from the kitchen: “Is that you, Grete Lundnes?”\n[1975-08-18 16:35:30] hallway at home | I swallowed hard, gave a slight nod, and took a deep breath. I answered: “Yes.”\n[1975-08-18 16:35:40] kitchen | I heard him shout: “We’re eating! Come in quickly!”\n[1975-08-18 16:36:00] kitchen | I walked into the kitchen and saw my father sitting in his chair, legs stretched out, body leaning back, arms spread wide to both sides. I realized God had heard my prayer. Looking at my father’s shining eyes and the sly glint in them, I concluded he was in a good mood now.\n[1975-08-18 16:36:10] kitchen | I heard my father ask: “What were you doing that made you forget to come home on time?”\n[1975-08-18 16:37:00] kitchen | I sat down beside Henrik Inge. I looked at the plates on the table, the green glasses, and the large pot with a wooden spoon sticking out of it. Before me was a gray-and-white marble-patterned dining table; the bottom of the glass bore the engraving 'Dores.' A basket held crispbread.\n[1975-08-18 16:37:10] kitchen | I leaned forward, staring at the chunks of meat in the pot. I told him, \"I went out with Karl Larsdal.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:37:20] kitchen | I heard my father press further: \"Then where did you go?\" I noticed a small piece of onion clinging to the beard on his chin. I saw him staring straight at me.\n[1975-08-18 16:37:30] kitchen | I replied casually, \"Straight into the woods.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:37:40] kitchen | I heard him say while chewing, \"Really? I thought I saw you heading up the mountain path?\" I felt his gaze locked onto my face.\n[1975-08-18 16:38:00] kitchen | I sat there, paralyzed, unable to move my body. Finally, with difficulty, I said, \"We didn't go there.\" I was terribly frightened, thinking he suspected us after all.\n[1975-08-18 16:38:10] kitchen | I heard my father snap, \"Nonsense! You don't want to admit you went there—what were you two up to anyway?\"\n[1975-08-18 16:38:20] kitchen | I insisted, \"But we didn't go up the mountain.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:40:00] kitchen | I saw my mother and father exchange a glance. I started eating again and noticed my brother sitting beside me, staring blankly ahead. I felt my hands regain movement, and breathed a slight sigh of relief.\n[1975-08-18 16:45:00] kitchen | I heard my father shift topics and ask, \"Well then, what did the schoolchildren do today? Do you have homework?\"\n[1975-08-18 16:45:10] kitchen | I shook my head at Dad.\n[1975-08-18 16:45:20] kitchen | I nodded at him. He asked how the teacher was, and I replied that the teacher's name was \"Ciliavik Oscar\".\n[1975-08-18 16:45:30] kitchen | I told him the teacher lived in Sanddum.\n[1975-08-18 16:46:00] kitchen | I heard Mom say the teacher was very young and quite nice. I mumbled in addition: \"But we were late.\" After the conversation shifted direction, I felt completely relaxed.\n[1975-08-18 16:46:10] kitchen | I heard Dad ask Mom in surprise: \"Ah? You didn't tell me that?\"\n[1975-08-18 16:46:20] kitchen | I heard Mom explain that she had taken the wrong route, but they were only a few minutes late, and they hadn't missed anything important. She turned to me and asked: \"That's right, isn't it, Grete Lundnes?\" I answered: \"Yes.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:47:00] kitchen | I quickly swallowed my food. I heard Dad command: \"Don't talk with your mouth full.\" I responded: \"Yes.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:48:00] kitchen | I watched Henrik Inge sit up straight in his chair. Dad asked him if anything surprising had happened today, and my brother answered \"No\".\n[1975-08-18 16:49:00] kitchen | I heard Mom ask my brother if he was going to football practice, and he confirmed it.",

    "text": "[1975-08-18 16:49:10] Saltrode | I knew he had left the island team and joined the Saltrode club. I learned their sportswear looked great, and that he needed to ride his bike alone across the bridge to training, a distance of about five kilometers.\n[1975-08-18 16:50:00] kitchen | I heard Dad continue to ask me, \"So, nothing else happened at school, Grete Lundnes?\"\n[1975-08-18 16:50:10] kitchen | I nodded and swallowed my food. I told them, \"We're having swimming lessons—six sessions—at another school.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:50:20] kitchen | I watched Dad wipe his mouth with the back of his hand, but that piece of onion was still hanging there. I heard Dad say approvingly that people living on an island must know how to swim. Mom agreed it was a free class.\n[1975-08-18 16:51:00] kitchen | I told them, \"But I need a swimming cap—everyone does. Maybe a new swimsuit too?\" Dad said the cap was fine, but a new pair of pants wasn't necessary.\n[1975-08-18 16:51:10] kitchen | I kept asking for swimming goggles. Dad looked at me with a teasing expression and said, \"We'll talk about that later.\"\n[1975-08-18 16:55:00] kitchen | I saw Dad push his plate toward the center of the table and lean back in his chair. I heard him say loudly, \"Thank you for the meal, Mom—it was great!\"\n[1975-08-18 16:55:10] kitchen | I watched my brother slip out of the kitchen. Five seconds later, I heard the sound of his bedroom door closing. I heard my brother say, \"Thanks for the meal,\" as well.\n[1975-08-18 17:00:00] kitchen / bedroom | I watched Dad get up, put his plate into the sink, grab an orange and the newspaper, and head downstairs to his office. I watched Mom clear the table, then walked into Henrik Inge's room myself. I was thinking Dad might want to talk to me again, and I felt a bit uneasy.\n[1975-08-18 17:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I sat on Henrik Inge's bed and watched him pack. I noticed his black football cleats and yellow-and-black striped socks. I couldn't help leaning in to smell the shiny, smooth jersey. I knew he had gotten new socks and given me the old ones. His jersey was Adidas, made of a fabric completely different from previous sportswear. The scent of that jersey felt utterly magical to me. I think because I longed so deeply to own something like it, its smell carried in my mind the hope of a future—something that seemed not of this ordinary world.\n[1975-08-18 17:15:00] Henrik Inge's room | I watched him zip up his bag, sit down at his desk to look over his schedule, then stand up with a smile and walk out. I asked if he had any homework or book covers—he said no to both. I heard him joke, \"If I don't come back by midnight, it means the headless man has eaten me!\" I thought about how Mom would help me cover my books tonight, and I felt pretty good.\n[1975-08-18 17:20:00] outside ramp | I watched him through the bathroom window. I saw him glide for a stretch, then swing onto the bike frame and pedal quickly up the steep slope, disappearing at the crossroads.\n[1975-08-18 17:25:00] hallway at home | I stood quietly in the hallway, observing where Mom and Dad were. I whispered softly, “Mom?” But there was no response from anywhere.\n[1975-08-18 17:30:00] kitchen / bedroom / garden | I searched the kitchen, living room, master bedroom, and garden one by one, but couldn’t find Mom anywhere.\n[1975-08-18 17:35:00] bedroom | I confirmed that Mom’s car was still parked outside. I returned to my room and sat on the edge of the bed, reading a few magazines. I felt that without knowing where Mom was, the house seemed to lose a kind of cohesion. But then it suddenly occurred to me—she must be downstairs in Dad’s office.\n[1975-08-18 17:40:00] Dad's office | I knew that the office was almost always off-limits, unless I had something important to ask. I was familiar with the old sink used specifically for washing stamps. As far as I knew, knocking on that door usually came with a heavy psychological cost. I remembered the times when I washed stamps, then dried them and placed them carefully into the stamp album.\n[1975-08-18 17:45:00] Dad's office | I knew that when I was home alone, I once wanted to sneak in, but the risk was too great. I understood Dad’s astonishing perceptiveness—how he could instantly tell what wrong we’d done up in the mountains. I realized he could always sense anything unusual, no matter how hard I tried to hide it.\n[1975-08-18 17:50:00] bedroom | I lay on the bed reading the magazine *Tintin* that my brother had lent me. I studied the illustrations of race car drivers and comic book heroes carefully. I had read these magazines countless times. To me, they belonged to a perfect world. Though I wasn’t picky about the content, I found myself drawn more to stories grounded in reality, because those cars and equipment could also be seen on television.\n[1975-08-18 18:00:00] outside the office | I quickly put down the magazine and tied my shoes in the hallway. I knocked on the office door. I called out inside: “I’m going out! To Karl Larsdal’s!” Through the crack of the door, I recalled the space inside included a bathroom, office, and storage room. I knew this was a self-contained apartment, but our family had never rented it out. I felt restless. Even though it wasn’t quite five o’clock yet, I decided to go out for a walk.\n[1975-08-18 18:00:10] outside the office | First I heard Dad impatiently shout, “Alright, alright!” Then I heard Mom’s gentle voice: “Okay, go ahead, Grete Lundnes!” I sensed that Mom’s voice served as a soothing counterbalance to Dad’s irritable tone.\n[1975-08-18 18:05:00] outside Karl Larsdal's house | I slipped out the door and ran quickly toward Karl’s house. I called out a few times at the entrance, watching as his mother came around carrying a red garden spade. Karl’s mother said to me: “Hi, Grete Lundnes, Karl just went out with Tove.” I saw she was wearing khaki shorts and black clogs, with gardening gloves on.\n[1975-08-18 18:05:10] Outside Karl Larsdal's house | I hurriedly asked, \"Where did they go?\" I heard Karl's mother reply, \"I don't know. He didn't say.\" I then said, \"OK. Goodbye!\"\n[1975-08-18 18:10:00] Driveway | I turned around and slowly walked up the driveway. I stood on the divider block between the two roads, standing quietly for a while, straining to listen for any sound of them. There was no sound at all around me. I felt sad, tears welling in my eyes. I couldn't understand why they had gone off to play without ringing my doorbell.\n[1975-08-18 18:15:00] Roadside divider block | I sat down on one of the concrete divider blocks. I could feel the rough concrete pressing painfully against my thighs. I saw dandelions covered in dust growing from the cracks below, and beside them, a rusted, abandoned barbecue grill with a faded cigarette pack stuck in the wire mesh.\n[1975-08-18 18:20:00] Roadside divider block | I stood up and started walking downward. I looked up ahead, but saw no trace of them. I mentally ran through the places they might have gone: Ullbukt, the dock, or the playground? I wondered if Karl might have taken Tove to our secret hill—the one that belonged only to us.\n[1975-08-18 18:30:00] Path to the dock | I took the right-hand path, passed the gate, and followed the trail. I walked through flattened knee-high grass, past bare cliffs covered in gray lichen, and through the woods onto the road. I saw the massive oak canopy casting deep shade, with soil and branches partially covering the path. I knew there were three paths leading to the floating dock.\n[1975-08-18 18:40:00] Small boat harbor | I crossed the street to the new small boat harbor. I noticed a boat had just docked—Kanestrøm’s boat—so I went over to see what was happening. I saw Kanestrøm standing alone on the deck. I heard Kanestrøm call out to me, \"Is that you wandering around out there? See? I came out for a little stroll, doing some fishing.\" I saw three identical docks here, each with wooden walkways and bright orange pontoons. I realized they weren’t here either.\n[1975-08-18 18:45:00] Kanestrøm's boat | I saw him lift a red bucket toward me, filled with long, slimy mackerel shimmering with blue iridescence. I noticed some of the fish were still twitching and jumping spasmodically. I heard him offer, \"Want to take a look?\" The sun glinted brightly off his glasses. I saw he had a mustache, a bald spot on top of his head, and was wearing a plaid shirt and denim shorts. I stared at the fish pressing against one another, feeling as though they formed one moving mass.\n[1975-08-18 18:45:10] Kanestrøm's boat | I exclaimed, \"Whoa! Did you catch all of those yourself?\" I heard him confirm it with pride.\n[1975-08-18 18:46:00] Kanestrøm's boat | I saw him place the fish bucket on the gangway and set an old gasoline can beside it. He kept humming an old tune. I heard him boast, \"All within just a few minutes. A whole school of fish right along the shore. My dinners are set for the next few days!\" Fishing reels and boxes filled with hooks and bait were scattered nearby.\n[1975-08-18 18:47:00] Kanestrøm's boat | I asked, \"Do you know where Dalson is?\" I heard him apologize, saying he didn’t know, and asked if I was looking for him.\n[1975-08-18 18:48:00] Kanestrøm's boat | I shook my head. I heard him invite me, “Perhaps you’d like to come up here and sit?” I refused, “I don’t want to. I’ve got so much to do.”",

    "text": "[1975-08-18 18:50:00] parking lot / forest path | I left as quickly as I could. I ran across the gravel parking lot, practiced balance on the stone curbs by the roadside, then ducked into a steep path leading into the woods. I heard him say, “Alright then.” I didn’t want to stay with him any longer—I just wanted to get away fast.\n[1975-08-18 18:55:00] Nåben | I arrived at Nåben, where there were two-meter-high rocks to jump from into the water, and I could swim toward Yrsta island ten meters away. I knew this was a popular swimming spot for people in the residential area. As far as I knew, the water there was deep. Even though I couldn’t swim, I still liked going there occasionally because it was always lively.\n[1975-08-18 19:00:00] forest path | I stopped on the forest path. I saw Dalson and Gretevik come into view, carrying towels, their hair wet. I heard two voices of different pitches from the woods, then heard Dalson call out, “Hey, Grete Lundnes! I saw a venomous snake at a place!” Sunlight cast dappled shadows between the tree trunks.\n[1975-08-18 19:00:10] forest path | I watched Dalson and Gretevik stop in front of me. I noticed that Gretevik had long black hair and faint facial hair above his lips. I asked in surprise, “Really? Where? Here?” I heard him nod in confirmation. I knew Gretevik was in lower secondary school, played bass, and had his own room in the basement. I sensed that Gretevik seemed impatient, as if he didn’t want to waste time talking to me and just wanted to leave.\n[1975-08-18 19:01:00] forest path | I heard Dalson describe, “I was running down when I turned the corner, and there was a venomous snake lying right in the middle of the path. I almost couldn’t stop in time!”\n[1975-08-18 19:01:10] forest path | I asked nervously, “And then what?” I heard him say, “It darted into the bushes like a flash of lightning.”\n[1975-08-18 19:01:20] forest path | I saw Dalson looking at me, a smile spreading across his face. I pressed on, “Are you sure it was a venomous snake?” I heard him answer firmly, “Absolutely, no doubt about it. It had zigzag markings on its head.” I noticed his face was triangular, with light-colored hair and gentle, eager blue eyes. I thought that in this world, snakes and insects were what I feared most.\n[1975-08-18 19:02:00] forest path | I asked, “Can I come up with you?” I heard him say only Jon, his younger brother, and Marianne’s parents were down below.\n[1975-08-18 19:05:00] forest path | I heard Dalson say cheerfully, “Of course, but I can’t play—I have to go home for dinner now.” I chimed in, “Same with me, I need to go home too. I have to cover my new schoolbag.”\n[1975-08-18 19:15:00] path in front of the house | I saw them off and stood for a moment on the road outside my home, scanning around for Karl and Toya. I hesitated before moving forward. I felt the sun hanging above the ridge, burning my shoulders. I realized I couldn't see any trace of them anywhere.\n[1975-08-18 19:20:00] path behind the house | I cast one final glance down toward the road, then ran into the path behind the house. I sprinted along my yard's fence and the neighbor's stone wall. I heard the aspen trees rustling softly in the afternoon sea breeze. I imagined they might suddenly appear at the crossroads.\n[1975-08-18 19:25:00] marshland | I passed through dense deciduous forest and entered a marshy area. I saw a huge beech tree leaning out from a steep cliff, beneath which lay a small patch of grass shaded in green.\n[1975-08-18 19:30:00] woods | I noticed the shadows growing slowly between the trees. I saw how the great trees stretched themselves in different styles, their trunks, roots, and bark each unique in the play of light and shadow. I felt as though these trees were speaking to me with their bodies—not through sound, but by simply revealing their presence.\n[1975-08-18 19:35:00] woods | I saw the giant spruce beside the stream, its thick, tangled roots extending far out. I observed how the spruce’s branches covered the depths, nearly black in color. I smelled the rich scent of sap within the bark. I saw the branches forming a pyramid shape downward, densely covered with deep green, tightly packed needles. I found it incredible how massive that tree was.\n[1975-08-18 19:40:00] woods | I saw pines rising like masts, their bark reddish. I noticed the oak behind the football field had a trunk as hard as stone, with a head-sized knothole in its center. I also saw thick, oil-green oak leaves hanging on the branches or piled on the ground like a russet-red carpet. I thought the canopy of oak leaves looked remarkably light and expansive. I realized that although the fallen leaves had softened on the ground, they were still beautiful.\n[1975-08-18 19:45:00] steep slope by the marshland | I reached the slope before the marshland and climbed up onto the elevated ground beneath a nameless large tree. I grabbed the hanging branches with both hands, trying to swing myself up—attempting twice. I saw four equally thick trunks supporting a dense canopy, their gray-green bark deeply grooved. A rope hung tied to one of the branches. I knew that rope was probably put there by the children from the other side of the road. I felt this tree possessed a subtle and barely perceptible beauty.\n[1975-08-18 19:50:00] steep slope by the marshland | I stood under the tree for a while, wondering what to do. I remained motionless there. I heard the owners of the house on the slope talking in their garden, the clinking of cutlery in my ears. In the distance, I also heard the drone of an airplane. I knew a couple and a child lived there. Though I could see nothing, I could sense the rhythm of my neighbors' lives.\n[1975-08-18 19:55:00] shaded hillside | I moved across the dry muddy ground, looking up. After watching the plane disappear behind the hill, I began running, entering the other side of the slope. I saw a white seaplane flashing blindingly in the sunlight. I felt the air here was noticeably cooler.\n[1975-08-18 20:00:00] path | I looked down at the path below. I ran along this trail. I proudly thought: No one could beat me in a race here. I could run this path blindfolded. I knew every stone, every depression, and every bush here. I found it deeply satisfying to precisely control where I placed my feet, and I tried to prolong this feeling of superiority.\n[1975-08-18 20:10:00] football field clearing | I stopped at the open ground beside the football field. I saw many children of different ages on the field, all running back and forth chasing a ball. I heard screams, shouts, and laughter echoing through the trees. I felt like those sounds resembled monkeys playing.\n[1975-08-18 20:15:00] football field | I saw the football field was a patch of dark, compacted earth. One side bordered a protruding cliff, the other side covered in stiff grass. At each end stood wooden goalposts without nets. I knew nearly all my dreams had originated here. I felt that running in circles on such a field was my greatest joy.\n[1975-08-18 20:15:10] football field | I shouted, \"Can I join?\"\n[1975-08-18 20:16:00] football field | I saw Helen Sengtong turn toward me. I heard Helen Stirling say, \"If you want, you can stand here as goalkeeper.\" I noticed every kicked ball bounced back from the cliff side.\n[1975-08-18 20:16:10] football field | I ran to the goal. I saw Helen Seng slowly walk away. I readily agreed, \"Okay.\" I heard Helen Sterng announce loudly, \"Grete Lundnes is our team's goalkeeper!\"\n[1975-08-18 20:20:00] football field | I positioned myself between the goalposts. I crouched down, caught the rolling ball, slapped it against the ground three times, then kicked it out. The ball struck my foot and arced in a parabola toward the right. I saw the ball was muddy-colored, worn thin with golden rubber showing through, large and soft to the touch. I found great joy in watching a group of children chase after the ball. I wasn't just following the players with my eyes—I was also silently distinguishing friend from foe in my heart.\n[1975-08-18 20:25:00] football field | I was happy being the goalkeeper. I especially loved that instant rush of diving forward to grab the ball. But I realized I had a problem: I could only dive to the left. Diving to the right seemed to defy natural law for me.\n[1975-08-18 20:30:00] football field | I noticed the players on the field began to slow down; some stopped and bent over, hands on their knees. I heard someone suggest, \"Let's stop playing—I have to go home.\" I saw the trees casting long shadows across the field, darkness now chasing after the children. I reluctantly realized the game was coming to an end.\n[1975-08-18 20:30:10] football field | My ears were filled with overlapping voices: \"Me too.\" \"I've got to go.\" \"I'm leaving.\"\n[1975-08-18 20:35:00] football field | I saw that within just a few minutes, the entire team had dispersed, leaving the field completely empty.",

    "text": "[1975-08-18 20:45:00] kitchen | I sat in the kitchen with my mother. I cut a piece of paper and pressed it under a book, folded the cover neatly, and taped it down. I saw that the book-covering paper my mother bought was translucent blue. I noticed the edges of the paper I cut were crooked; in the end, my mother had to trim them straight for me.\n[1975-08-18 21:00:00] kitchen | I sat there, watching my mother's knitting movements closely. I knew this was the Indian pattern I had chosen—white with dark brown edges. I also learned that the sweater would have side slits at the hem. I really liked the design of this sweater and followed its progress attentively. I realized my mother kept helping me adjust the book-covering paper throughout.\n[1975-08-18 21:10:00] home | I looked at the reddish-brown patterned curtains in the room, handmade by my mother. I glanced around at the bookshelves filled with books. I knew my mother was skilled at crafts—sewing, mending, embroidery, she could do it all. As far as I knew, none of the neighbors had a large bookshelf like ours. I also knew she had many kind female friends. I thought my mother looked very peaceful when she read during her free time. I really liked her friends.\n[1975-08-18 21:15:00] home / Zhens | I knew about Dagney’s friends, and Sven who drove the Citroën. I knew Marit and her children, Lars and Mariann. From what I understood, my father didn’t like their visits, so they rarely came over. I knew we would go to Zhens’ craft workshop to make Christmas gifts. I thought that whenever they did come, I’d get to enjoy being included and just sit with them.\n[1975-08-18 21:20:00] kitchen | I saw my mother tuck a long strand of hair behind her ear; her face looked serious yet gentle.\n[1975-08-18 21:20:10] kitchen | I told my mother, “Dalson saw a venomous snake somewhere! Right on the path down the cliff—he was running away! Luckily, the snake was scared too and crawled into the grass.” I heard my mother ask in surprise where exactly, then finally sigh, “That’s good.”\n[1975-08-18 21:25:00] kitchen | I saw my mother give a soft smile. I asked curiously, “Were there venomous snakes when you were little?” She shook her head and said there weren’t any in the western region. When I asked why, she replied it was probably too cold there.\n[1975-08-18 21:30:00] kitchen | I swung my legs back and forth, tapping my fingers on the table. I looked at my mother and brought up the mackerel. Humming a tune, I asked, “Kanestrøm caught so many mackerels today—I saw it myself. Do you think we’ll get a boat soon?”\n[1975-08-18 21:35:00] kitchen | I heard my mother laugh and say, “You’re asking for too much—both a boat and a cat! It’s something we can consider. But not this year, maybe next year? It costs money, you know. But you can go ahead and ask your father.” As soon as I heard the suggestion to 'ask your father,' I felt uneasy inside and thought, 'Sure, like that’s going to help.' But I didn’t say anything out loud.\n[1975-08-18 21:40:00] kitchen | I saw my mother hand me the scissors again. I tried to guide them forward smoothly, keeping them from veering downward. I was determined to cut it right this time, but the scissors jammed. I squeezed hard, and still, the edge came out crooked.\n[1975-08-18 21:45:00] kitchen | I saw my mother gazing anxiously out the window. I heard my mother say, \"Henrik Inge is late coming home again.\" I comforted her, saying, \"Someone will take care of him.\"\n[1975-08-18 21:50:00] kitchen | I watched my mother nod at me. I said to my mother, \"That form—for swimming lessons. Can you sign it for me now?\"\n[1975-08-18 21:55:00] hallway / room | I stood up and ran through the hallway, dashed into my room, and rummaged around looking for that note. Just as I was about to run back, I heard the front door opening downstairs. Since I had just been running inside the house, the sound of the door made my heart suddenly sink.\n[1975-08-18 21:55:10] staircase landing | I stood frozen outside the bathroom door, just in time to see my father's gaze rising from the lower landing, meeting my eyes directly. I heard heavy, firm footsteps on the stairs. I knew he was coming upstairs.\n[1975-08-18 21:55:20] staircase landing | I saw him standing in front of me, staring at me. I heard him scold, \"Don't run inside the house! How many times do I have to say this? The whole house shakes. Do you understand?\"\n[1975-08-18 21:55:25] staircase landing | I whispered, \"Yes.\"\n[1975-08-18 21:55:40] staircase landing / kitchen | I saw him walk past me into the kitchen, and I followed behind. I stared at his broad back beneath the white shirt, realizing all joy had vanished—but I knew I had to go in.\n[1975-08-18 21:56:00] kitchen | I saw my mother still sitting in her place. I saw my father looking out the window. I stepped forward and carefully placed the school note on the table. I said to them, \"Here it is.\"\n[1975-08-18 21:57:00] kitchen | I sat down and continued wrapping the remaining book. I saw my father still staring out the window. I heard my father ask, \"Henrik Inge hasn't come home yet?\" My mother replied, \"No, I'm starting to get a bit worried.\" I felt the silence all around, broken only by the movement of my hands.\n[1975-08-18 21:58:00] kitchen | I saw my father pick up the paper, read it, then grab the pen from the table, sign it, and hand it back to me. I heard my father ask, head lowered toward the table, \"What exactly did you bring me here?\" I told him it was the swimming lesson form.\n[1975-08-18 21:59:00] kitchen / bedroom | I stacked the books neatly and tucked the wrapping paper under my arm. Holding the scissors and tape, I walked back to my room. Just as I sat down to wrap the last book, I heard the sound of a bicycle rolling over gravel and a door opening below. I heard Dad command, 'Alright, now take all your things from down here and go up to your room. Dinner will be served here tonight.' I responded, 'Yes, Dad.'\n[1975-08-18 22:00:00] hallway / bedroom | I placed the book on the cut wrapping paper and pressed it down with another book, trying to tear off a piece of tape from the roll. I heard Dad ask sharply in the hallway, 'What's the meaning of this?' I heard Henrik Inge mumble a few words in reply. I knew Dad was standing in the hallway waiting for my brother to come upstairs.\n[1975-08-18 22:05:00] bedroom | I saw Henrik Inge push open my door and walk in. I told him I was wrapping books. I heard my brother ask, 'What are you doing?' I heard him excitedly talk about post-training snacks and the girls on the team, and praise Coach Fredrik, saying what a great guy he was.\n[1975-08-18 22:10:00] bedroom window | I finished taping the book, then walked over to the window and looked down. I saw Karl Larsdal and Toya Moen standing by the roadside talking. Then Karl ran into his own driveway. I heard faint voices and footsteps coming from the slope road. I noticed that when Karl turned, there was a slight smile on his lips and his hands were clenched in fists tucked into his pockets—a sight that left a strong impression on me.\n[1975-08-18 22:15:00] bedroom / kitchen | I turned around and asked Henrik Inge what position he played. Then I heard Dad calling us for dinner, so we both stepped out of the room. I heard my brother say he'd definitely play defender. When I asked about the jersey color, he said it was the same as Tromsø IL—blue and white. Then I heard Dad shout from the kitchen, 'Dinner!'\n[1975-08-18 22:20:00] kitchen / living room | We entered the kitchen and saw plates with bread and glasses of milk already set at the table. I saw Mom and Dad sitting in the living room watching TV. I looked out the window and saw the gray pavement and dark branches, but beyond the bay, the blue sky stretched wide and endless, as if it didn't belong to this world.",

    "text": "[1975-08-19 07:00:00] bedroom | The next morning, I saw Dad push open the door and wake me up. I heard Dad shout loudly, 'Wake up, jump out of bed, you little sleepyhead! The sun is shining bright and the birds are singing!'\n[1975-08-19 07:05:00] bedroom | I threw off the covers and got out of bed. I heard Dad’s aimless footsteps in the hallway. I walked to the wardrobe to pick out clothes and pulled out my best pure white shirt. I felt the entire house silent and still. I knew Mom had already gone to work and my brother had left early for school. I thought if I wore my best shirt, Dad might start asking questions, thinking I was dressing too extravagantly, so in the end I decided to change into my white Adidas tracksuit instead.\n[1975-08-19 07:10:00] bathroom | I carried my clothes into the bathroom, urinated, wiped up a few drops that had landed on the floor with toilet paper, and then pressed the flush button. I saw a few transparent drops of urine on the gray-blue vinyl floor. I heard the water in the toilet gurgle and bubble. I was glad my brother hadn’t left his washing water behind. I closed the door carefully, trying not to make too much noise.\n[1975-08-19 07:15:00] bathroom | I stood at the sink, cupped cold water in my hands, and splashed my face. I quickly lathered soap onto my hands and scrubbed, then dried off with the brownish-yellow towel hanging on the hook. I saw the water in the sink was slightly greenish. I felt a chill run down my spine as the cold water touched my skin.\n[1975-08-19 07:20:00] bedroom window / kitchen | I pulled back the curtain and looked outside, then got dressed and walked into the kitchen. I saw my plate and a carton of milk already set out on the table, and Dad was moving around in the living room. I saw the morning sun rising from behind the trees, casting deep shadows across the road.\n[1975-08-19 07:25:00] kitchen | I sat down, poured milk into my bowl, and took a big spoonful. Suddenly I felt a sour taste fill my mouth, and I silently cursed. I realized the milk had gone bad, but seeing Dad walking in, I forced myself to swallow it down, afraid he’d notice me dumping food.\n[1975-08-19 07:30:00] kitchen | I watched as Dad went to the cupboard for his own plate and spoon, then sat down across from me. I saw him open the cardboard box with the red-and-green rooster and pour cornflakes into his bowl. I heard him say: \"I'll have some too.\" I saw that Dad didn’t notice anything strange at all, and I felt extremely tense, having to keep pretending everything was normal as I continued eating.\n[1975-08-19 07:31:00] kitchen | I saw Dad shovel a large spoonful into his mouth, and immediately his face twisted up—he spat it all back into the bowl before even chewing. I heard him shout angrily: \"Damn it! The milk's sour! Oh, damn it all!\" I froze, realizing the disaster had finally erupted.\n[1975-08-19 07:32:00] kitchen | I saw Dad staring at me. I saw confusion in his eyes, as if he were seeing me for the first time in his life. I heard him ask incredulously: \"You actually swallowed cornflakes with sour milk?\" I nodded at him. I knew I would never forget the look in his eyes for the rest of my life. I realized he wasn't angry, and that surprised me deeply.\n[1975-08-19 07:35:00] kitchen | I watched him stand up, pour the sour milk into the sink, throw away the carton, then take a new carton from the fridge. He washed my plate clean and placed it back in front of me. I heard him say: \"You can't do that, you know! You'll get fresh milk—okay? Now go ahead and pour in your cornflakes and milk again. OK?\" I answered: \"Yes.\" I saw him pour himself another bowl. Then we finished breakfast together in silence.\n[1975-08-19 10:00:00] classroom | I saw the principal leave the classroom after greeting us. The female teacher stood by the window, hands behind her back, smiling gently at us. I learned that on the second day of school, the principal came to explain school rules, and the teacher mentioned he would tell us about salvaging a sunken ship.\n[1975-09-02 10:00:00] classroom | I saw the photos the principal showed us—him in wet clothes, carrying a scuba tank. I also saw the ivory he had brought up. I learned the wreck was actually only a few meters underwater. I had been eager to hear this story, but when I found out the shipwreck lay in such shallow water, reachable by any ordinary boy’s dive, I felt disappointed. In my imagination, the seabed should have been profoundly dark and deep.\n[1975-09-05 19:00:00] home | I knew Dad had once done a radio interview about a stamp exhibition, but I came home too late to hear it. As far as I knew, he nearly appeared on TV news once—our whole family waited two days but never saw him.\n[1975-09-06 10:00:00] above construction site | I saw a few dry leaves swirling in the air. Karl Larsdal and I, carrying snacks and juice, were walking up toward the area above the construction site. I felt the heat, the dusty haze drifting across the deep blue sky. I noticed a hint of autumn already in the early September air. My face was covered in glistening sweat from the stifling warmth. I wanted to check out that legendary path branching off to the left near the gas station trail.\n[1975-09-06 10:10:00] the edge of a certain area | We followed the stream toward the path. I saw that one side of the path was a cliff, and the other side was the stream. I remembered being shouted at by a homeowner, fists waving, for playing ball here in spring. I knew as long as we didn't wander off, simply passing through should be fine.\n[1975-09-06 10:20:00] White Peak | I saw a white mountain peak shining in the sunlight appear ahead. We pushed open a gate and stopped before the mountain. I found it was a narrow path covered with white pebbles. Tall trees lined both sides of the trail, dense like a tunnel. I noticed the mountain peak was strangely smooth, almost glassy, made up of many sloping planes. I realized we had discovered a place we'd never been to before.\n[1975-09-06 10:30:00] White Peak / Stream | I filled my pockets with white stones. We continued walking downstream along the stream. I saw the stream flowing down the mountainside in steps toward a deep gorge. I knew this area was near residential construction zones, so it was unlikely anyone hadn’t already discovered a gemstone vein here. I wondered in my mind: Could this be the gemstone vein we’ve been searching for?\n[1975-09-06 11:00:00] beside the stream | We ran down the path. I saw the stream spilling onto the trail, held back by the makeshift dam we’d built. Suddenly, a sharp gunshot rang out nearby. Karl and I exchanged glances. I thought—could someone be hunting nearby?\n[1975-09-06 11:10:00] edge of the landfill | We moved through the woods, climbing a small hill. I saw below us, about twenty meters away, a vast open space piled high with garbage. Another burst of gunshots echoed there. I saw the open area fully exposed to sunlight. Again, I heard muffled, cracking gunfire, like explosions. I realized we had discovered a landfill hidden among the trees. I sensed the gunshots were coming from the left, and I began to feel uneasy.\n[1975-09-06 11:15:00] landfill | I saw two men holding guns standing beside the garbage pile. They fired every few seconds, then stepped across the trash and walked away. I saw seagulls screeching and circling above the landfill. I smelled a sickly sweet, irritating stench of decay that pierced my nostrils. Looking at those seagulls, I felt as if this open space was like an ocean in their eyes.\n[1975-09-06 11:20:00] landfill | We walked toward the spot where the two men had stood. I looked around and saw piles everywhere—junk cars, refrigerators, TVs, sofas, and all kinds of furniture. There were countless old skis, bicycles, and bloated plastic bags. I saw the garbage mounds uneven and rolling, like a desolate ruin. I realized this was where all the household waste from the entire residential area had been dumped. The sight deeply shocked me.\n[1975-09-06 11:25:00] landfill | I saw one of them swing a dead rat by its tail in circles a few times, then toss it aside. The rat landed in a crevice between distant plastic bags. I watched the other man kick another dead rat away. I heard Karl Larsdal whisper, 'They're shooting rats—look over there!' I heard the men laughing. I noticed one side of the rat’s body was already crushed, nearly unrecognizable.\n[1975-09-06 11:30:00] landfill | I saw the two men walking toward us, one wearing a blue sunhat and sporting a red mustache. I heard the red-bearded man greet us, 'Out for a stroll, kids?' The other blond man laughed, 'Wandered all the way to the dump! Are you going to eat your lunch on the garbage heap?' We smiled back at them. I saw the bright sunlight forcing them to squint their eyes. I thought these two men looked very much like brothers.\n[1975-09-06 11:35:00] landfill | We obediently stood behind them. I heard one of them ask, 'We’re shooting rats—would you like to watch?' Karl answered quickly, 'Yes, we’d love to.' The man warned us to stay quiet and not disturb them. We nodded repeatedly.\n[1975-09-06 11:40:00] junkyard | I saw the two men lying on the ground, motionless as they aimed. With the first gunshot, I saw a rat nearby torn open instantly, as if ripped apart. I felt as though a sudden gust of wind swept through the air. I tried hard to see what they were aiming at.\n[1975-09-06 11:45:00] junkyard | I saw the rat was not yet dead, writhing in pain on the ground. I saw the man smash the butt of his gun into the rat’s head; with a 'crack,' blood and flesh splattered. He then looked somewhat disgustedly at the now-dirty gunstock. I heard them stand up and ask if we wanted to come over. Both Karl and I said we did. I heard the blond man mock his companion for being too brutal, telling him to go wipe the gunstock by the car. I saw that the rear half of the rat had been blown off, and it made me feel uneasy.\n[1975-09-06 11:50:00] junkyard | We jogged behind them. I heard the man ask whether our parents knew about us being here. I lied and said yes. Then he warned us, 'So they must’ve told you not to pick things up here, right? This place is full of bacteria. Understand?' I replied, 'Yes.' Then I heard them say goodbye to us.\n[1975-09-06 12:00:00] junkyard | After their car drove away, we ran wildly around the junkyard, flipping through cabinets and bags. I found a plastic bag filled with old magazines, including all kinds of comics I really wanted to read. Karl also found a flashlight and some small items. We later sat on the heather ground eating snacks. Seeing that bag of magazines, I was absolutely overjoyed.\n[1975-09-06 12:10:00] edge of the junkyard | I saw Karl crumple a piece of paper and throw it forcefully toward the garbage pile. The paper ball landed lightly on the heather. I heard Karl suddenly suggest, 'Let’s take a shit, what do you say?' I readily agreed, 'Sure, where?' I felt a gentle breeze passing by just then.",

    "text": "[1975-09-06 12:20:00] woods | We searched the woods for a suitable spot. I climbed onto a fallen pine trunk, pulled down my pants, gripped the log tightly, and stuck my butt out. I watched my poop fall straight down. I heard Karl point at the droppings hanging from the trunk and burst into laughter: 'See that!' I couldn’t help but laugh along with him. I thought of the poop falling like bombs dropped from an airplane, and found the whole thing incredibly fun. I realized that watching it hang there and then drop off gave me an oddly satisfying thrill.\n[1975-09-06 12:30:00] woods | I was used to holding in my bowel movements for several days. I realized this built up the urge even more, and when I finally let go, my entire body would feel a wonderfully liberating pleasure. That sense of calm made me want to stay sitting there forever.\n[1975-09-06 12:40:00] woods | I remembered the intense pain sometimes caused by overly hard stools—the bursting sensation scared me. I thought about how I’d once tried using my fingers to help push it out. Though it worked, the lingering stench on my fingertips annoyed me. I kept weighing the pros and cons of this method in my mind.\n[1975-09-06 12:50:00] woods | I saw Karl stirring my poop with a stick. Immediately, several shiny green flies swirled over. I suggested we should leave. I heard Karl pinch his nose and shout in disgust, 'Ah, damn, that’s disgusting!' I shot back that his own shit smelled worse. Before leaving, I asked if he wanted to come back next week. He said he’d be going to Risør to see boats. I noticed my poop was mixed with green and somewhat soft. Karl’s looked drier and light brown.\n[1975-09-06 13:10:00] on the way home | I carried the plastic bag full of magazines, watching Karl Larsdal hold a car wheel as we ran home together. I made Karl swear not to tell anyone where we’d been once we got home. I knew my family wouldn’t allow us to go there if they found out. I had already made up a story—if Dad asked about the magazines, I’d say I borrowed them from Jon who lived in another district.\n[1975-09-06 13:30:00] hallway at home | I walked into the hallway and stood quietly for a moment, bent down to untie my shoelaces, and placed my shoes neatly against the wall. Dad appeared before me, pushing open the second door, so I showed him the bag. I watched him flip through it, take out a paperback copy of Tex Willer, and walk back into his office. I heard Dad ask, 'Where have you been?' I stared at the floor and answered, 'In the woods... then up on the high ridge.' Then I heard him ask what was in the bag, and I told him they were borrowed magazines. I suddenly remembered the excuse I had prepared earlier, mentally calculating how to make the lie sound more natural.\n[1975-09-06 13:35:00] foot of the stairs | I was about to go upstairs when I heard Dad call me, so I turned and walked back down. I saw him standing in the open doorway, placing a five-kroner coin in my hand. I heard Dad say, 'You haven't taken your weekly allowance yet.' I said, 'Ah, thanks!' He also told me the supermarket was closed, and if I wanted sweets, I could go to the Finna gas station down below. I worried whether he had discovered something—maybe even that he could smell the landfill on the books. My legs felt weak and wobbly, as if I could barely stand.\n[1975-09-06 14:00:00] path to the gas station | I headed toward the Finna gas station, walking the long downhill stretch, across grassy fields and forest paths, finally onto the gravel road leading to the highway. Houses surrounded me, with cars and pedestrians on both sides. Deep along the path, it was silent—only leaves, bushes, fallen wood, and occasional marshes. I found the gas station both wonderful and hateful. To me, the path was the worst place—once I stepped just a few meters into it, I vanished into the woods, completely cut off from any sign of people.\n[1975-09-06 14:10:00] the path | I walked along the path, singing loudly. When I wasn’t singing, I talked to myself, muttering about the Knox and Fox candies I wanted to buy. I heard myself sing, 'A little blue bird is flying...' I also muttered to myself, 'Could someone be living on the other side?' I knew we lived on an island, so there must be ocean somewhere. I imagined perhaps Baywick’s ferry was crossing the sea right now. I felt that when I sang, I wasn’t alone anymore—the songs were like another boy keeping me company. In my mind, I kept repeating the names of the candies over and over.\n[1975-09-06 14:20:00] the path | I noticed beneath the tall deciduous trees to the right, the dense canopy formed an open room-like space, leaving the understory vegetation very sparse.\n[1975-09-06 14:30:00] Finna gas station | I walked up the gravel road, past the white old house and the red old grain silo. I stopped fifty meters from the gas station, looking at the four fuel pumps. I saw a truck parked there, the driver leaning out to talk to someone below. I heard the distant whoosh of cars passing on the main road. The gas station loomed ahead, impressive and grand, with a huge white plastic sign flashing the word 'Finna' in blue. Three mopeds were parked outside the convenience store. I felt as though the four fuel pumps were raising their hands, waving at me like greetings.\n[1975-09-06 14:35:00] beside the gas pump at the gas station | I stopped in front of a man who was refueling. I stared at the rapidly changing numbers on the pump screen. I observed the man—he performed every movement without needing to look down. I heard the pump humming and roaring. The man pulled a thick wallet from his pocket and handled the nozzle with practiced ease. The numbers on the screen seemed like faces blinking wildly. I realized he was completely accustomed to this routine, and I was deeply impressed.\n[1975-09-06 14:40:00] gas station convenience store | I walked toward the store and reached out to push the door open. My heart pounded—I didn’t know what awaited me behind that door. I was especially afraid someone might make fun of me or my dad, turning me into a laughingstock.\n[1975-09-06 14:45:00] gas station convenience store | I noticed most of the customers were lower secondary school kids. Some wore leather jackets with Ferrari logos stitched on, their hair long enough to cover their eyes, flicking their heads sharply now and then. I saw some spitting, others drinking cola, smoke drifting through the air. I knew the younger ones rode bicycles, the older ones motorcycles. I learned some even poured peanuts into their cola bottles to eat. I watched the way they tied their bandanas and moved.\n[1975-09-06 14:50:00] gas station convenience store | I kept my head low and darted like an arrow straight to the counter to buy my things. I imagined them shouting at me, 'Little Grete Lundnes is scared!' Everything here represented 'evil' to me. Their laughter was the most hateful thing in my nightmares—I couldn’t bear to stay here a single moment longer.\n[1975-09-06 14:55:00] gas station convenience store | I used all my money to buy a huge pile of Fox and Knox candies, took the transparent bag from the cashier, and hurried out. I noticed a few girls sitting at the farthest table, giggling quietly. I saw three boys standing by the arcade machine, and four others sitting around a table drinking Coca-Cola. I was glad they hadn't picked on me this time.\n[1975-09-06 15:10:00] path | I walked up the gravel road and re-entered the path. As I walked, I kept thinking about my candy-eating strategy. I heard myself say, 'This journey seems to be going smoothly enough.' I muttered indecisively, 'Should I eat one of each kind, or finish one type first?' I felt the sun no longer shining; the air had turned cool. I secretly celebrated how well my earlier adventure had gone.\n[1975-09-06 15:15:00] path | I suddenly stopped dead in my tracks, staring fixedly at the bushes to my right. For safety, I stepped backward a few paces. I tried calling out, but no one answered. I asked cautiously, 'Hey? Is someone there?' A rustling sound reached my ears. My heart pounded: What could have made that noise?\n[1975-09-06 15:20:00] path | I bent down, grabbed a stone, and hurled it hard into the bushes, then ran up the hill as fast as I could. I stopped to make sure nothing was following me. I shouted with a laugh, 'I'll beat you to death!' Seeing nothing behind me, I couldn't help laughing.\n[1975-09-06 15:30:00] path | I pushed myself forward, feeling my heart pounding wildly beneath my chest. I thought the most important thing about dead people is not to think about them. I realized that once I started imagining ghosts, fear would swirl through my entire body, as if I could see them hiding behind the pine trees.",

    "text": "[1975-09-06 15:40:00] construction area lawn | I stepped out of the path and saw the lawn of the construction area spread out before me. I felt only now did my mind finally relax completely.\n[1975-09-06 15:45:00] construction area lawn | I began jogging across the field. Before me stretched a crystal-clear, bright sky, with a hint of gray smudged between the distant houses.\n[1975-09-06 15:46:00] construction area lawn | Walking across the grass, I noticed two girls ahead staring at me, then they started running toward me. The two girls had originally been standing outside a house by the roadside.\n[1975-09-06 15:46:10] construction area lawn | I looked at them but didn't stop walking forward, until they blocked my way. I wondered nervously what they were trying to do.\n[1975-09-06 15:46:20] construction area lawn | I recognized one of them as Tom's younger sister; the other girl was someone I'd never seen before. I knew Tom was famous in this neighborhood—he owned a shiny red car.\n[1975-09-06 15:47:00] lawn near the buildings | I prepared to walk around them and leave. I heard one of them ask, 'Where did you go?' I answered, 'To the Fina gas station.' The other pressed on, asking what for, and I said, 'Nothing.'\n[1975-09-06 15:47:30] lawn near the buildings | I watched as they shifted positions, blocking my way out. I heard them demanding what was in my bag. I lied and said it was nothing. But they shouted, 'We saw—it's Fox and Knox.' In desperation, I said I'd bought them for my eleven-year-old brother, but then they actually told me to give them the candy. I felt tension rising involuntarily and quietly refused them.\n[1975-09-06 15:48:00] lawn near the buildings | I saw Tom's sister grab the bag, and I quickly twisted it away. Another girl reached out and shoved me to the ground. I lay there clutching the bag tightly with both arms, struggling to get back up. I heard the girl who pushed me command, 'Give me the bag.' I shouted back, 'No.'\n[1975-09-06 15:48:30] lawn near the buildings | She shoved me again, and I crashed hard onto the ground, helplessly watching as they snatched the bag and ran off toward the road, laughing. I sat there crying. I screamed hysterically, 'They're mine! You can't take them!' I heard one of them mock, 'So I guess it's not your brother's after all?'\n[1975-09-06 15:49:00] lawn near the buildings | I yelled at their retreating backs as they fled. I shouted, 'They're mine! They're mine!'\n[1975-09-06 15:55:00] on my way home | I sobbed as I walked home. I thought about how I had used the money Dad gave me to run so far just to buy that candy, and I felt utterly wronged. I kept asking myself over and over: How could this happen? How could they just take my things like that? I felt a despair born of being bullied.\n[1975-09-06 15:58:00] in front of the house | As I neared home, I wiped my face fiercely with my sleeve, blinked rapidly several times, and shook my head. I thought this would hide the traces of my crying so my family wouldn’t notice.\n[1975-09-06 15:58:10] in front of the house | I recalled the time when Wenke threw stones at me when I was five. As far as I knew, Dad didn’t help me then—he even said I couldn’t even fight off a little girl, which made me feel deeply ashamed. At the time, I completely didn’t understand why Dad wanted me to hit back. In my heart, I wondered—wasn’t fighting back something even worse?\n[1975-09-06 15:58:20] by the yard fence | I remembered how Dad stood there with his arms crossed, his gaze extremely stern, only nodding for me to get out and play and stop bothering him. I knew Dad’s thinking was different from mine—he cared only that I didn’t act like a coward.\n[1975-09-06 16:00:00] at home / Henrik Inge's room | I paused in the hallway, listening for sounds, then took off my shoes and placed them neatly. I tiptoed carefully upstairs and slipped into my brother’s room. Thinking of the lost candy, tears fell again. I realized it was girls who stole the candy—Dad definitely wouldn’t care. Just thinking about those Fox and Knox candies made me ache with sorrow.\n[1975-09-06 16:05:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw Henrik Inge lying face down on the bed with his legs crossed, a bag of candy piled beside him next to a magazine. I heard my brother ask, \"Why are you crying?\" He was reading a publication titled *The Nemesis*.\n[1975-09-06 16:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I sobbed as I recounted what had just happened. I heard my brother ask, \"Well, couldn't you just run away?\" I cried and explained that they had blocked my path. When he suggested I push back, I replied, \"No, they're much older and stronger than me.\"\n[1975-09-06 16:15:00] Henrik Inge's room | I wiped my tears and sat down, taking a few candies from his hand and putting them in my mouth. I heard my brother say, \"You don't need to cry over this.\" He offered to share some candy with me. I nodded, and as he counted them out, he handed me a few pieces. I asked if I could stay here to eat them, and he agreed—but told me to leave once I was done. I felt much better and was grateful toward him.\n[1975-09-06 17:00:00] Home | I washed my face with cold water. I stayed upstairs, making sure I didn't hear any sound from Dad. I heard the kitchen exhaust fan humming; Mom was busy working in there. I felt refreshed. I thought Dad must be in his office downstairs—that made me feel at ease.\n[1975-09-06 17:05:00] Kitchen | I walked into the kitchen and took a seat on a chair, watching Mom standing by the stove stirring meat in a frying pan. I heard another pot bubbling nearby. I heard Mom ask, \"Did you buy your Saturday candy?\" The noise of the exhaust fan echoed in my ears, along with the sizzling from the frying pan.\n[1975-09-06 17:10:00] Kitchen | I answered that I had. I heard her ask if I'd gone to 'Fina Service Station.' I casually asked what we were having for dinner. She told me it was Mexican-style stewed meat and rice. I also asked whether we'd add pineapple. I noticed Mom always formally used the full name of that place.\n[1975-09-06 17:15:00] Kitchen | I watched Mom efficiently season the meat, measure water into a pot, and pour rice into the boiling water. I saw her sit down on the chair across from me and rub her lower back. I could sense that Mom was already tired after a long day's work.\n[1975-09-06 17:20:00] Kitchen | I curiously asked, \"What exactly do you do at the auxiliary therapy center?\" Mom reminded me I'd actually been there several times. I asked her why she had to take care of those people, and why they couldn't live at home.\n[1975-09-06 17:25:00] Kitchen | I watched Mom fall into thought, then shake her head. I heard her explain that the people there suffered from phobias. I heard Mom say, \"A phobia is when you're afraid of something, but you don't even know what it is.\" I asked if they were afraid all the time. She nodded and said, \"Yes, that's why I talk to them, so they won't be so afraid anymore.\" Actually, I was already thinking about something else by then and didn't really care about her silence.\n[1975-09-06 17:30:00] Kitchen | I pressed on, \"So they're just afraid?\" Mom answered yes, and added that once they recovered, they could move back home.\n[1975-09-06 17:35:00] kitchen | I explained that it was because the teacher had asked us to talk about our parents' jobs, so that's why I'd asked. I heard Mom ask if I'd been through something recently. I also repeated what Karl had said, about how his mom taught people to tie their shoes. Actually, I wasn't entirely clear on the specific details of my mom's job.\n[1975-09-06 17:40:00] kitchen | I watched Mom get up and stir the vegetables in the pot. I heard Mom patiently explain that some people have difficulties with housework or dressing themselves, so Marthe helps them with those things.\n[1975-09-06 17:41:00] kitchen | I asked if they were 'Mongos.' I heard Mom stare at me seriously and tell me it was called Down syndrome, and that 'Mongos' was an offensive term. I mumbled in response.",

I tried not to break into a run. I told Mom, 'I'm going over to Henrik Inge's for a bit.' I thought I absolutely had to hide in the room before Dad came upstairs, otherwise he'd start questioning me again.\n[1975-09-06 18:01:00] Henrik Inge's room | I had just closed the door when I heard Dad step onto the first stair. I saw my brother lying on the bed reading a football magazine. I went over and sat down on the chair. My brother asked if dinner was almost ready. I nodded, then asked, 'Can I borrow one of your magazines?' He reminded me to take good care of it. I was glad I'd made it into the room ahead of Dad.\n[1975-09-06 18:05:00] Henrik Inge's room | I bent down in front of the bookshelf, rummaging through a large stack of picture magazines. I wanted to borrow the whole folder, but was refused, so in the end I took just a single issue. I heard Dad's footsteps pass by. I heard my brother say firmly, 'Bring it back as soon as you're done!' I learned he was a member of the Phantom Club and liked keeping his Phantom comics neatly stored in folders, while I always tossed mine around carelessly.\n[1975-09-06 19:00:00] dining room | The table was set with each person's napkin neatly in place. I saw Dad and Mom drinking wine, while we drank Blue Sky soda. I learned about the Saturday routine: cold rice porridge for breakfast, and a formal dinner in the dining room in the evening. I knew that after dinner usually meant watching TV together as a family.\n[1975-09-06 20:00:00] living room | Broadway-style performances played on TV, with actors in tights and suits. I saw Solvi Wang, Mom's favorite, appear on stage. I knew that Saturday night TV typically featured variety sketches, the annual song contest, and sports events—these were highlights throughout the year. I also recognized regulars on the show like Leif, Alv, and others.\n[1975-09-06 21:00:00] bedroom | I hummed 'Oul man rivå' all evening, whether brushing my teeth, undressing, or finally lying in bed. I heard a ragged man sitting on a rooftop on TV singing that song in an extremely deep voice. That melody kept circling in my mind.\n[1975-09-06 22:00:00] living room / bedroom | I saw Mom and Dad close the sliding doors; they sat in the living room chatting, smoking, listening to music, and finishing the leftover wine from dinner. In between songs, I heard Dad mutter complaints under his breath, while Mom calmly responded—but I couldn't make out what they were saying.\n[1975-09-07 02:00:00] bedroom | I fell asleep, and when I woke up again, I saw they were still talking inside. null null null I wondered to myself—were they planning to talk all night long?\n[1975-09-10 12:00:00] in front of Helen Ster's house | At noon, I got off the bus and followed Helen Ster home with Karl Larsdal. We climbed up to his balcony and dropped our backpacks onto plastic chairs. I heard Helen invite us upstairs for juice. He opened the door and shouted into the house: 'Mom, we want juice! Some classmates from my class are here!' Before me stretched a bright blue sky and dry roads where dust swirled in the air. null null\n[1975-09-10 12:10:00] Helen Ster's balcony | I saw his mother step out through the door and disappear into the living room, then behind another door. I heard her say: 'How lovely! I'll check and get you some juice.' I noticed his mother was wearing a white bikini, large sunglasses covering half her face, and deeply tanned skin. His living room looked somewhat empty, with no pictures on the walls. null null\n[1975-09-10 12:15:00] Helen Ster's balcony | I saw two girls from our class passing below, and Helen Ster bent down and shouted at them. I noticed that Marianna was taller than all the boys. Karl and I burst out laughing. I heard Helen yelling after them, calling them a pair of monkeys. I noticed Marianna had a high forehead, high cheekbones, and long light hair falling like curtains on either side of her cheeks. null I saw the girls ignore him and keep walking. I liked watching the little wrinkles that appeared on Marianna’s forehead when she thought.\n[1975-09-10 12:20:00] Helen Ster's balcony | I saw Helen Ster’s mother come out carrying a tray, pouring iced juice into each of our glasses. I heard Helen suddenly burst into loud laughter and say: 'Were you looking at my mom’s ass?' I saw the bright red juice, the ice cubes tightly packed and pressing against each other. null I noticed his mother’s skin was deeply tanned. I thought to myself that although she wasn’t beautiful, there was something undeniably striking about her.\n[1975-09-10 12:20:10] Helen Ster's balcony | I saw Helen’s mother come over and slap him lightly on the cheek. I felt deeply embarrassed and shouted: 'No, I wasn't looking!' I heard Helen continue laughing and call his mother over. He said to her: 'Grete Lundnes was looking at your ass!' null null I didn’t understand why he would say that. I worried she might hear his shouting.\n[1975-09-10 12:25:00] Helen Ster's balcony / room | I followed Helen through a dark hallway into his room. I saw motorcycle posters on the wall and a nearly nude woman on a poster. I heard Helen still laughing, introducing the poster: 'That’s a Kawasaki 750.' Then he asked if we wanted more juice. null null I saw Karl Larsdal whistling into the air, clearly embarrassed too.\n[1975-09-10 12:30:00] Helen Ster's room / outside the door | We left the room and walked away amid the barking of the dog. I saw Helen waving to us from the balcony, and Karl waved back. I declined: 'I think not—I have to go home for lunch.' Karl echoed my words. null null I didn’t say a word as I walked down the stairs.\n[1975-09-10 12:40:00] on the way home | null null null null I kept wondering: Why would I look at his mother’s ass? I felt uneasy—it wasn’t right, especially since she was almost naked, but I really hadn’t looked. And I kept thinking: how could he still laugh after she slapped him?\n[1975-09-10 12:50:00] on the way home | null null null I knew this was the first and last time I’d visit Helen’s house. Though he was in my class, he wasn’t someone I could confide in. I knew he often hung out with older boys and even dared to challenge teachers. As far as I knew, Helen had more 'uncles' at home than anyone else. I realized that even though people said he only seemed tough, deep down I knew he truly was—and we were all a little afraid of him.\n[1975-09-15 08:00:00] in front of the supermarket / bus | I saw Karl Larsdal come to ring my doorbell. We walked toward the supermarket and lined up our backpacks to claim seats on the bus. I love watching the children from old Tibaken and all over the hills gradually gather in small groups in front of the store.\n[1975-09-15 08:00:00] Tibaken | I noticed that the warm days of September were summer’s final struggle, and the temperature would suddenly drop. I had to switch to sweaters and long pants, and wear a coat in the mornings. When the rainy season arrived, I could only wear rubber boots and a raincoat.\n[1975-09-15 08:10:00] in front of the supermarket | Ingeborg had shiny black hair and sparkling dark eyes, with large, red lips. I especially enjoyed looking at Ingeborg. I felt she was always so joyful, as if her body was filled with endless happiness, which made me feel happy too.\n[1975-09-15 08:10:00] Tibaken | I saw the stream overflowing with rainwater, and puddles of varying depths everywhere on the road. The rushing water swept away mud, sand, and pinecones, carrying everything far away. People at the dock were now busy fishing. I realized outdoor swimming was completely over; no one went out boating anymore.\n[1975-09-15 08:15:00] in front of the supermarket | Lilund had a face full of freckles and pale skin. As far as I knew, Ingeborg’s close friend was Lilund, and they were always inseparable. I knew their family lived in the uppermost residential area of Tibaken, and I also heard that Ingeborg had a younger sister and a younger brother. I noticed that although Lilund didn’t talk much, her eyes were very gentle.\n[1975-09-15 08:20:00] in front of the supermarket | I heard Vimd proudly say his father had hemophilia. He explained it meant that once bleeding started, it couldn’t be stopped, and he might die. I saw Vimd’s father was thin and pale, needing to walk with a cane. His mother, on the other hand, was large-built with a shrill voice. I knew Vimd was somewhat overweight, not good at reading but loved drawing. I learned his family lived at the very top. It was said his constitution was weak—even the way he threw things looked girlish.",

He would wait there for hours, hoping to catch a big cod. I knew winter was the season for cod fishing, and I also saw Dad pull out his full set of fishing gear.\n[1975-09-15 08:30:00] various parts of Tibaken | From the top of the hill, I could see the lawn in Hagenlund’s garden, where a five-meter-high white wall and green hedges stood. I realized that with the start of school, many children who were once strangers suddenly entered my life. I learned where Karin Ingrid, Kristine Lof, and others lived, and discovered that the world wasn’t as closed off as I had imagined. I found it amazing that areas that once seemed independent suddenly became connected - this feeling struck me as truly wonderful.\n[1975-09-15 08:30:00] school | I learned swimming lessons would take place every Tuesday evening. As far as I knew, everyone in the class had signed up, and we needed to go to the swimming pool on the other side of the bay for practice. I thought it felt a bit strange to go to an indoor pool when it was freezing cold outside.\n[1975-09-15 08:40:00] school | Nilssen had tape covering his eyeglass lenses. Mariann was stronger than most boys. I learned Sølvi was so shy she barely spoke, Winnie’s whole family sold vegetables at the market, and Karl Larsdal had been thought unlikely to survive at birth. I knew Lilund was good at drawing, and Helen Ster had many uncles. I realized each person had their own world and unique story—these new details fascinated me deeply.\n[1975-09-15 10:00:00] school | In class, I learned that it was true Jesus walked on water and that God appeared in a burning bush. I also learned that diseases are caused by tiny microorganisms. As far as I knew, everything in the world was made up of invisible particles too small for the eye to see. I felt school days were all the same. I gradually became convinced that school would never surprise me with anything new again.\n[1975-09-15 10:00:00] school | I knew many teachers were my father’s colleagues, so they all recognized me. I realized they had initially been confused by my name because calling me was like calling him. I really enjoyed this feeling. I wanted to be the best in class, so my father would hear how outstanding I was.\n[1975-09-15 10:05:00] school | I deeply loved going to school. In my heart, I marveled at how much I cherished everything that happened at school, and how each room carried its own stories.\n[1975-09-15 10:10:00] school | I saw the teachers with their gray-streaked hair and neatly pressed suits. I knew many of them had been teaching for thirty or forty years. I realized they valued profound knowledge we could barely grasp, yet seemed indifferent to whether they got our names right.\n[1975-09-15 10:10:00] classroom | I watched white chalk flow from the teacher's hand, forming various letters. I saw the wet sponge wipe the blackboard clean, which minutes later turned dark green again. I saw the old seats with iron pipe legs in the classroom, desks pockmarked and faded. I noticed the sponge bloating and changing color in the sink. Seeing a clean blackboard gave me a special kind of joy.\n[1975-09-15 10:20:00] classroom | When the female teacher asked us something, I saw classmates raising their hands, and I vigorously waved my own back and forth, eager to get a chance to speak. I heard the woman teacher ask us questions in a Kamøy accent. I also heard classmates shouting 'Me, me, me!' in a rush. I knew we weren't allowed to speak freely in class—only when called upon by the teacher. I realized so many hands shot up because the question wasn’t difficult.\n[1975-09-15 10:30:00] school playground / hallway | I saw children gathering and scattering during break time, one game after another unfolding. I smelled the green soap near the coat hooks, the urine odor in the toilets, and the scent rising from the milk cabinet. I noticed the classroom filled with the mixed smell of dozens of lunchboxes.\n[1975-09-15 11:00:00] school hallway | I was on duty that week, walking alone into the empty corridor. I saw millions of dust particles shimmering in the light. Faint murmurs from classrooms on both sides reached my ears. Coats hung along both sides of the hallway, and the vinyl floor gave off a dull sheen. I knew that being on duty meant handing out materials, cleaning the blackboard, and collecting milk. At that moment, I sensed a unique atmosphere in the empty hallway, as if those dust particles formed a miniature galaxy.\n[1975-09-15 11:05:00] school hallway | I felt the boy who burst out was like a comet, instantly transforming the hallway’s atmosphere, sweeping away all the smells and light. I realized he seemed to take all attention with him, becoming the center of this place.\n[1975-09-15 12:00:00] school classroom | I watched Teacher Tormodsen stand hunched over the podium, clearing his throat and coughing up phlegm. I heard him read us a story about a wild woman in a muffled, nasal voice. I saw the teacher’s pale yellow face and lips tinged red with a hint of blue. I knew this was his lunchtime reading session. I found sitting quietly, listening to a story I couldn’t understand, an excruciating torment. I thought to myself: maybe this was his way of showing kindness.\n[1975-09-15 12:00:00] front door | On a rainy day, I walked across the gravel in my rain boots and raincoat. I tightly gripped the key, trying to insert it into the lock, but couldn't turn it no matter what. I knew Mom had given me this key so I could enter the house by myself. As far as I was concerned, it was a proud symbol hanging around my neck, yet I was now running into trouble. I had originally felt very happy and proud that I could open the door by myself.\n[1975-09-15 12:10:00] front door | I stood in the pouring rain for ten minutes. After trying with all my strength, I began to cry. I watched as other children quickly slipped into their homes. I felt my hands turn bright red and icy cold. I felt incredibly wronged and helpless.\n[1975-09-15 12:15:00] front door | I saw an unfamiliar elderly neighbor woman walking down the slope. I hurried over to ask her for help, tears still streaming down my cheeks. I cried and asked her if she could help me unlock the door. I knew she didn’t have any connection with my parents, which made me less hesitant to ask her. At that moment, I just wanted to get inside as quickly as possible.\n[1975-09-15 12:20:00] front door | I saw the old woman gently adjust the key, then smoothly turn the lock open. I thanked her and went inside. I marveled inwardly: Goodness, unlocking the door was so effortless for her!\n[1975-09-15 13:00:00] school | I saw Teacher Mikkelbyst standing slowly beside the podium, eyeing us. He rose onto his toes and bowed to us. I heard him say seriously to us, 'Good morning, class.' We had to respond in unison, 'Good morning, teacher.' After the entire class marched into the classroom, we fell completely silent under the teacher’s gaze. I knew this teacher came from the west and enforced ironclad discipline. As far as I knew, his physical education classes were essentially drill exercises.\n[1975-09-15 13:10:00] school | I saw the teacher yank disobedient students up by their hair or throw them out of the classroom. I knew that for rule-breakers, the teacher would slap them or write notes to their parents. I remembered once being pulled up by my hair by a female teacher for saying something wrong. As far as I knew, detention after school was hard to enforce since many of us relied on buses to get home. I felt both respect and deep fear toward these teachers.\n[1975-09-15 14:00:00] school | I saw Teacher Ciliavik Oscar always maintaining calm and composure while in full control. I knew Ciliavik belonged to the younger generation of 'kind' teachers. As far as I knew, she never got angry or physically punished students, but instead resolved issues through dialogue. I realized her demeanor in class and outside class was almost identical. We all really liked teachers like her.\n[1975-09-15 14:10:00] school | I knew Principal Osmundsen was strong-built and wore a mustache. As far as I knew, going to the principal’s office usually meant you’d committed a serious offense. I knew he rarely appeared during regular classes, like a ghost. Even though he wasn’t like my father, I instinctively felt afraid of him. I realized most students’ fear of the principal had never diminished.\n[1975-09-15 14:20:00] school | I watched this bearded man display the ivory he had retrieved from a shipwreck. I knew the principal was a legendary diver who had discovered a slave ship from 1768. As far as I knew, newspapers and television had reported on his exploits. Among all professions, aside from sailors, I admired divers the most. Having a diver as our principal felt as thrilling as having an astronaut at school. I drew countless pictures of divers and sunken ships—these topics could excite me for weeks.",

I watched her walk in tiredly, a handbag slung over her shoulder. I noticed she wasn’t carrying the sports store bag, and my heart sank. I thought, did she really forget to buy the swimming cap?\n[1975-09-16 15:31:00] hallway at home | I asked anxiously, \"What about the swimming cap you were supposed to buy?\" I heard my mother sigh regretfully, blaming herself for forgetting while thinking about other things on her way home from work. I reminded her that the swimming lesson started at six. I felt deeply disappointed because I had specifically reminded her the night before.\n[1975-09-16 15:32:00] hallway at home | I watched as my mother glanced at her watch and said she could still make it if she went now, asking me to let Dad know. I nodded at her. I urged her, \"Then go quickly!\" I heard her say she'd be back in an hour.\n[1975-09-16 15:40:00] kitchen | I saw Dad standing in the kitchen with his back turned, frying beef patties, one hand holding a spatula, the other braced against the countertop. I smelled the greasy fumes from cooking in the kitchen. I heard the radio playing and the lid of the pot rattling from steam pressure.\n[1975-09-16 15:41:00] kitchen | Dad suddenly turned around and stared at me. I stood frozen on the grass. I called out timidly, \"Dad.\" I heard him ask, \"What do you want?\" I truthfully relayed Mom's message that she'd be back in an hour. He then asked whether she had come back and left again.\n[1975-09-16 15:42:00] kitchen / bedroom | I saw Dad nod toward the direction of my room, so I quickly walked in. I saw clear irritation in his eyes. With the situation uncertain, I didn't dare linger—relieved he let me off so easily.\n[1975-09-16 16:40:00] kitchen | I slipped out of my room and sat down at the table. I saw Dad dividing beef patties, potatoes, and carrots onto our plates. We began eating in silence. I sat up straight, not daring to move carelessly, carefully observing all table manners.\n[1975-09-16 17:00:00] kitchen / bedroom | After dinner, we said thank you and returned to our rooms. I heard the sound of Dad making coffee in the kitchen. Then I heard him walking downstairs to his office with his cup.\n[1975-09-16 17:30:00] bedroom / stairway hallway | I lay in bed listening to sounds outside. I heard the familiar roar of an engine and immediately stood at the landing, waiting. I was absolutely certain that was Mom’s Beetle—I could never mistake that sound. I thought this was the best spot to wait for her, since Dad was in his office downstairs.\n[1975-09-16 17:35:00] stairway hallway | I heard the door open, followed by the sounds of boots being removed and a coat hung up. I watched as Mom climbed the stairs. I asked impatiently, \"Did you get it? Let me see?\" I heard her say everything had gone smoothly.\n[1975-09-16 17:36:00] stairway hallway | I saw Mom hand me a white Intersport bag. I opened it and pulled out the swimming cap inside. I protested, \"Mom, there are flowers on it! I don’t want one with flowers! This won’t do! It’s a girl’s swimming cap! You bought me a girl’s swimming cap!\"\n[1975-09-16 17:36:30] stairwell | I stood there, staring down at the floor. I heard Mom ask, \"Well, isn't that nice?\" I saw it was a white cap with raised plastic embroidery, not printed patterns.\n[1975-09-16 17:37:00] stairwell | I insisted to Mom, \"You have to exchange it right away. I can't wear this to swimming class. I won't go. I'll stay home.\" I heard her ask helplessly, \"Do you really think it's that bad?\"\n[1975-09-16 17:38:00] stairwell | I felt tears rolling down my cheeks. I heard Mom say, \"You used to love going to swimming lessons. Does it really matter if there are some flowers on the hat? We'll buy a new one next time.\" I heard Mom say she needed a swim cap and thought the flowers looked nice.\n[1975-09-16 17:38:30] stairwell | I almost shouted, \"You don't understand anything—it's not okay! This is a girl's swim cap!\" I heard Mom sigh, saying she thought I was being unreasonable.\n[1975-09-16 17:39:00] stairwell | I saw the door to Dad's office open, and he stepped onto the landing halfway up the stairs. I quickly wiped my eyes and put the cap back into the bag. I heard Dad ask, \"What's going on?\" I realized Dad always knew exactly when something was wrong, especially at moments like this.\n[1975-09-16 17:40:00] stairwell | I saw Dad walk up the stairs and lift my chin with his hand. I heard Mom explain that I didn't like the swim cap she'd bought, so I was throwing a tantrum and refusing to go swimming. I heard Dad snap, \"Nonsense!\"\n[1975-09-16 17:41:00] stairwell | I wiped under my eyes with my hand. I heard Dad order, \"Take the swim cap your mother bought and go to swimming class. Understand? Don't cry over something so trivial. You look pathetic. Go back to your room.\" I mumbled, \"Understood,\" \"Yes.\"\n[1975-09-16 17:45:00] bedroom / kitchen | I did as he said, walked into my room and waited for departure. I heard Dad say to Mom, \"You went all the way back into town just to buy this.\" Mom explained it was because I had been so excited about swimming, and she'd forgotten earlier.\n[1975-09-16 18:30:00] hallway at home | I followed Mom downstairs, put on my boots and raincoat. In my hand I carried the plastic bag containing my swimsuit and that hat. I decided not to speak to her anymore—not a single word.\n[1975-09-16 18:31:00] doorway | I opened the door and saw Karl Larsdal and Toya Moen standing outside, holding plastic bags. We hurried together along the gravel path. Before me lay the gloomy night, the air filled with fine misty rain. I saw their raincoats glistening under the porch light. I felt the outside world was eerie, somewhat frightening.\n[1975-09-16 18:32:00] beside the car | I saw Mom and her companions greeting each other. Mom opened the car door, and we children climbed into the back seats. null null null null\n[1975-09-16 18:33:00] inside the car | I saw Mom start the engine, and the car reversed uphill to turn around. I heard Toya Moen ask, 'Something wrong with the exhaust muffler?' Mom replied, 'Yes, it's an old car.' null null null\n[1975-09-16 18:35:00] inside the car | I sat in the seat directly behind Dad. I said, 'Karl Larsdal can swim.' I heard Mom respond, 'How nice!' I saw the windshield wipers slowly moving across the front window. The headlights illuminated the dark pine trees along the roadside. null I suddenly realized I shouldn't have spoken to Mom. I noticed that unless I leaned sideways, Dad couldn't see me in the mirror.\n[1975-09-16 18:36:00] inside the car | I saw Mom glance briefly to the right, then turn onto the main road, repeating the same motion at the next intersection. She raised the turn signal lever to indicate a left turn. I heard Mom ask, 'So, Toya Moen, have you learned swimming completely?' null null null\n[1975-09-16 18:40:00] inside the car / on the bridge | I saw the red lights atop the bridge posts flashing in the night. The car was driving upward toward the bridge. I heard Toya Moen shake his head and say, 'Only a little.' A loud engine roar filled my ears, bouncing back from the cliff walls. null I thought those red lights looked like burning flames—someone unfamiliar would surely believe they were floating in midair.\n[1975-09-16 18:41:00] inside the car | null null The car drove onto the bridge. I saw how the darkness of the heavy rain merged the coves and hills into one. Distant lights resembled stars scattered across the sky. null I noticed a unique reflection on the water’s surface, distinguishing it from the deep darkness of the land.\n[1975-09-16 18:42:00] inside the car / on the bridge | null null I saw the car enter a fork—one side leading to a residential area, the other to factories. Under the headlights, the yellow factory buildings looked empty through the curtain of rain. null null\n[1975-09-16 18:43:00] inside the car / on the road | null I heard Toya Moen say that Helen Sterne mentioned the teacher was very strict. The rain grew heavier; the windshield wipers worked busily. null I remembered Helen Stimson was a liar, and felt he was deliberately trying to scare Toya Moen.\n[1975-09-16 18:45:00] inside the car | I saw Karl Larsdal showing me his blue-lensed Speedo goggles. I said although I didn’t have goggles, I could still see underwater. I heard Toya Moen ask, 'What about a swim cap?' Karl laughed and said he wore his dad’s, which was a bit too big. null null null\n[1975-09-16 18:46:00] inside the car | I saw Mom lift her arm to check her watch. I heard Toya Moen ask if my dad had a swim cap. I answered, 'I don’t think so.' I also asked Mom if we were running late, and heard her reply, 'Five thirty-five—it's plenty of time.' null null null\n[1975-09-16 18:47:00] in the car | I saw Karl Larsdal talking. I heard Karl say, \"Next time I want a white swimming cap with the national flag on it—Dad promised me today.\" He also said he wanted to join the city's swimming club once he learned how. I curiously asked, \"Then we won't be able to play football together anymore?\"\n[1975-09-16 18:48:00] in the car | I saw Mom drive the car onto a gravel road and stop in front of a dark building. I heard Mom point ahead and say, \"I think it's just up there.\" Toya Moen also said that Thomas and Karlsen had already arrived.\n[1975-09-16 18:49:00] in the car | I grabbed my bag and climbed out of the car, running toward the entrance. I heard Mom say she’d pick us up in an hour and wished us good luck. I heard the Beetle turn around and drive away.",

    "text": "[1975-09-16 18:50:00] outside the swimming hall | I saw five boys sitting in the changing room, taking off their clothes. They laughed and greeted us. I saw Karin Ingrid and her friends walking toward the showers. I heard Karin Ingrid say, \"The water in the pool is so cold!\" Toya Moen curiously asked if they had tried it already. Green floors, white walls, and harsh lighting from the ceiling met my eyes.\n[1975-09-16 18:51:00] outside the swimming hall | I sat down on a bench and took off my sweater and pants. I caught a faint, pleasant smell of chlorine. I thought I really loved swimming pools.\n[1975-09-16 19:00:00] changing room | I watched the other boys standing naked under the showers. I took out soap and a towel from my bag and got ready to go in. I knew there was a strict rule requiring everyone to shower before entering the pool.\n[1975-09-16 19:05:00] changing room | I saw the boys carefully turning their shoulders toward the showerheads. I saw them standing with their backs against the wall, hair wet and clinging to their foreheads. I saw them cautiously feeling the water flow as if facing a wild beast.\n[1975-09-16 19:06:00] changing room / shower room | I took off my underwear and folded my clothes neatly on the bench. I saw Helen Ster come in with a few others. I didn’t like standing naked while others were still dressed, so I quickly stepped into the shower. I was glad Karl and the others followed in right after me.\n[1975-09-16 19:07:00] shower room | I turned off the faucet, dried myself, and walked back to the changing room to put on my swimsuit. I felt the warm mist from the showerheads fill the room. I noticed my buttocks had turned red like a monkey’s after the hot spray. I thought this cozy feeling could go on forever. But I realized the redness might easily invite mockery, so I had to get dressed quickly.\n[1975-09-16 19:10:00] changing room / shower room | I sat on the bench for a while, watching as everyone gradually came out of the shower. I remembered Dad once joked that I had a 'sticking-out bottom.' I worried others might notice and talk about it—it mattered deeply to me.\n[1975-09-16 19:15:00] shower room | I saw the group of boys, their damp hair making their skin look especially pale. I sat on the bench, rubbing hard at the goosebumps on my arms. The air was icy cold. I noticed the marks left by swimsuits standing out clearly on their pale skin. I tried to find the pleasure brought by chlorine, but it seemed to have vanished.\n[1975-09-16 19:20:00] shower room / changing room | I saw the lights come on in the pool. The boys in the changing room hurriedly pulled on swim trunks and put on goggles. I heard someone shout: 'It's starting!' Through the crack in the door, I saw the swimming hall brightly lit up.\n[1975-09-16 19:21:00] changing room | I crumpled my swimming cap into a ball and gripped it in my hand. I followed Karl Larsdal into the swimming hall and saw the girls emerging from the other side as well. I heard the teacher, a whistle hanging around her neck, wave to us.\n[1975-09-16 19:25:00] changing room | I saw the teacher blow her whistle again. I watched the last few boys run out laughing. I heard the teacher shout: 'No running! Running is absolutely not allowed here. It's slippery, and the floor is hard.'\n[1975-09-16 19:26:00] changing room | I saw the teacher holding a list inside a plastic folder. I heard her say: 'Welcome to swimming class! Since it's your first time today, we'll start with free play, then move over to the mats for basic drills.'\n[1975-09-16 19:28:00] changing room / swimming hall | I heard Karin Ingrid ask: 'On these? Are we supposed to learn swimming on land?' I heard the teacher confirm yes, and then double-check whether everyone had taken a shower.\n[1975-09-16 19:30:00] swimming hall | I heard the teacher restate the rules: caps must be worn, no diving, and no pushing others underwater. We could only enter the pool using the ladder over there. I heard her say: 'Every time I blow the whistle, you come straight to me. Understood?' Everyone answered in unison: 'Understood.'\n[1975-09-16 19:31:00] poolside | I heard Helen Ster ask: 'So, can we dive then?' The teacher asked if he knew how, and after learning he only knew a little, she clearly said diving was not allowed.\n[1975-09-16 19:32:00] poolside | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes standing at the back of the line in a red swimsuit. When my name was called, I lowered my head. I heard the teacher begin roll call. I heard Ingeborg answer with a laugh: 'Here.' I felt a chill run through my entire body. I used to enjoy loud roll calls in class, but now I was dreading the moment that was coming.\n[1975-09-16 19:33:00] poolside | I saw Helen Ster waving his raised hand. Then the teacher’s gaze turned toward me. I heard the teacher call my name, and I whispered back: 'Here.'\n[1975-09-16 19:34:00] poolside | I lifted the swimming cap clenched in my hand slightly, so the teacher could see it. I heard the teacher ask where my cap was, and I replied that I wanted to wait until I got in the water before putting it on. She said firmly, 'There's no such thing as “feeling like it” here. Put it on!'\n[1975-09-16 19:35:00] poolside | I had to spread the cap open and fasten it properly on my head. I heard sharp laughter breaking out around me. I heard someone shout, 'Look at Grete Lundnes! He’s wearing a girl’s cap! There are flowers on it!' I felt the swimming cap burning on my head, and I wished I could vanish into the ground.\n[1975-09-16 19:36:00] poolside | I saw the teacher lower her eyes and continue calling names, reaching Marianne. I heard the teacher try to calm things down: 'Alright, alright! All the swimming caps here are just as good.' I knew they wouldn’t let me off easily. I felt the shoving glances and rude stares all around me.\n[1975-09-16 19:38:00] poolside | I walked over to the ladder, crouched down, dove forward into the water, and swam all the way to the bottom of the pool. I pushed myself along underwater until I surfaced, stood up, and looked for Karl. I felt the cold water enveloping my entire body. I enjoyed that feeling of being underwater, just centimeters above the pool floor. I thought maybe I could swim underwater—just that moving on the surface was the problem.\n[1975-09-16 19:39:00] poolside | I went over to Karl and Toya, who were kicking with their float boards. I heard Karin Ingrid mock me: 'Did you borrow your mom’s swimming cap, or what?' I shot back that it wasn’t true.\n[1975-09-16 19:40:00] poolside | We moved slowly through water up to our chests. I suggested we go diving together. I heard Toya Moen ask, 'Is it really true you can open your eyes underwater?' I told him it was true—as long as you kept them open. When he worried it might hurt, I assured him I didn’t feel any pain. I was glad he gave me the chance to show him.\n[1975-09-16 19:41:00] poolside | We practiced moving our legs like divers in the water. I noticed Karl Larsdal did better than all of us. I realized Karl had a real talent for these underwater games.\n[1975-09-16 19:45:00] inside the pool | I heard the whistle and walked toward the blue mat. I saw Marianne walking toward me. I heard Marianne taunt me: 'Why are you wearing a girl’s swimming cap? Do you think the flowers are pretty or something?' I heard the teacher immediately step behind us and stop her. I had almost managed to forget about the cap, but her provocation made me feel awful again.\n[1975-09-16 19:50:00] inside the pool | I saw the teacher correcting our movements by the edge. We lay on mats and kicked like frogs, then returned to the water to practice with our boards. I heard the teacher briefly praise everyone and announce what we’d be doing in the next lesson.\n[1975-09-16 19:55:00] inside the pool | I saw them nod, and we moved slowly and heavily through the water until it reached under our arms. I heard myself suggest, 'Shall we walk a bit farther and go diving?' Toya Moen asked me, 'Is it really true you can open your eyes underwater?' I told him, 'Yes, really—just keep your eyes open, that’s all.' He said anxiously, 'But won’t it hurt?' I answered, 'My eyes don’t hurt.' I was glad he gave me this chance to show him.",

I saw that Karl Larsdal came quite close. I realized none of us could truly do it, but he really was good at underwater games.\n[1975-09-16 20:10:00] by the swimming pool | I saw Marianne walking toward me. I heard Marianne sneer, 'Why are you wearing a girl's swimming cap? You think the flowers are pretty, don't you?' A sharp whistle blew from the swimming pool, urging us to gather for training on the blue mats. At that moment, I had almost completely forgotten about the swimming cap.\n[1975-09-16 20:10:10] by the swimming pool | I heard the swimming instructor say from behind, 'That's enough about the swimming cap. Understood?' Then I heard Marianne reply, 'Yes.'\n[1975-09-16 20:20:00] by the swimming pool / changing room | We lay on the mats, kicking our legs outward and swinging our arms. I saw the teacher circling around, correcting our movements. Then we returned to the pool to practice with float boards. After finishing, we gathered by the poolside. Finally, I followed everyone into the changing room. I noticed that when we lay on the mats, we looked like a group of pale, oversized frogs. The teacher briefly praised us and explained what we'd be doing in the next lesson, along with instructions about showering.\n[1975-09-16 20:30:00] changing room | I had just sat down on the bench to put away my swim cap when I saw Karl Inge suddenly leap forward and snatch it from my hand. I heard him say, 'Let me see!' I shouted urgently, 'No, give it back!'\n[1975-09-16 20:31:00] changing room | I stood up and reached out to him. I saw him hop backward, evading me. He put the cap on his head and began walking, deliberately swaying his hips. I heard him mock in a girlish voice, 'Ah, how beautiful the flowers are on my swimming cap.' I yelled at him, 'Give it to me.'\n[1975-09-16 20:32:00] changing room | I saw him twist forward a few more steps. When I rushed toward him, he dangled the cap in front of me, retreating teasingly. I heard him sing repeatedly, 'The girl's swimming cap Grete Lundnes wears...' I shouted, 'Give it to me! It's mine!'\n[1975-09-16 20:33:00] changing room | I advanced another step. I saw Karl Inge throw the cap to Helen Ster. I turned toward Helen, trying to grab the cap back. I noticed he tightly gripped my arm while waving the cap just beyond my reach. I heard him continue singing that mocking line.\n[1975-09-16 20:34:00] changing room | I started crying. I felt tears blurring my vision. I saw Helen Ster toss the cap back to Karl Inge. I cried out, 'I want my cap! Give it back to me!'\n[1975-09-16 20:35:00] changing room | I saw him hold the cap up in the air, examining it. Finally, he threw it back in my direction. I heard him taunt, 'Look how beautiful these flowers are! Ah, they're so stunning!' Someone else said nearby, 'Give him the cap—he's crying.' Then he said to me, 'Ah, poor little thing, do you want your pretty cap back?'\n[1975-09-16 20:45:00] outside the swimming pool | I went over to pick up my hat and towel, then ducked into the shower room for a quick hot shower. I got dressed quickly, was the first to leave the changing room, and put on my boots in the corridor. I pushed open the glass door and stepped out onto the asphalt-covered open ground outside. I saw that in the darkness, the large shallow puddles on the asphalt glistened brightly. There was no one around.\n[1975-09-16 20:50:00] inside the car | I walked toward the building that looked exactly like our school. I saw Mom’s green Volkswagen Beetle parked in the same spot, so I opened the door and climbed into the back seat. The surroundings looked just as they had when I got off the car over an hour earlier.\n[1975-09-16 20:51:00] inside the car | I heard Mom greet me: 'Hi.' I replied, 'Hi.' Mom asked, 'Everything go well?' I answered, 'Yes.' She asked about Karl and Toya, and I told her, 'They’ll be here soon.' I saw Mom turn around, and the vulture-like light cast a faint glow on her cheek.\n[1975-09-16 20:52:00] inside the car | I heard Mom ask curiously, 'So, can you swim now?' I told her, 'Almost. But most of the time we practiced swimming motions on the floor, on mats.' I heard her say thoughtfully, 'Ah, that's how they do it.' Then I saw her turn away again.\n[1975-09-16 20:55:00] inside the car | I saw Mom take a deep drag from her cigarette, then pull out the metal ashtray and stub it out. I noticed several cars driving into the swimming pool area one after another. Thick gray smoke gathered beneath the windshield. I saw headlights sweeping back and forth across the asphalt road.\n[1975-09-16 20:56:00] inside the car | I opened the car door and shouted outside. I said to Mom, 'Maybe I should let them know you're here.' Then I called out, 'Karl Larsdal, Toya Moen! The car is here!'\n[1975-09-16 20:57:00] inside the car | I saw them glance in my direction, but they still didn’t move from the crowd, so I kept shouting at them. I shouted again, 'Karl Larsdal, Toya Moen! Come over here now!'\n[1975-09-16 21:00:00] inside the car | I saw them jogging across the playground toward me, then climbing into the back seat. I heard them say to Mom, 'Hi, Mrs. Grete Lundnes.' I noticed the only reflective points on them were the white plastic bags swinging in their hands, making them look like two floating heads.\n[1975-09-16 21:01:00] inside the car | I heard Mom ask them, 'Hi, did you have fun?' They answered, 'Y-yes.' I added, 'Yeah, it was great, but the swimming teacher was too strict.' Mom followed up, 'Was he strict?' I corrected her, 'She. She was strict.'\n[1975-09-20 09:00:00] school/home | I learned that the year I started school, people began mocking those who believed in legends like water spirits. I knew that the existence of the dead was something everyone understood silently. I realized that even though the legends were no longer believable, the idea of ghosts still haunted me—perhaps because we simply can't stop thinking about them.\n[1975-09-20 09:00:10] home | On a deep autumn morning during my first grade year, we decided to set out and go treasure hunting. I marveled in my heart how bright and pure the idea was—that treasure lay buried at the end of a rainbow. Up until then, I still believed it without a doubt.\n[1975-09-20 09:01:00] muddy ravine | I remember it was a Saturday in September, and it had rained all morning. I was down in the muddy ravine below Karlsen’s house, where pools of water were everywhere. I saw tiny streams dripping steadily from between moss and soil along the cliff face.\n[1975-09-20 09:05:00] muddy ravine | I was wearing rubber boots and thick rain pants, with my rain hat pulled tightly over my head. I felt how everything around me had changed: my own breathing and the sound of my ears brushing against the hat became unusually clear, while the noise of the outside world seemed distant.\n[1975-09-20 09:10:00] muddy ravine | Before me lay the mountain peak shrouded in thick fog. I noticed the orange-yellow roofs below glowing faintly in the morning light. Looking up, the sky hung low and heavy with dark clouds, and raindrops tapped softly on my rain hat.\n[1975-09-20 09:30:00] in front of Jacobsen's house | I was building a dam, but the sand kept sliding down. I caught sight of Jacobsen’s car approaching, so I quickly dropped my shovel and ran toward their house. I saw a small puff of blue smoke come from the car’s exhaust pipe as it came to a smooth stop in front of the house.\n[1975-09-20 09:31:00] in front of Jacobsen's house | I saw his father—thin as a nail—step out of the car, cigarette dangling from his lips as he pushed the seat forward. Carl and Thomas climbed out from the backseat. I also noticed their pale, red-haired mother settling the youngest daughter inside.\n[1975-09-20 09:31:10] in front of Jacobsen's house | I heard everyone exchange greetings: 'Hey.' I asked them, 'Where did you go?' Carl and Thomas told me they’d just returned from town. I also heard his father greet me.\n[1975-09-20 09:31:30] in front of Jacobsen's house | I heard his father ask, 'Do you want to hear how seven hundred seventy-seven is said in German?' I shouted, 'Yes!' Then, in a hoarse voice, he pronounced: 'Siebenhundert-und-siebundsiebsich!' Immediately after, I heard him burst into loud laughter.\n[1975-09-20 09:31:40] in front of Jacobsen's house | I laughed along too. I noticed his laughter quickly turned into a coughing fit.\n[1975-09-20 09:31:50] in front of Jacobsen's house | I saw his father twist the car lock shut and noticed his lips and eyelids twitching involuntarily. Thomas asked me, 'Where are you going?' I answered, 'Don’t know.' When I heard he wanted to join, I readily agreed.",

    "text": "[1975-09-20 09:32:00] in front of the Jacobsen house | I saw that Thomas was smaller and thinner than the rest of us, with a thick, red lower lip, like a pale-haired puppet. His brother had a pair of shrewd eyes, and his smile always carried a mocking edge. I knew Thomas was our age. I learned that his brother’s straight hair was light brown.\n[1975-09-20 09:32:10] in front of the Jacobsen house | I heard his mother tell him, \"Put on your raincoat.\"\n[1975-09-20 09:33:00] in front of the Jacobsen house | I saw Thomas run back inside to get his raincoat, while Karl and I waited quietly outside. The rain had just stopped. I felt a breeze swaying the pine trees. I noticed the little stream by the roadside carrying away pine needles, yellow fishbone-shaped needles scattered everywhere. Looking down at myself with arms hanging loosely, I thought Karl and I looked just like two penguins.\n[1975-09-20 09:35:00] in front of the Jacobsen house | I saw the clouds parting behind me, and the entire housing area bathed in soft light. Above the small hill we called \"the peak,\" a beautiful rainbow stretched across the sky.\n[1975-09-20 09:35:10] in front of the Jacobsen house | I pointed at the sky and shouted, \"Look, a rainbow!\" I heard Karl let out an exclamation of wonder.\n[1975-09-20 09:36:00] in front of the Jacobsen house | I saw Thomas running over. I heard Karl shout excitedly, \"The rainbow over that hill!\" Thomas replied, \"Yeah, then let's go!\"\n[1975-09-20 09:37:00] Karlsen's lawn | My friends and I sprinted down the hill at full speed. As we passed Karlsen's house, I saw Viktor's sister, Toya, tethered in place with a safety strap, staring at us. I noticed a red car parked in the driveway, its headlights casting a faint glow on the wall.\n[1975-09-20 09:38:00] outside Oskar Magnus's house | I followed Thomas into Oskar Magnus's driveway. I saw those concrete gateposts exactly as my father had described—very peculiar in design. When Thomas said Toya Moen would surely want to come, I thought he probably wasn’t home. I decided to go in and ask anyway.\n[1975-09-20 09:38:10] outside Oskar Magnus's house | I saw the strange metal sculpture on the gatepost—a naked man holding aloft a hollow earth pierced by an arrow. As far as I knew, it was a sundial, but my father always joked that putting up two of them made no sense at all.\n[1975-09-20 09:38:20] outside Oskar Magnus's house | I heard all three of us shouting at the top of our lungs: \"Toya Moen! Come out!\"\n[1975-09-20 09:39:00] Outside Oskar Magnus's house | I saw the kitchen window slide open, and his mother leaned out. I heard her say, 'He'll be right there. Coming just in a raincoat. Stop shouting now.'\n[1975-09-20 09:39:10] Outside Oskar Magnus's house | I pictured the three-legged black iron pot in my mind, surely filled with gold and jewels. I thought that since the rainbow was fading fast, we had to act without delay. Remembering past failed treasure hunts, I felt determined to move quickly this time.\n[1975-09-20 09:40:00] Outside Oskar Magnus's house | I saw a shadow pass behind the glass of the door, then it opened. I felt a wave of heat hit my face—he always kept his house so warm. I caught the distinct sour-sweet smell unique to their home. I realized every family has its own particular scent.\n[1975-09-20 09:40:10] Outside Oskar Magnus's house | I saw Toya Moen slam the door shut and take off running ahead of us. I heard Toya ask, 'So what are we doing now?' Thomas told her we were going to find the treasure beneath the rainbow. At that, Toya shouted, 'Then let’s go!'\n[1975-09-20 09:41:00] The path leading up to the hilltop | I followed closely behind them down the slope, stepping onto the path that led up the mountain.\n[1975-09-20 09:42:00] Home/outdoors | The cool indoor air met my eyes. I noticed my brother’s car was gone, but my parents’ car was parked outside. I remembered that when I left, Mom was bent over, busy cleaning. On that gray Saturday morning, the air was filled with chill. I inwardly complained that the vacuum cleaner’s noise felt like a wall pressing against me. The house was so cold I couldn’t even stay long enough to read, so I fled outside, hoping something interesting might happen.\n[1975-09-20 09:42:10] At home | As far as I knew, other kids’ parents didn’t usually clean like this. I knew the Prestbakmo household was unusual in that way. I wondered to myself whether such a habit of both parents cleaning together was really normal. I even doubted whether Prestbakmo could do any housework at all.\n[1975-09-20 09:42:20] Town/office | I knew Dad had gone to the fish market today and bought crabs. From what I understood, he’d usually retreat to his office afterward—smoking, grading papers, or reading comics.\n[1975-09-20 09:43:00] Yanhaug Supermarket path | As we walked uphill, my gaze lingered on a large puddle among the small trees. Beyond the black yard fence, I saw groundwater seeping out from a drain, spreading across the muddy ground. White toilet paper floated on the water’s surface. I knew my father served on the council, and Helen Stervik once said this seepage was my father’s 'responsibility'. I realized the word 'responsibility' must have come from my father Oscar. I decided I’d find a chance to remind my dad to bring this up during a meeting.\n[1975-09-20 09:44:00] Corner of the house | I saw my father crossing the lawn, his upper body slightly twisted, holding a ladder in his hands. I watched him lift it upright and lean it diagonally against the eaves of the roof. I noticed he was wearing a blue raincoat, no hat, and his green rubber gardening boots on his feet.\n[1975-09-20 09:45:00] the path leading to the mountaintop | I turned around and quickened my pace, trying to catch up with my friends ahead.\n[1975-09-20 09:45:10] the path leading to the mountaintop | I heard myself shout loudly, 'The rainbow is still there!' Then I heard Leif call back, 'We see it too!'\n[1975-09-20 09:46:00] beside Mordal's garden | I caught up with them at the start of the trail. I followed Lenavik’s yellow backpack into the woods. We passed by Mordal’s brown house. Every time we pushed aside branches, countless raindrops fell. I noticed only one teenager named Mordal lived there, wearing loose brown trousers. I knew there were no young children in the Mordal family; that teenager always wore big glasses.\n[1975-09-20 09:50:00] the edge of the mountaintop | We walked up the path beside their garden. I grabbed a small tree and pulled myself upward. When I reached the rocky area near the top, I stepped into a small exposed crack and climbed onto the summit. I noticed the terrain was extremely steep, covered with tall, slippery yellow grass. The cliff at the mountain's peak jutted outward, making it hard to climb on the wet ground.\n[1975-09-20 09:51:00] the mountaintop | I saw Thomas Linddal reach the summit first. I watched Karl Larsdal point toward a higher spot a few meters away. Toya Moen pointed down into the woods below. I heard Thomas ask, 'Where's the treasure?' Karl shouted, 'Over there!' Then Toya corrected him, 'No, down there! Look!'\n[1975-09-20 09:52:00] the mountaintop | I turned around with the others and looked down. I saw the rainbow arching across the forest below. One end landed in the woods beneath Bekk’s house, the other stretching to the grassy slope beside the bay.\n[1975-09-20 09:52:10] the mountaintop | I heard Thomas suggest, 'Well, shall we go down there?' Toya Moen said, 'But maybe the treasure is still here—anyway, we could keep looking for a while longer.'\n[1975-09-20 09:52:20] the mountaintop | I heard all of us repeat together in our local dialect, 'Anyway, let’s search once more!'\n[1975-09-20 09:52:30] the mountaintop | I watched them turn and walk deeper into the woods, scanning the area. I called out, 'It’s not here—the treasure is only where the rainbow is.' I heard Toya Moen suspect someone had already taken the treasure, but I argued, 'There’s no one here—have you lost your mind? It’s because of the rainbow.' Toya stubbornly argued with me. I saw Karl and Thomas join the search, but I insisted on not joining them.\n[1975-09-20 09:52:40] the mountaintop | I heard myself say firmly, 'I won’t look.'",

    "text": "[1975-09-20 09:55:00] mountaintop | I stood on the mountaintop and looked out. I saw the bridge rising as if from the treetops, the white gas tanks, and the harbor of Yerstavika Island. I also saw my own house and my neighbors' gardens. I overlooked the entire residential area, red and orange rooftops scattered among green trees. Boats always sailed through the narrow waterways. In the distance, the low concrete bridge and Ybe Bay were clearly visible. I thought there couldn't be a better viewing spot than this.\n[1975-09-20 09:56:00] mountaintop | I noticed the sky above the residential area had almost turned blue, while the clouds toward the city were snow-white. But on the other side, the clouds behind Ybe Bay remained dark and heavy.\n[1975-09-20 09:57:00] mountaintop | I saw my father below, now just a tiny black dot standing at the top rung of the ladder leaning against the roof. He looked no bigger than an ant to me.\n[1975-09-20 09:57:10] mountaintop | I felt a wind blowing in from deep out at sea. I wondered in my mind whether he could see me up here on the mountaintop now.\n[1975-09-20 10:00:00] mountaintop woods | I turned around looking for my friends. I saw two yellow patches and one blue patch moving among the trees. I noticed a log lying across the path that looked strangely shaped. The high ridge of the peak appeared blackish-gray with hints of yellow. A horizontal log was supported by slender branches, not touching the ground, seeming utterly still.\n[1975-09-20 10:05:00] mountaintop woods | On the slope below, I saw nothing growing except heather; tall pines and spruces surrounded the place like walls, forming a room-like enclosure. I knew that before, I'd never gone farther than the uprooted tree. I remembered Karl Larsdal once saying he'd seen a fox. I realized I wasn't really brave enough to go deeper into these woods. I thought you shouldn't take foxes lightly, so I'd brought food with me when I left home.\n[1975-09-20 10:06:00] mountaintop woods | I heard Toya Moen scream: \"Here! My God! Treasure!\" Then Karl shouted too: \"My God!\" I called back doubtfully: \"Don't fool me!\"\n[1975-09-20 10:06:10] mountaintop woods | I heard Tova shout: \"Haha! We're rich!\" Thomas Linddal also exclaimed: \"Good Lord!\"\n[1975-09-20 10:06:20] mountaintop woods | I suspected they were tricking me, but thinking about where the rainbow had touched down, I began wondering: what if the treasure pot hadn't vanished along with the rainbow?\n[1975-09-20 10:07:00] mountaintop woods | I took a few steps forward, trying to peer through the juniper and cloudberry bushes to see what they were doing.\n[1975-09-20 10:07:10] mountain-top woods | I heard Toya Moen shout at me, \"Hey! Look at this!\"\n[1975-09-20 10:08:00] mountain-top woods | I rushed through the bushes toward them. I saw them burst into laughter as they looked at me. I heard them mock me: \"You fell for it! Hahaha! You fell for it!\"\n[1975-09-20 10:08:10] mountain-top woods | I shouted defensively, \"I knew all along you were tricking me—I just came to call you.\" Toya Moen laughed back, \"No way. You totally fell for it.\" I urged them that if they didn't hurry up, the real rainbow would disappear.\n[1975-09-20 10:10:00] cliff edge | I called on Karl to prepare to head down the mountain. I heard Toya Moen suggest having a pissing contest at the cliff's edge. I said to Karl, \"Come on, let's go down there and find the treasure.\" I heard Toya say he needed to take a piss and wanted to see who could pee the farthest. I saw that Karl, though reluctant, still followed me. I thought he really was my best friend.\n[1975-09-20 10:10:10] cliff edge | I saw my friends pulling down their rain pants to get ready for the contest. I stared at their wriggling buttocks. I remembered my father was still below—if he looked up and saw us peeing right now, it would be terrible.\n[1975-09-20 10:10:20] cliff edge | I refused, \"I don't have to pee—I just went.\"\n[1975-09-20 10:10:30] cliff edge | I saw Karl Larsdal turn his head to stare at me, his penis still in hand. I heard Karl say suspiciously, \"You didn't pee—we've been together all day.\" I insisted I had gone while looking for treasure.\n[1975-09-20 10:11:00] cliff edge | I stepped forward a few paces to inspect the results of the contest. I watched Karl tuck his little 'elephant trunk' back into his pants. I heard Toya boast about his brother's pissing skills. Then I heard Karl say regretfully, \"The rainbow's gone.\" I saw the urine they'd sprayed rising in steaming vapor in the cold air. I noticed Thomas Linddal had actually peed the farthest.\n[1975-09-20 10:12:00] cliff edge | We all looked down the mountain together. I heard Thomas ask, \"What should we do now?\" Toya echoed him, equally lost.\n[1975-09-20 10:12:10] cliff edge | I suggested, \"Let's go to the boathouse down below? We can climb onto the roof.\" Toya Moen immediately chimed in excitedly.\n[1975-09-20 10:20:00] narrow bay/boat house | We angled down the cliff, cutting through thick spruce forest, and came out onto the gravel path by the bay. I saw gulls huddled across the barren hillside opposite. I saw the water in the bay was very shallow, the ground covered in clay. The houses around were all leaning and collapsed. I knew swimming wasn't possible here. I also remembered how we used to ski down this grassy slope in winter. I realized that in summer and autumn, we rarely came to this lifeless place.\n[1975-09-20 10:25:00] white old house | At the edge of the path and the woods, I saw a white old house where an elderly woman with white hair lived. I knew the woman lived alone, but I didn't know her name or anything about her life. I remembered that sometimes, just on impulse, I’d press my face against the windowpane and peer inside.\n[1975-09-20 10:26:00] white old house/boat house | I stared at the white house and the old granary. By the stream, I saw the unpainted old boat house. I saw the old furniture in the living room and the outdated kitchen items. The roof of the boat house was covered with asphalt felt.\n[1975-09-20 10:27:00] stream beside boat house | I saw broad male ferns growing thickly along both banks of the stream. I pushed aside the fronds and looked—underneath, there was almost nothing but soil. I saw the mud near the water had a rust-like red tint. Underground channels spurted fast-flowing water, bubbling up through the grass into the bay. I knew we could sometimes dig up odd things here—fragments, condoms, stuff like that. I felt as though these lush plants were deceiving our eyes—beneath them, everything was barren.\n[1975-09-20 10:30:00] boat house | I peered through cracks between the planks of the boat house. We studied how we might climb up onto the gray roof. I noticed the boat house had completely faded with age. Some gaps were wide enough to stick a hand through. I knew roughly what it looked like inside, even though we’d never been in.\n[1975-09-20 10:31:00] beside granary | We crept quietly up beside the granary and looked around. I carefully checked that no vehicle was parked behind the house. I’d heard the owner might be the white-haired woman’s son. I knew he sometimes forbade children from crossing his yard, so I felt some fear toward him. I thought if he wasn’t around, we could safely search here for a foothold.\n[1975-09-20 10:32:00] beside granary | I saw white cans and rusty metal drums scattered along the wall. Suddenly, to my delight, I spotted a bench. I saw a dismantled door leaning against the wall. I recognized that the cans contained formic acid. I’d seen these white cans at my grandmother’s farm. I thought: Ah! This is exactly the tool we’ve been looking for!\n[1975-09-20 10:35:00] boat house | We worked together to loosen the bench and lift it up. We carried it across the field and leaned it diagonally against the wall of the boat house. I saw a large swarm of woodlice and spider-like creatures scurrying out from under the bench, fleeing in panic. I felt the bench was as heavy as if it had grown rooted into the earth.\n[1975-09-20 10:40:00] boat house | I watched Toya Moen go first, stepping onto the bench to try. I saw him swing one leg over the roof, but then his hands slipped, and he dropped straight down like a sack. I knew Toya was the bravest among us. I saw he landed right on the slanted surface of the bench, then slid off onto the ground.\n[1975-09-20 10:40:10] boat house | I saw him slowly get back up, rubbing his thighs constantly. I heard him cry out in pain: “Ow! Damn it! That hurt like hell!” Then he turned to us and said: “Now someone else can try!”",

    "text": "[1975-09-20 10:40:20] boathouse | I saw him staring at me. I heard myself say, 'My arms aren't strong enough.'\n[1975-09-20 10:40:30] boathouse | I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'I can give it a try.' I knew Karl was impulsive and easily influenced. I remembered how his father helped us build the wooden cart that summer, and how I had praised his strength just to get him to push me around in circles. I realized that now, with just a little encouragement, he would do something reckless.\n[1975-09-20 10:45:00] boathouse | I watched Karl's movements. He grabbed the eaves with both hands, trying to walk along the wall. I saw his fingers slip from the edge and his whole body fall down. I thought his method was clumsy—even if he made it up, his body would still be parallel. I saw him hit the stool first, then bump the back of his head.\n[1975-09-20 10:45:10] boathouse | I saw him stand up, letting out a grunt like a sigh. I could tell he'd taken a hard fall, but he still wanted to try again.\n[1975-09-20 10:46:00] boathouse | I saw him step onto the stool again, this time changing his approach. He flung his legs up onto the roof, flipped his body over, and finally knelt on the roof, looking down at us. I heard the thud of his knees hitting the roof. I felt that his whole body had trembled slightly just now—he clearly exerted all his strength.\n[1975-09-20 10:46:10] boathouse | I heard him proudly say from above, 'It's not hard at all! Come on! I'll pull each of you up!'\n[1975-09-20 10:46:20] boathouse | I heard Thomas Linddal retort, 'You can't do it. You're not strong enough yet.' Karl insisted from above that he could at least try.\n[1975-09-20 10:47:00] boathouse | I heard Toya Moen call him down, 'I have to go home right now.' I shouted in agreement, 'Me too.'\n[1975-09-20 10:48:00] boathouse | I saw him crouching there, taking deep breaths as if preparing to dive into water. Then he leapt, rolled once upon landing, and sprang lightly back to his feet. I heard him declare, 'Well then, I'll jump down again. I just wanted to have some fun, feel alive.' I felt he hesitated for a moment up there, as if assessing the height. I saw him slap his thighs repeatedly after regaining his footing.\n[1975-09-20 10:48:10] boathouse | I saw Karl Larsdal crouching on the roof for a long time, staring at the ground and breathing deeply. Then I witnessed him leap down, roll once upon impact, and spring lightly back to his feet, forcefully slapping his thighs. I heard Toya Moen ask, 'Isn't that too high?' I heard Karl reply, 'No, I just wanted to have some fun, feel alive.' I watched his descent closely, sensing that instant of boldness in him.\n[1975-09-20 10:50:00] boat house | I know Toya Moen would never give up easily—he could practice balancing all night long. I understand Karl Larsdal is an impulsive person, someone who sometimes does impressive things without thinking of the consequences. I think, if I had climbed onto the roof by myself, I’d surely consider it a cause for celebration. I realize Karl’s reckless nature is what makes him stand out.\n[1975-09-20 11:00:00] the slope | We walked up the slope in silence. I tried stepping into a particularly wet patch of mud. I saw that parts of the path had been washed away by water, leaving long puddles. I felt gravel pushing up through the cracks under my shoes, and the sensation was oddly comforting.\n[1975-09-20 11:05:00] the slope | I looked down at my hands and tried using the other hand to scrape off the reddish-brown wart on my thumb. I felt how cold my hands were. When I clenched my fists, I saw white marks left behind on the red flesh of my fingers. I noticed several raised warts on both hands.\n[1975-09-20 11:10:00] beside the stone wall | We arrived at a new stretch of land bordered by a stone wall. I saw a tall spruce forest rising behind the wall, with steep terrain and protruding peaks. Before me stood a dense spruce forest about ten meters high, encircling the land. I noticed the scenery here resembled that of the small islands by the sea, and it made me happy.\n[1975-09-20 11:10:10] beside the stone wall | I imagined how incredible it would be to row or swim into this forest and travel through it—an amazing adventure indeed.\n[1975-09-20 20:00:00] Bidtangen | Last Saturday evening, I sat in the car and saw Dad carefully combing his hair in front of the rearview mirror. He patted and pressed down on his shiny hair before getting out to collect the mail. I know we have a mailbox in Bidtangen. As far as I know, Dad has to drive there specifically to pick up the mail because only newspapers are delivered to the mailbox up on the hill. I noticed that Dad cared so much about his appearance before picking up the mail—something rare and unusual for him.\n[1975-09-20 20:05:00] Bidtangen | I saw that when Dad went inside, a woman turned toward him. I knew she didn’t realize I was watching them from the car. I wonder who that woman really is. Could she be a parent of one of Dad’s students, or did they already know each other?\n[1975-09-22 12:00:00] front door / Karl Larsdal's house | I knew it hadn’t rained the second week, so I dropped my backpack by the door and ran off to find Karl—but got scolded by Dad. So by next Monday, I made up an excuse about doing homework and left the house with my schoolbag. I realized the key wasn’t the problem—it was my own guilt that made me afraid of facing the hassle of opening the door.\n[1975-09-27 14:00:00] the woods | I was walking up the hill through the woods with Karl and the others. I knew it had been seven days since our last treasure hunt. A strange fantasy suddenly came over me—I wanted to swim among these trees, but then I immediately realized I hadn’t even learned how to swim yet.\n[1975-09-27 14:05:00] the woods | I knew Grandpa, though a fisherman, couldn’t swim. I learned Grandma’s situation remained unclear. I tried picturing Grandma swimming in my mind, but found it nearly impossible to imagine.\n[1975-09-27 14:30:00] woods | I saw Thomas Linddal swing his arm to reveal his watch. I watched the clouds race swiftly past behind the pine trees. I asked Karl, \"Do you have a watch?\" He shook his head. I heard Thomas say, \"I do. Twenty-five past one—no, half past two.\" I exclaimed, \"Half past two?\" I looked up and saw the sky was clear, clouds moving quickly through the trees.\n[1975-09-27 14:31:00] woods | I immediately started running for my life, trying to make up time with speed. I knew that at one o'clock on Saturdays we always ate eight-treasure porridge at home. I felt a cramp in my stomach and silently groaned—oh no, I’d been gone far too long.\n[1975-09-27 14:32:00] woods | I ran while turning my head back to respond to my friends. I heard Toya Moen ask, \"Got bugs biting your butt or something?\" I shouted back, \"We eat at one—we’ve got to go.\"\n[1975-09-27 14:45:00] front of the house | I climbed over the dirt slope and crossed the creek. I saw both Mom’s and Dad’s cars parked in front, but Henrik Inge’s bicycle was nowhere to be seen. I saw the tall spruce trees swaying gently in the breeze. The driveway in front of the house seemed unusually quiet. I secretly hoped in my heart: I wish my brother were late too. Though I knew that was almost impossible.\n[1975-09-27 14:46:00] driveway | I crossed the road and stepped onto the driveway. I carefully scanned my surroundings. I wondered where Dad might be—was he hiding behind the house, or already waiting for me in the kitchen? The thought of him suddenly bursting out from his office made me tense.\n[1975-09-27 14:47:00] hallway / basement | I quietly closed the door and stood still for a moment. I quickly took off my boots and leaned them against the wall, then unzipped my raincoat and hung it up in the basement. I heard Dad’s footsteps moving above in the kitchen. The basement room felt warm, and the water heater hummed softly.\n[1975-09-27 14:50:00] kitchen | I walked up the stairs into the kitchen. I saw Mom washing dishes, and Dad sitting at the table eating crab claws. I noticed my reflection in the mirror—my cheeks were flushed, my hair messy, a bit of shiny snot under my nose. My prominent front teeth still stuck out as usual. I noticed they were both staring at me, and I began to feel uneasy.\n[1975-09-27 14:51:00] kitchen | I saw the porridge pot sitting on the electric stove, the orange spoon still sticking out of it. I apologized, \"I forgot, sorry. We were just having so much fun outside.\"\n[1975-09-27 14:52:00] kitchen | I sat down at the table and watched as Mom filled my plate with porridge, placing the sugar jar and cinnamon nearby. I heard Dad say, \"Sit down—I can imagine you must be starving.\" Mom said kindly, \"There you go. Now, where did you all go? Oh, and here—you’ll need a spoon too.\"\n[1975-09-27 14:55:00] kitchen | I leaned forward, staring into the wooden spoon Dad used to scoop porridge, checking for any meat bits. I saw Dad skillfully cracking open another crab claw. I answered, \"Just around, here and there.\" I heard Dad suck on the crab meat and press further, \"You and…?\" I saw brown dinner plates on the table and green glasses with lettering on the bottom. I heard the crisp snap of crab shells being broken apart.\n[1975-09-27 14:56:00] kitchen | I dropped a chunk of butter into my porridge and sprinkled it with sugar and cinnamon. I confessed honestly, \"With Karl Larsdal, Toya Moen, and Thomas Linddal.\" I thought this porridge might be cold, but with these toppings, it should still taste pretty good.\n[1975-09-27 14:57:00] kitchen | I heard Dad say between chews, \"So, where did you all go?\" He stared at me and asked, \"I think I saw you heading up the mountain path?\" I noticed a small fleck of pale white onion clinging to his beard. I felt his intense gaze locked onto me, making me tense and pressured.\n[1975-09-27 14:58:00] kitchen | I sat in my seat, feeling somewhat stiff. I insisted, \"We didn't go there.\" I heard Dad ask about schoolwork and teachers, and I replied that the teacher's name was \"Oskar Ciliavik.\" When I noticed the conversation shifting direction, I completely relaxed.\n[1975-09-27 14:58:10] kitchen | I remembered Norwich's yellow-and-green jerseys and Stoke's red-and-white stripes. But in my heart, I liked Wolverhampton best—because their wolf-head crest was so cool.\n[1975-09-27 14:58:20] kitchen | I really wanted to go back to my room, lie down, and read comics until the match started. But I realized under these circumstances, I absolutely dared not say 'no' to Dad.\n[1975-09-27 15:00:00] kitchen | I quickly finished the plate of cold porridge. I watched as Dad dumped the crab shells into a garbage bag. I heard Dad ask, \"Had enough to eat?\" I nodded.",

    "text": "[1975-09-27 15:05:00] stair landing | I followed closely behind Dad as we left the kitchen. Passing Henrik Inge's room, I stared at the tightly closed door. I heard Dad impatiently urging, \"Come on, move it.\" Faint music drifted from my brother's room. I saw the bicycle spot downstairs was empty. I felt deeply confused: if my brother's bike wasn't here, how could he be inside?\n[1975-09-27 15:10:00] gravel ground | I put on my coat and walked across the gravel. I followed Dad diagonally across the waterlogged lawn. I knew we were usually not allowed to step on the lawn. I figured since I was with Dad now, the household rule of 'keep off the grass' must be temporarily suspended. I saw Dad gripping the axe, seemingly in high spirits.\n[1975-09-27 15:15:00] kitchen garden | I stood by the fence, watching Dad prepare to split the birch logs. I just stayed quietly beside him. I knew these logs came from a birch tree he had felled long ago. I understood he simply wanted me to stand here and 'keep him company.'\n[1975-09-27 15:20:00] kitchen garden | I watched Dad place a log on the chopping block and raise the axe with full force. The blade bit deep into the white trunk. I heard Dad ask, \"What do you think—everything going well at school?\" The air was filled with the fresh scent of split wood. I noticed he was concentrating fully on his work.\n[1975-09-27 15:21:00] kitchen garden | I watched him repeatedly chop at the log on the chopping block until pieces scattered everywhere. He wiped his forehead with his hand. I replied briefly, \"Fine.\" I observed his posture and could tell he was now thoroughly content.\n[1975-09-27 15:22:00] kitchen garden | I saw him fetch another piece of wood and repeat the same motions as before. I heard him ask about teacher Torgersen. I answered, \"He's okay.\" Then he stopped and looked at me, saying, \"Okay? So someone must not be okay then?\"\n[1975-09-27 15:23:00] kitchen garden | I watched him continue swinging the axe, not answering right away. I heard him lecture me that if you think someone is 'okay,' there must be a comparison—otherwise the word has no meaning. He asked me, \"Understand?\" I replied, \"I suppose so.\"\n[1975-09-27 15:25:00] kitchen garden | I turned around and looked at the puddles on the grass across from me. I finally spoke up: \"Mikkelbyst, he's not doing well.\" I heard Dad repeat the name with some surprise.\n[1975-09-27 15:26:00] kitchen garden | I saw a smile appear on Dad's face. I heard him say, \"I know him. Next time I see him at parent-teacher meetings, I'll tell him he's not doing well by you kids at school.\" I quickly begged, \"No, don't, please!\" He laughed and reassured me he'd never actually do it.\n[1975-09-27 15:30:00] kitchen garden | I stood motionless with my arms crossed, continuing to watch him chop wood. I felt my feet and fingers growing cold because I wasn't wearing thick socks in my boots, and the chill was beginning to sting.\n[1975-09-27 15:35:00] kitchen garden | I saw the outdoors empty except for the occasional passing car. The lights inside the house shone especially bright against the deepening dusk. I felt darkness slowly seeping out from every crevice of the earth.\n[1975-09-27 15:40:00] kitchen garden | I stared at Dad. As he bent down to grab another log, he suddenly let out a loud fart. I couldn't help but call him out: \"You said people can only fart when they're on the toilet.\" I saw sweat running down his forehead. I saw him lower his head and avoid my gaze.\n[1975-09-27 15:40:10] kitchen garden | I heard him defend himself while working: \"Outdoors in fresh air it's different—then people can fart freely.\"\n[1975-09-27 15:41:00] kitchen garden | I heard the sound of the axe splitting into the wood. The chopping echoed off the walls and hills, creating a strange delayed reverberation, as if someone up in the mountains was mimicking Dad's movements.\n[1975-09-27 15:45:00] kitchen garden | I walked over to the small pile of firewood. I watched as he split four more pieces. I heard him tell me, \"Can't you stack those logs into a proper woodpile, Grete Lundnes?\" I felt completely puzzled: Why did he suddenly want me to stack the wood? I had no idea whether to build it against the wall or stack it upright.\n[1975-09-27 15:46:00] kitchen garden | I crouched down, picked up a log, and tried placing it against the hillside. I looked up at him, but he didn't acknowledge me. I was filled with hesitation, unsure if my way of stacking matched what he wanted.\n[1975-09-27 15:50:00] kitchen garden | I stood five logs side by side on the ground, then laid a few across the top. I saw they formed a crude square. I wondered whether I should keep expanding sideways or start building a new layer upward.\n[1975-09-27 15:51:00] kitchen garden | I saw Dad suddenly bend down and knock over my woodpile with one slap. I stood there staring at the wreckage, tears welling up. I heard him shout angrily, \"What on earth are you doing? Have you lost your mind? You can't stack a woodpile like that!\" I felt deeply wronged.\n[1975-09-27 15:52:00] kitchen garden | I watched him begin splitting wood again. I heard him say sharply, \"Take them over there and stack them properly! Have you never seen a woodpile before? Stop standing there crying—can't you do anything right?\" I struggled hard not to burst into tears like a little girl.\n[1975-09-27 15:55:00] kitchen garden | I started re-stacking the firewood as he demanded. I could feel the cold creeping up from the soles of my feet. I kept sniffing back sobs. As I worked, I kept wondering in my mind: When will this ever end?\n[1975-09-27 16:00:00] kitchen garden | After finishing stacking the wood, I straightened up and stood there watching him. I noticed the displeasure in his eyes. I realized his good mood had completely vanished. I didn't dare speak, afraid of provoking him again.\n[1975-09-27 16:05:00] kitchen garden | I watched him swing the axe repeatedly. I saw him habitually push his hair back. I was growing desperate inside—the football match must have started long ago. Though I wanted to remind him, I didn't dare utter a single word in this atmosphere.\n[1975-09-27 16:10:00] kitchen garden | I neatly stacked the logs Dad tossed over onto the woodpile. I kept wiggling my toes inside my boots. I could feel my toes growing cold and painful inside my boots, and no matter how hard I clenched them, the sharp pain wouldn’t go away.\n[1975-09-27 16:15:00] kitchen garden | I saw a puddle where it shouldn’t be, glinting in the light, and above the rusted sewer grate, a large, transparent bubble rose up through the flowing water. I wanted to say I was cold, but when I inhaled to speak, I swallowed the words back down.\n[1975-09-27 16:20:00] kitchen garden / path | I saw Gretevik walking up the path with a guitar case on his back, his head bobbing exaggeratedly as he walked, his long black hair swaying down to his shoulders. I watched him pass by me. I heard Gretevik greet me, saying: 'Hi, hi, Grete Lundnes.'\n[1975-09-27 16:21:00] kitchen garden | I saw Dad straighten up and nod at him. I heard Gretevik say: 'Out here chopping wood, huh!' Dad replied: 'Sure thing? See for yourself.'\n[1975-09-27 16:25:00] kitchen garden | I couldn't help taking a few small steps forward, then stepping back again, over and over. I heard Dad order: 'Stop hovering there.' I couldn't help replying: 'Yes, but I'm freezing!'\n[1975-09-27 16:26:00] kitchen garden | I looked at Dad, tears welling up in my eyes again. I heard him coldly mimic me: 'You're \"freezing,\" are you?' I shouted: 'Don't imitate me!' Dad shot back: 'Oh really? So I shouldn't \"imitate\" you?' I yelled at him: 'No!'\n[1975-09-27 16:27:00] kitchen garden | I saw Dad throw down his axe and come toward me. I felt him grab my ear and twist it hard. The pain made me lower my head and stare at the ground. I heard him demand: 'Are you still talking back?' I whispered: 'No.'\n[1975-09-27 16:28:00] kitchen garden | I was forced to lift my head, but I didn't dare meet his eyes. I felt him twist harder. I heard him shout: 'Look at me when I'm talking to you! No backtalk—got it!' I could only answer: 'Yes.'\n[1975-09-27 16:30:00] kitchen garden | I saw him let go and turn back, picking up another piece of wood and placing it on the chopping block. I stood to the side sobbing, my breathing becoming labored from crying so hard. I noticed Dad kept chopping wood, seemingly completely indifferent to my crying. I knew that once he finished the last few logs, he'd be done.\n[1975-09-27 16:35:00] kitchen garden | I went back to the woodpile and stacked the freshly chopped logs. I wiped my tears with my sleeve and wiggled my stiff toes inside my boots. I felt wave after wave of uncontrollable sobbing. Suddenly, a thought came to me, like a kind of salvation: I decided not to go with him to watch the football match—later, I would just go straight to my room and let him watch it alone with my brother.\n[1975-09-27 16:35:10] kitchen garden | I firmly told myself in my heart: That's how it will be. That's how it will be.\n[1975-09-27 16:40:00] kitchen garden | I saw Dad toss over the last four pieces of firewood. I heard him announce: 'Alright, we're done.'",

As I passed the living room, I saw my brother was already inside watching the match, so I went straight to my own room. I heard the sound of a football match broadcast from the living room TV.\n[1975-09-27 16:46:00] Bedroom | I sat down at my desk, casually opened a book, and pretended to read attentively.\n[1975-09-27 16:50:00] Bedroom | A few minutes later, I heard the door open. I waited inwardly for him to notice I wasn't there. I realized he had indeed come looking for me.\n[1975-09-27 16:50:10] Bedroom doorway | I heard my father standing at the door say: \"The football league has started, come on.\"\n[1975-09-27 16:50:20] Bedroom | I still didn't look into his eyes. I said: \"I don't want to watch.\" I heard my father say unhappily: \"Now you're being defiant, aren't you?\"\n[1975-09-27 16:51:00] Bedroom | I felt him step into the room, grab my arm, and yank me to my feet. Then he let go. I heard him order: \"Let's go.\"\n[1975-09-27 16:51:10] Bedroom | I stood stubbornly in place. I shouted: \"I don't want to watch the football league!\"\n[1975-09-27 16:52:00] Living Room | I saw him clamp onto my arm again without a word. I was dragged out crying, through the hallway, and finally thrown onto the sofa in the living room, right next to my brother.\n[1975-09-27 16:52:10] Living Room | I heard him command: \"Now you sit here and watch the league with us, understand?\"\n[1975-09-27 16:53:00] Living Room | I had thought earlier that if he forced me to watch, I would close my eyes—but now I no longer had the courage.\n[1975-09-27 17:00:00] living room | I sat there, watching as Dad occasionally tossed a piece of candy to me or my brother. I knew he had bought a bag of Glacier mints and a bag of English toffee today. I knew this kind of toffee was my favorite treat.\n[1975-09-27 17:10:00] living room | I sat there without even touching the candies. I realized that my silent resistance had finally angered Dad.\n[1975-09-27 17:10:10] living room | I heard Dad command, \"Eat your candy.\" I stubbornly replied, \"I don't want to eat it.\"\n[1975-09-27 17:11:00] living room | I saw him stand up, and I started crying again. I heard him say sternly, \"Eat your candy now.\" Through sobs, I cried out, \"No, I won't eat it. I don't want to eat it.\"\n[1975-09-27 17:11:10] living room | I felt him grab my arm and squeeze it tightly. I heard him growl, \"Eat all your candy right now!\"\n[1975-09-27 17:11:20] living room | Through hiccups and sobs, I stammered, \"I—don’t—want—the…candy.\"\n[1975-09-27 17:11:30] living room | I felt him press his hand hard against the back of my head, pushing my face forward until it was almost touching the table.\n[1975-09-27 17:11:40] living room | I heard him order in my ear, \"The candy is right there, see it? You will eat it. Right now.\"\n[1975-09-27 17:12:00] living room | I looked at him standing beside me. I could only pick up a piece of toffee and put it in my mouth. I said, \"Yes.\" Then I felt him release his grip.\n[1975-09-28 08:00:00] Vesfjord | I knew tomorrow morning we were going to Vesfjord to visit Grandfather and Grandmother. As far as I knew, we usually went there for dinner on match days, then Dad, my brother, and Grandfather would go to the stadium, while I had to stay behind with Grandmother because I was still too young.\n[1975-09-28 08:05:00] at home | I saw Dad wearing a brown tweed jacket and a white shirt, and Mom in a blue dress. I noticed that both my brother and I were wearing corduroy pants—his were brown, mine were blue.\n[1975-09-28 08:10:00] outdoors | I saw the sky covered with pale grayish-white clouds. Before me lay the parched, ashen-gray road and gravel; the trunks of the pine trees by the roadside looked dry too, tinged slightly with red.\n[1975-09-28 08:15:00] in the car | My brother and I climbed into the back seat, watching our parents sit in front. I saw Dad light a cigarette. I hid in the shadow behind Dad's seat. Every time the car reached a downhill intersection, I would clasp my hands and silently pray in my heart: Dear God, please don't let us have an accident today. Amen.\n[1975-09-28 08:15:10] in the car | I silently repeated in my heart: Dear God, please don't let us have an accident today. Amen.\n[1975-09-28 08:20:00] in the car | I knew that during every long trip like this, I would pray. As far as I knew, Dad drove very fast and always liked to overtake cars ahead. I also heard Mom say he was an excellent driver. I realized fear gripped me tightly whenever the car accelerated or changed lanes.\n[1975-09-28 08:30:00] in the car | I learned that Mom drove very cautiously and considerately toward others. I also realized that for Dad, speed and anger seemed to go hand in hand. I remembered how Mom always patiently followed slow vehicles without getting upset, which made me feel safe.\n[1975-09-28 08:35:00] at home | I knew Mom rarely got angry. I learned she was always willing to help and would prepare delicious treats like pancakes and cocoa for us. She never minded small accidents like broken things.\n[1975-09-28 08:40:00] at home | I learned Dad’s philosophy was to eliminate everything non-essential: eating existed merely for survival, and no talking was allowed while watching TV. I knew his worldview was extremely strict. I realized that, in his eyes, the time spent eating itself held little value.\n[1975-09-28 08:45:00] the garden | I saw the wide, inviting lawn in the garden. I knew we had to walk only on the stone path when entering the garden, as that was the original intention when the path was laid. I learned that running, jumping, or even stepping on the lawn was strictly forbidden.\n[1975-09-28 08:50:00] at home | I knew my brother and I were never allowed to have birthday parties—cutting a piece of cake after dinner was enough. As far as I knew, we couldn’t bring friends inside either, for fear of making the house messy. I realized our friends might already have spread stories about our household.\n[1975-09-28 08:55:00] in the car | I realized this logic of 'streamlining essentials' could explain everything happening at home.\n[1975-09-28 09:00:00] at home | I knew none of us were allowed to touch any of Dad's tools. As far as I knew, we weren't permitted to cook or even turn on the TV by ourselves. I understood these rules existed to keep everything in its place and used exactly as intended.\n[1975-09-28 09:05:00] in the car | I knew Dad drove according to this same logic—he wanted to get from Rocky to our hometown Vesfjord as quickly as possible, allowing no delays. I realized in his logic, every minute of delay on the journey was superfluous.\n[1975-09-28 09:10:00] in the car | I remembered how fast happy childhood moments had passed, when an hour felt so short. But now, I realized my sense of time had completely changed.\n[1975-09-28 09:15:00] in the car | I felt that when movement is restricted, time passes excruciatingly slowly. Each minute feels like an insurmountable barrier, trapping me within it.\n[1975-09-28 09:20:00] in the car | I saw the car filled with thick smoke exhaled by my parents. I sat in the car feeling utterly miserable. I knew that if my knees touched the back of the seat, Dad would let out an angry hiss. I couldn't think of anything worse than this kind of trip.\n[1975-09-28 09:30:00] in the car | I stared at the road signs flashing past outside the window. I felt time stretching endlessly; each appearance of a road sign seemed so difficult to reach.",

I saw long lawns, forests, and land leading toward Nedne. I was familiar with all the landmarks along this route. I knew Mom’s workplace, the treatment center, was somewhere along the way. I realized we were still far from Fjellvik.\n[1975-09-28 09:50:00] on the road | I looked through the car window toward Grimstad and Kristiansand, my gaze passing over Timenes, the big bridge, and Lunde. I realized the journey still felt impossibly far.\n[1975-09-28 10:00:00] in the car | I sat silently on the back seat, gazing out the window. I watched the ever-changing scenery outside—the islands, skerries, and narrow waterways we passed, deep forests, rivers, and rushing waterfalls. I knew this landscape well. I realized I could clearly remember what kind of scenery would appear at each stage of the journey.\n[1975-09-28 10:10:00] near the zoo | I saw the car pass by the zoo, my eyes fixed intently on the tall wire-mesh fence behind which I hoped to glimpse something. I was awakened from my sleep, hoping to see one or two animals there—I thought it would be a completely free show. After passing by, I drifted back into slumber.\n[1975-09-28 10:30:00] Vesfjord | I watched the car drive into town, passing the pharmacy, the newsstand, and traffic lights, then winding through rows of white wooden houses and narrow roads. On the left side of the road, I saw my grandparents’ yellow house standing there. Tall chestnut trees lined both sides of the road, and many cars were parked along the curb—everything looked so orderly. The familiar yellow building came clearly into view. I knew the contours of this area well; I even remembered that beneath the shop at Åsen lived my cousins Berit and Olaf Olaf. I recognized every landmark around here. I felt as though the car was driving into time itself, and that sense of familiarity made the clock start ticking again in my heart.\n[1975-09-28 10:35:00] grandparents' driveway | I saw Dad drive past the house, then back up, turn into a small alley, and drive straight up the short, steep driveway.\n[1975-09-28 10:40:00] grandparents' front door | I saw Grandma’s face appear at the kitchen window. I got out of the car, stepped onto the red-painted stone steps, and saw her opening the door. The car stopped close to the black wrought-iron garage doors.\n[1975-09-28 10:40:10] grandparents' front door | I heard Grandma call out loudly: “You’re here! Come in!”\n[1975-09-28 10:41:00] hallway | I walked into the small hallway. I heard Grandma say to me: “Believe it or not, I’ve been waiting for you all to come, children!”\n[1975-09-28 10:42:00] hallway | I watched Grandma give Henrik Inge a long hug first, then she pulled me tightly into her arms, rocking me gently back and forth on her shoulder. I felt the warmth of Grandma’s face, and I caught the pleasant scent of her perfume. Even though I turned my face away slightly, deep down I really liked it when she did this.\n[1975-09-28 10:42:10] hallway | As soon as Grandma let go of me, I eagerly told her: “We might have seen a wolf at the zoo!”\n[1975-09-28 10:42:20] hallway | I saw Grandma smile kindly and reach out to ruffle my hair. I heard Grandma laugh in response to what I said.\n[1975-09-28 10:42:30] hallway | I heard Henrik Inge say: “We didn’t see anything—it was just something in Grete Lundnes’s imagination.”\n[1975-09-28 10:42:40] foyer | I felt my grandmother ruffle Henrik's hair too. I heard my grandmother laugh and say, \"Didn't see you there! At least I'm glad to see you now!\"\n[1975-09-28 10:45:00] second floor of grandparents' house | I hung up my coat in the foyer and walked up the stairs to the second floor. I saw a spacious living room on the right and the kitchen on the left. Before me was a hallway covered with blue wall-to-wall carpeting.\n[1975-09-28 10:46:00] beautiful living room | I looked around the unusually bright and spacious living room. I studied the three black-and-white photos from their student days placed on the piano, and the curious little trinkets inside the cabinet. I saw two oil paintings hanging above the piano. Inside the dark glass cabinet, I spotted a glowing model of a Venetian gondola and a brownish glass teapot adorned with something resembling diamonds and gemstones. I knew this beautiful living room was usually only used during Christmas or major holidays. I understood that the souvenirs in the cabinet were items they had brought back from their travels.\n[1975-09-28 10:47:00] second floor of grandparents' house | I looked out the window, across the river toward the city. I noticed sliding doors separating this area from the inner living room. At the far end of the living room, I saw two black leather sofas with a rose-painted corner table between them, and a low table in front of the sofas. I realized we weren’t usually allowed into the formal living room during regular visits, so we went straight to the kitchen.\n[1975-09-28 10:48:00] kitchen / living room | I gazed through the large window. I searched for that familiar landmark on the horizon. Outside the window lay my grandparents’ garden, beyond which flowed the river heading toward the sea. On the distant horizon, the white figure of the Grønningen lighthouse stood out vividly in the light.\n[1975-09-28 10:50:00] grandparents' house | I smelled the aroma of meat patties and brown sauce my grandmother was preparing in the kitchen. A faint sweet scent of fruit lingered in the air, filling the entire house. I thought how wonderful the smell of this house always was. I realized that no matter where I might one day catch this scent again, it would instantly bring back memories of this home—and of Grandfather and Grandmother when they visited us, carrying that familiar fragrance with them.\n[1975-09-28 10:55:00] kitchen | I entered the kitchen and saw Grandfather sitting in his chair. I heard Grandfather say to us, 'You're here? Was traffic good?'\n[1975-09-28 10:55:10] kitchen | I looked at Grandfather. He was wearing a gray knitted cardigan over a blue shirt, and a half-smoked cigar still dangled from his lips. I saw his large belly, his hair neatly combed back, with just one small strand falling over his forehead.\n[1975-09-28 10:55:20] kitchen | I heard Dad reply, 'Yes, smooth all the way.'\n[1975-09-28 10:56:00] kitchen | I heard Grandfather ask, 'How did yesterday’s lottery ticket go?' Dad answered, 'No luck—seven was the best number.' Then I heard Grandfather say, 'I won twenty kroner.' Dad replied, 'That’s not bad.'\n[1975-09-28 10:57:00] kitchen | I heard my grandfather complain, \"My numbers seven and eleven were both useless. That last moment was so unlucky—the goal was scored after the match whistle!\"\n[1975-09-28 10:58:00] kitchen | I heard my grandmother by the electric stove ask my father, \"Have you heard what one of Erling's students said to him the other day when he came here?\" My father said, \"No.\"\n[1975-09-28 10:59:00] kitchen | I heard my father reply briefly, \"No.\"\n[1975-09-28 11:00:00] kitchen | I watched as my grandmother laughed, putting down her work to share the story with us. I heard my grandmother imitate the student’s voice: \"'Did you win the lottery?' Erling said, 'No, why do you ask?' 'You look like you're over the moon,' the student said.\" I saw that my father couldn’t help but laugh at this point.\n[1975-09-28 11:01:00] kitchen | I heard my grandmother ask, \"Wouldn't you like a cup of coffee?\" My mother replied, \"Ah, yes, thank you, I'd love a cup.\" Then I heard my grandmother suggest, \"Then let's sit in the living room downstairs.\"\n[1975-09-28 11:02:00] kitchen | I heard Henrik Inge ask, \"Can we go upstairs and get some magazines?\" My grandmother answered, \"Of course you can, just don't rummage around everywhere!\" I heard my brother promise, \"We won't.\"\n[1975-09-28 11:05:00] staircase | I carefully walked along the hallway and climbed up the stairs toward the third floor. I could hear the wooden steps creaking under my feet. I knew running was strictly forbidden in this house.",

    "text": "[1975-09-28 11:10:00] attic | I entered the large attic and saw many cardboard boxes stacked against the walls. I rummaged through the old items and found old toys and spare parts. Before me stood an old mangle machine and an antique sewing machine. I saw cardboard boxes filled with old periodicals dating back to the 1950s. I realized these magazines were left over from my father’s childhood. As far as I knew, there were also tin spinning tops and old robot-building parts hidden somewhere here.\n[1975-09-28 11:30:00] attic / living room | I gathered a big stack of magazines, went downstairs, sat down, and began reading intently. I kept my eyes fixed on the picture magazines until my grandmother called us for lunch. I heard my grandmother say gently, \"Please come and eat.\" I realized these magazines held immense fascination for me—since I couldn’t take them home, I wanted to devour them all in one sitting.\n[1975-09-28 13:00:00] kitchen / living room | I watched my grandmother washing dishes in the kitchen while my mother helped dry them. I saw my grandfather sitting at the table reading his newspaper, and my father standing by the living room window gazing into the distance.\n[1975-09-28 13:10:00] living room / garden | I watched my grandmother walk into the living room and approach Dad. I heard my grandmother ask Dad if he would go with her to the garden; she said she wanted to show him something.\n[1975-09-28 13:20:00] kitchen | I saw Mom and Grandfather sitting together at the table, mostly silent. I occasionally heard them exchange a few quiet words.\n[1975-09-28 13:30:00] first floor | I stood up and prepared to go to the bathroom. I thought the restroom was on the first floor, and I really didn't like going there, but I'd been holding it for too long—I couldn't wait any longer.\n[1975-09-28 13:31:00] first-floor hallway / restroom | I came into the hallway, went down the creaking wooden stairs, hurried across the carpeted living room, and entered the restroom. Behind the tightly closed doors, everything was quiet; the rooms looked empty.\n[1975-09-28 13:32:00] restroom | I reached out to turn on the light. The restroom was pitch dark. I felt my heart tremble nervously in the seconds before the light came on. Even after the light flickered to life, I still felt afraid.\n[1975-09-28 13:33:00] restroom | I urinated against the inner rim of the toilet bowl. I deliberately ignored the sound of urine splashing on the water, trying instead to focus all my attention on listening for any other noises outside.\n[1975-09-28 13:34:00] restroom | After washing my hands, I quickly pressed the small black flush lever. I realized I had to get out before the loud flushing sound began—I absolutely couldn't stay inside the house when that noise started.\n[1975-09-28 13:35:00] stairs / kitchen | I yanked hard on the handle, then sprinted down the hallway, practically flying up the stairs. I ran into the kitchen. A roaring flush echoed from the water tank. Everything on the first floor seemed to silently threaten me in the dimness. I felt intensely uneasy, as if something were chasing me from behind. I shouldn't have run on the stairs, but I didn't care anymore.\n[1975-09-28 14:00:00] outside grandparents' house | I saw crowds beginning to move through the alley outside. Dad, Mom, and Henrik Inge were also getting ready. I realized the crowd was moving toward the stadium.\n[1975-09-28 14:10:00] by the window | Through the window, I saw Grandfather glide down the slope on his bicycle. He always set off after everyone else. I saw Grandfather wearing his gray coat, a rust-red scarf, a cap, and black gloves.\n[1975-09-28 14:20:00] kitchen | I watched as Grandmother took bread from the refrigerator and placed it on the table. I knew this bread was meant to be eaten when they came home.\n[1975-09-28 14:30:00] kitchen | I saw Grandmother give me a slightly mischievous smile. I heard her say, \"I'm going to give you something.\" I asked her what it was, and she mysteriously told me, \"Just wait and see—close your eyes!\"\n[1975-09-28 14:31:00] kitchen | I obediently closed my eyes and heard her rummaging through a drawer. Then I felt her standing in front of me. I heard Grandmother say, \"Now you can open your eyes and look!\"\n[1975-09-28 14:32:00] kitchen | I opened my eyes and saw a triangular piece of chocolate. I asked in delight, \"Is this for me? All of it?\" I heard her answer affirmatively, \"Yes.\" I thought this must be that especially delicious kind of chocolate.\n[1975-09-28 14:33:00] kitchen | I asked uncertainly, \"Not for Henrik Inge?\" I heard Grandmother reply gently, \"No, not this time. He’s already gone off to watch the match. You should have some fun too, shouldn’t you!\"\n[1975-09-28 14:34:00] kitchen | I tore off the stiff paper wrapper and saw the chocolate inside, wrapped in gold foil. I smiled at her and said, \"Thank you so much.\" I heard Grandmother wink at me and say, \"Well then, don’t tell Henrik Inge—this is our secret.\"\n[1975-09-28 14:40:00] kitchen | I chewed the chocolate in my mouth. I saw Grandmother sit down and begin concentrating on her crossword puzzle. I said to Grandmother, \"We’re going to get a telephone soon.\"\n[1975-09-28 14:41:00] kitchen | I heard Grandmother say, \"Oh really? Then we’ll be able to talk on the phone.\" I nodded and said, \"Yes, we were actually quite far down the list, but we got it installed anyway because Dad is in politics.\"\n[1975-09-28 14:42:00] kitchen | I heard Grandmother laugh and ask, \"In politics, is he?\" I asked her confidently, \"Right? He works in the government, doesn’t he?\" She answered, \"Yes, that’s right.\"\n[1975-09-28 14:45:00] kitchen | I nodded at Grandmother. I heard Grandmother ask, \"Do you think school is fun?\" I replied, \"Yes, very fun.\" When she asked what I liked most, I shouted, \"Recess!\" I said this because I knew it would make her laugh out loud, or at least smile.\n[1975-09-28 15:00:00] attic | I finished eating the chocolate. I saw her immersed in her crossword puzzle again. I went up to the attic to bring down some of the toys.\n[1975-09-28 15:30:00] kitchen | After a while, I noticed her glance in my direction. I heard her ask if we should go watch the ball game too. I thought I would like to go.\n[1975-09-28 15:40:00] outside the garage | We got dressed. I saw her push the bicycle out of the garage. I sat on the rear luggage rack, and she sat on the saddle, one foot on the ground. I saw her turn toward me. I heard her ask, \"Ready?\" I called back loudly, \"Ready.\"\n[1975-09-28 15:45:00] on the road | I wrapped my arms around her. I felt her push off the ground with one foot to get the bike moving, then place her foot on the pedal. I felt the bike glide down a gentle slope, make a right turn, and then she began pedaling hard forward.\n[1975-09-28 15:46:00] on the road | I nodded first, then answered aloud. I heard her ask, \"Are you holding on tight?\" I said, \"Yes, I'm sitting fine.\" I remembered she couldn't see me nod, so I spoke up.\n[1975-09-28 15:50:00] on the road | I felt how good it was to hold onto her like this. I knew Grandmother was the only one who would take my brother and me for bike rides, and the only one who would hug us, gently stroke our arms, and play with us. I felt that I really was sitting well, and that riding with her was great fun.\n[1975-09-28 15:55:00] on the road | As far as I knew, Dad would play with us during Christmas, but always did what he wanted to do. I also knew Mom would join in. I realized Grandmother was different—she was willing to do what we wanted, like puzzles or chemistry experiments.\n[1975-09-28 16:00:00] uphill road | I felt the bicycle wheels slow down more and more until they stopped completely. I saw Grandmother get off and begin pushing the bike uphill. I heard her say, \"You can just stay seated if you'd like.\"\n[1975-09-28 16:10:00] downhill road | I sat on the bike looking out at the city, feeling the bike move forward steadily. At the top, I felt her get back on. We glided down the gentle slope toward the stadium. I heard Grandmother's slightly heavy breathing beside me.",

    "text": "[1975-09-28 16:15:00] near the stadium | Suddenly I heard a loud, beast-like roar, mixed with clapping. I felt the wave of sound rising higher and higher.\n[1975-09-28 16:20:00] outside the stadium wall | I saw my grandmother park the car by the wall near the wooden boards. I stood on the luggage rack as she told me to, feeling her hands supporting my body. I looked into the stadium field and saw everything happening inside.\n[1975-09-28 16:30:00] outside the stadium wall | I gazed at the green grass, seeing players in yellow and white jerseys, and a dark, surging sea of people moving constantly. I felt the atmosphere of the stadium deeply drawing me in. I thought this feeling had already taken root inside me and would stay with me for the coming days.\n[1975-09-28 17:30:00] kitchen | After returning home, I saw my grandmother start preparing dinner. Soon, I saw the front door open and my grandfather walk back in with a stern expression. I heard my grandmother ask him as soon as she saw him, \"Did you lose?\"\n[1975-09-28 17:31:00] kitchen | I saw him nod and sit down in his chair. I saw her pour him a cup of coffee.\n[1975-09-28 17:35:00] kitchen | I saw my grandmother occasionally wink at us. I also noticed that my grandfather would look at us, smile, and shake his head toward her. I knew my grandmother always took care of my grandfather, but often mocked and teased him. I came to understand their bickering way of interacting. I didn't fully understand exactly what their power dynamic was like.\n[1975-09-28 18:00:00] kitchen | I saw Mom, Dad, and my brother come home. I heard my grandmother repeat the question, \"I heard you lost?\" Dad said, \"Yes. But even the most victorious can suffer defeat sometimes, don't you think, Father?\" Then I heard my grandfather mutter something.\n[1975-09-28 19:00:00] doorway | As we were leaving, I saw we were given a large bag of plums, pears, and bread. I saw my grandfather say goodbye from upstairs—he didn’t get up from his chair. I saw my grandmother come downstairs with us and give each of us a long hug. I looked back at her waving from the steps until she disappeared from view.\n[1975-09-28 19:30:00] in the car | I sat in the back seat looking forward. I heard hushed voices from the front seats. I saw the bright dashboard and the treetops, rocks, and estuary illuminated by the headlights cutting through the darkness. I thought it strange—how the journey home always seemed shorter than the trip there. I truly loved the feeling of driving forward through the night.\n[1975-09-28 20:30:00] front door | We arrived home at night. I heard the crunch of boots on the gravel path, the sharp clang of car doors closing, and the rustling of keys. I saw the hallway light illuminating nearby familiar objects. I felt that arriving at your destination in the night was always something especially pleasant.\n[1975-09-28 20:31:00] hallway | I noticed the shoelace holes looked like eyes, the tongue like a forehead. I saw the white socket on the wall staring coldly, and the coat rack in the corner silently turning away.\n[1975-09-28 20:35:00] bedroom | I walked into my room. I saw ballpoint pens and pencils stuck in the pencil holder. I thought these pens were like a group of students gathered together, some scattered outside, as if spitting to show complete indifference to everything.\n[1975-09-28 20:40:00] bedroom | I saw the neatly smoothed bedspread and pillows. I noticed the lamp’s staring gaze, saw the keyhole like a mouth, the screws on the metal plate like eyes, and the doorknob like a strange plastic nose. I thought the bedspread and pillows would probably be happy if they could be rearranged.\n[1975-09-28 21:00:00] bedroom | I brushed my teeth. I called out goodnight to Mom and Dad. I got into bed, ready to enjoy half an hour of reading time.\n[1975-09-28 21:05:00] bedroom | I know I have two favorite books. One is 'Doctor Dolittle,' and I know the story about his long journey across Africa where he discovered the two-headed sausage worm.\n[1975-09-28 21:10:00] bedroom | I know the other book is 'The Marvelous Frecci.' I know the story about the little girl who could balance on fountains and whale spouts.\n[1975-09-28 21:15:00] bedroom | Tonight I pulled out 'The Little Witch' from the pile of books. I flipped through its illustrations. After finishing, I turned off the light, rested my head on the pillow, and closed my eyes. I thought I was so familiar with this story that I only needed to look at the pictures.\n[1975-09-28 22:00:00] bedroom | A doorbell rang in my ears: 'Ding—dong.' I was almost asleep. I felt as if I had suddenly snapped back onto the bed and into the room.\n[1975-09-28 22:00:10] bedroom | As far as I know, besides expected guests, no one usually rings the doorbell at this hour. I wondered who it could possibly be. I murmured to myself—surely no one would ring the doorbell this late.\n[1975-09-28 22:05:00] bedroom | I sat up in bed. I heard Mom passing through the hallway and going downstairs. Then I heard her come back upstairs, whispering a few words to Dad. After that, I heard her go downstairs again, close the door, and start the car outside. I thought she must have been getting dressed there, preparing to go out.\n[1975-09-28 22:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I climbed out of bed, carefully opened my door, slipped through the hallway, and entered my brother's room. I heard Dad walking downstairs to his office. I silently exclaimed: Good heavens, what’s happening? It’s nearly ten o’clock—where is she going?\n[1975-09-28 22:11:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw him lying on the bed reading a book, still dressed. I saw him smile slightly and sit up when he noticed me. I heard him say, \"Came in just wearing your underwear?\"\n[1975-09-28 22:12:00] Henrik Inge's room | I quickly asked, \"Who rang the doorbell?\" I heard my brother say, \"I think it was Mrs. Oskar Magnus, with all those kids.\"\n[1975-09-28 22:13:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw my brother shrug his shoulders. I pressed on, \"Now? Why? Why did Mom drive off? Where could she have gone?\" I heard him say, \"I guess she took them to some of their relatives.\"\n[1975-09-28 22:14:00] Henrik Inge's room | I kept asking why. My brother told me, \"Oskar Magnus was drunk. Didn't you hear how he was shouting and yelling behind them?\"\n[1975-09-28 22:15:00] Henrik Inge's room | I shook my head. I saw my brother nod. I asked, \"Did Toya Moen come too? And Helen Stergård?\" I murmured under my breath, \"Damn it.\" I realized I must have fallen asleep earlier.\n[1975-09-28 22:16:00] Henrik Inge's room | I heard my brother say, \"Dad will probably come upstairs again soon—you'd better go back and lie down. I'm going to sleep now too.\" I said, \"OK. Good night.\" He replied, \"Good night.\"\n[1975-09-28 22:20:00] Bedroom | I returned to my room, pulled open the curtains, and looked toward the neighbor's house. I didn't see anything unusual. I felt a complete silence outside.\n[1975-09-28 22:25:00] Bedroom | I had heard him shouting and roaring from the window out onto the lawn. I knew it was common knowledge that Oskar Magnus drank—heavily—and we had gone spying before. I also remembered that Toya Moen used to just laugh it off. I thought this time might be different—after all, they actually fled, which had never happened before.\n[1975-09-29 07:00:00] Bedroom | I woke up for the second time in the morning. I heard movement in the bathroom. I heard the sound of Mom's car rumbling along the road outside. I knew Mom had an early shift today. I figured the person in the bathroom must be my brother.\n[1975-09-29 07:05:00] Bedroom | I heard my brother shut the bathroom door and enter his room, then heard him walk downstairs. It suddenly occurred to me—I hadn't even asked where his bicycle was. I realized he must have left so early because he couldn't ride it and had to walk to school instead.\n[1975-09-29 07:15:00] bathroom / kitchen | I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash up. I got dressed and walked into the kitchen. I saw that Dad had already placed three slices of bread and a glass of milk at my seat. I knew he hadn't poured out his washing water again today—he wanted me to use it next.",

    "text": "[1975-09-29 07:20:00] kitchen / living room | I saw that the leftover food had been cleared away. I saw Dad sitting in the living room. The sound of the radio came through in the background. I smelled cigarette smoke.\n[1975-09-29 07:25:00] kitchen | I saw that it was raining outside. I heard the raindrops tapping against the windowpanes, sounding like little drumbeats. I knew this was the usual seasonal rain.\n[1975-09-29 07:30:00] kitchen | I knew Monday was the only day when no one was home after school. That’s why I’d been given a key hanging around my neck.\n[1975-09-29 07:35:00] kitchen | I noticed a small window in the basement room that looked like an opening. I came up with a plan for dealing with bad weather—I thought the window was big enough for me to crawl through.\n[1975-09-29 07:36:00] kitchen | I saw the window was about half a meter above my head, leading out to the grass. I planned to open the window in the morning, then after school, stand on the trash can and climb into the basement. That way, I could get inside without anyone knowing I couldn’t unlock the door.\n[1975-09-29 07:37:00] kitchen | I knew it was perfectly natural to go down to the basement for a raincoat on rainy days. I figured I could quietly unhook the window latch while getting the raincoat and definitely wouldn’t be noticed. But I reminded myself never to do anything so stupid if Dad was standing in the hallway.\n[1975-09-29 07:40:00] basement | I finished breakfast, brushed my teeth in the bathroom. I went back to my room, picked up my backpack, went downstairs, and entered that small, warm room. I stood there quietly for several seconds.\n[1975-09-29 07:41:00] basement | When I heard no movement on the stairs, I leaned out and quickly unhooked the latch.\n[1975-09-29 07:45:00] front door / outside Karl Larsdal's house | I put on my raincoat, slung my backpack over my shoulder, and stepped into the hallway. I saw the blue-and-white Viking boots sitting there. I called out to Dad and ran out the door, walking over to Karl Larsdal’s place, where I saw him sticking his head out the window. I heard Karl shout that he was still eating breakfast but would be down soon. Looking down at the boots, I thought to myself that what I really wanted most was a pair of pure white ones.\n[1975-09-29 07:50:00] Karl Larsdal's driveway | I walked over to a puddle on their driveway and began throwing stones into it. I noticed that their driveway was made of hard, reddish soil mixed with many small round stones, completely different from the gravel or tiles commonly seen at other houses.\n[1975-09-29 07:55:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I saw there was no lawn behind their house, only a small vegetable patch growing potatoes, carrots, turnips, radishes, and other vegetables. As far as I knew, their family was quite different from the neighbors in many ways.\n[1975-09-29 08:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house | On the side near the woods, I saw a stone fence, and beside it a compost bin filled with kitchen waste. I knew that stone fence had been built by Presbakkmo himself. From what I understood, they didn't throw away all their garbage like we did; instead, they saved milk cartons and egg boxes for reuse.\n[1975-09-29 08:01:00] Karl Larsdal's driveway | I straightened up and stared at the cement mixer. I saw that the mixer’s round green head was partly covered with a white tarp, looking as if wrapped in a scarf. Its open feeding hopper resembled a toothless gaping mouth. I couldn’t help wondering—what had this wide-eyed machine seen?\n[1975-09-29 08:02:00] Karl Larsdal's driveway | I saw Karlsen’s father driving up the slope in his green Taunus car, and noticed him give a slight wave from behind the steering wheel. I greeted him first.\n[1975-09-29 08:02:10] Karl Larsdal's driveway | Suddenly, Ingeborg Lofnes appeared in my mind. I felt a surge of intense joy rising from my stomach, spreading through my chest as if exploding inside me.\n[1975-09-29 08:02:20] Karl Larsdal's driveway | I remembered Lilund said she was sick. I knew she hadn’t come to school on Friday. Today was already Monday. I thought she must be recovered by now. I silently pleaded: Oh, she must be healthy again!\n[1975-09-29 08:03:00] Karl Larsdal's driveway | I rushed frantically up the hill toward Yenhaug Supermarket. My mind was consumed with the desire to see her. I missed her dark, shining eyes and her sweet, cheerful voice.\n[1975-09-29 08:03:10] Karl Larsdal's front door | I shouted loudly: 'Karl Larsdal! Hurry up!'\n[1975-09-29 08:04:00] Karl Larsdal's front door | I watched as he then opened the door and stepped out. I heard his muffled voice from inside the house.\n[1975-09-29 08:04:10] Karl Larsdal's doorstep | We agreed to take the small path. I heard him ask, 'Shall we take the small path?' I replied, 'Take the small path.'\n[1975-09-29 08:10:00] Path behind the house | We climbed over the stone wall and ran into the path, leaping between tilted hay piles to keep our balance. Sometimes I had to brace myself with my hands to avoid falling, watching helplessly as water crept up my sleeves. I saw that the path was made up of countless clumps of grass and narrow passages. I noticed the rain-soaked ground resembled a swamp, so soggy that even with boots it was extremely difficult to cross. With every step into a puddle, water spilled over the edges of my boots.\n[1975-09-29 08:10:00] In front of Ingeborg Lofnes's house | We walked past the houses of Myrvang and Lilund, arriving at the gravel yard in front of Ingeborg Lofnes's house. I saw a fine curtain of water dripping steadily along the roadside. Through the mist, I glimpsed Ingeborg’s house atop the hill. A window on the top floor was lit. On the other side of the road stood a dark, damp, cold oak forest. I noticed the light above the gate was also on. I wondered if that lit window might be her room?\n[1975-09-29 08:11:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | We stood side by side in front of the door. I suggested to Karl, 'Will you ring the doorbell?'\n[1975-09-29 08:11:10] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I watched Karl Larsdal rise onto his toes and press the doorbell. A few seconds later, I saw her mother come and open the door. At that moment, I felt my heart tremble slightly inside my chest.\n[1975-09-29 08:11:20] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I asked, 'Is Ingeborg Lofnes at home?'\n[1975-09-29 08:11:30] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I heard her mother reply, 'Yes.'\n[1975-09-29 08:11:40] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I heard Karl explain, 'We’re her classmates. We have homework to give her.'\n[1975-09-29 08:11:50] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I heard her mother say politely, 'That’s very kind of you. Would you like to come in?'\n[1975-09-29 08:12:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I kept my eyes on her mother. I saw she had light-colored hair and blue eyes—though she looked nothing like Ingeborg, she seemed pleasant and comforting.\n[1975-09-29 08:12:10] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I heard her mother shout, \"Ingeborg Lofnes! Your classmates are here!\"\n[1975-09-29 08:12:20] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I heard Ingeborg call back from upstairs, \"I'm coming!\"\n[1975-09-29 08:12:30] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I asked worriedly, \"Is she sick?\"\n[1975-09-29 08:12:40] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I saw her mother shake her head. I heard her explain that the illness had passed, but they’d kept her home an extra day just to be safe.\n[1975-09-29 08:13:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes come into view, holding a slice of bread and smiling at us with food still in her mouth. I murmured, \"Ah, yes.\" I heard cheerful footsteps on the stairs.\n[1975-09-29 08:13:10] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I heard her greet us, \"Hi!\"\n[1975-09-29 08:13:20] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I told her, \"We thought you were sick.\"\n[1975-09-29 08:13:30] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I heard Karl add, \"We brought your homework.\"\n[1975-09-29 08:13:40] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I looked her over carefully. I saw she was wearing a white turtleneck sweater with red patterns and blue pants. I noticed a faint smear of white milk residue just above her lip.\n[1975-09-29 08:14:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I heard her ask eagerly, \"So, can you go out and play with me? I've been stuck at home all day!\"\n[1975-09-29 08:14:10] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I looked at Karl to ask for his opinion. I readily agreed, saying, \"Sure, what do you say, Karl Larsdal?\"\n[1975-09-29 08:14:20] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I heard Karl reply firmly, \"Yes.\"",

    "text": "[1975-09-29 08:15:00] Football field / Wide path | Laughing and shouting, we crossed the muddy football field and stepped onto a broader dirt road. I saw the ground covered by a thick blanket of fallen leaves, with yellow, red, and brown hues woven together. Long, grayish-yellow grass lay limp on the soil. I noticed occasional faint green glimmers peeking through the leaves.\n[1975-09-29 08:15:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I saw her putting on her white boots and red raincoat, and I saw her mother walking up the stairs.\n[1975-09-29 08:15:10] Ingeborg Lofnes's doorstep | I saw her bounce out the door, and we started joyfully hopping around too. I heard her call out to her mom, \"Bye!\"\n[1975-09-29 08:16:00] Gravel path | I saw her suddenly turn toward us at the end of the gravel path. I heard her ask, \"What should we do? Shall we go down to Lilund's?\"\n[1975-09-29 08:20:00] Below the cliff | I saw old utility poles standing against the bare cliff face. Below was a quiet oak forest, and about a hundred meters deep into it, I spotted the wreckage of an old, battered car. As far as I knew, that car was in much worse condition than the ones we usually played with. I knew the place was so secluded that almost no one ever went there.\n[1975-09-29 08:20:00] Outside Lilund's house | We went to Lilund's house. Karl and I held the rubber band while watching them skillfully jumping in the middle. I heard Ingeborg suggest playing rubber band jumping. I learned that their technique in rubber band jumping was flawless; their complex moves left me dazzled.\n[1975-09-29 08:25:00] At the wrecked car | I smelled the musty odor of the old car wreckage in the damp woods. I saw the detached window frames hanging down like tentacles, and glass shards scattered across the rubber mat like tiny diamonds. I felt that although this stale smell was strong, compared to the scent of rotting leaves, it somehow seemed a bit 'fresh'.\n[1975-09-29 08:26:00] At the wrecked car | I reached out and shook the black rubber mat, seeing a swarm of crawling insects scatter in panic. I saw spiders and woodlice fleeing in alarm. I noticed that all three pedals inside the driver’s cabin had completely failed.\n[1975-09-29 08:27:00] wreckage of an abandoned car | I felt water droplets shaken loose by the wind pass through the broken window and strike my face. I thought these droplets were probably shaken from nearby leaves by the wind.\n[1975-09-29 08:28:00] wreckage of an abandoned car | As far as I know, we once found beer bottles, pornographic magazines, and various discarded plastic barrels nearby. I clearly remember finding a pair of underwear covered in filth one time. Thinking about how someone would just throw soiled underwear there, my friends and I couldn't stop laughing back then.\n[1975-09-29 08:29:00] woods | I saw that the feces in the woods were sometimes surrounded by beetles or flies. I know we often defecated during our hikes, choosing spots beneath trees, along cliffs, or beside streams. I learned it was merely to observe the changes and colors of our waste. I was curious about how the feces glistened among the heather, wondering what they might feel like.\n[1975-09-29 08:30:00] woods | I know we occasionally returned to check old 'outposts.' Sometimes they were gone, sometimes dried up or softened. I learned that outdoor feces had an especially pungent smell. I noticed how those excretions spread out in the forest looked almost melted.\n[1975-09-29 08:30:00] outside Lilund's house | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes walk toward me to demonstrate the movement, and I felt her hand rest on my shoulder. The moment she touched me, I felt a jolt like electricity ripple through my entire body.\n[1975-09-29 08:35:00] playground hillside | We crossed the playground, climbed the steep slope, and stepped over the stone blocks. I saw the rusted swings and the rotting empty sandbox below the hill. Across the road, Rockhaug Supermarket came into view. I realized it was time for school—I didn’t have any more time to linger.\n[1975-09-29 08:35:00] outside Lilund's house | When I did the movement wrong, I saw her burst into laughter at me, and I felt a strand of her hair brush past my face. I heard her clear, bright laughter. I gazed into her dark, shining eyes and caught the fresh scent of her hair. I was immersed in the sensory impact she created within me.\n[1975-09-29 08:36:00] outside Lilund's house | I sincerely felt that everything was simply too wonderful. At that moment, everything around me seemed utterly perfect.\n[1975-09-29 08:40:00] in front of Rockhaug Supermarket | I searched everywhere for Ingeborg’s figure. I saw the backpack line at the supermarket entrance stretching long, and several girls jumping rope under the eaves. A steady light rain was falling. Not finding her there, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of disappointment.\n[1975-09-29 08:40:00] outside Lilund's house | I saw the sky above grow thick and dark, with a blackish-blue hue seeping through the gray clouds. The sky hanging over the woods resembled a wall, and then, I felt the first drops of rain fall.\n[1975-09-29 08:45:00] bus | I saw the bus drive up the hill. I noticed Karl Larsdal and Toya Moen hopping across the street, arriving just in time at the meeting point. Finally, I boarded the bus with everyone else and sat in the very last seat. I watched as the vehicle turned into the asphalt square outside the supermarket.\n[1975-09-29 08:45:00] outside Lilund's house | I pulled the hood of my raincoat over my head and continued jumping rope with my friends. I saw the light atop the post at the end of the driveway suddenly turn on. I felt raindrops hitting my hood and trickling down my cheeks. I heard the gravel beneath my feet crunching underfoot.\n[1975-09-29 08:50:00] bus | I stepped inside and knelt on the seat, looking back toward the rear. I saw a thick layer of mist forming on the large glass windows. I realized Ingeborg wasn't there. I felt as though the world had become incomplete, as if everything had lost its meaning.\n[1975-09-29 08:50:00] outside Lilund's house | I saw a car slowly drive up the hill. I heard Ingeborg Lofnes say, \"That's Dad!\"\n[1975-09-29 08:51:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's driveway | I saw a Volvo station wagon come to a stop at the far end of the driveway. I noticed a tall, strong man with a black beard step out. I watched as Ingeborg ran toward him, and he bent down to embrace her before they both went inside the house.\n[1975-09-29 08:52:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I heard her ask, \"Now we're going to have dinner—what's the homework?\"\n[1975-09-29 08:53:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's front door | I saw her nod at me, then disappear into the house. I told her the homework assignment, and I heard her say goodbye to me.\n[1975-09-29 08:54:00] outside Lilund's house | I saw Lilund standing there, gathering and coiling up the rubber rope. I heard Lilund say, \"I have to go now too.\" I noticed a hint of disappointment in her eyes.\n[1975-09-29 08:54:10] outside Lilund's house | I replied, \"We're leaving too.\"\n[1975-09-29 08:55:00] bus | I thought that now I would have to spend an entire day without seeing her—and the next day too. I realized that because I hadn't seen Lilund, I had no way of knowing how her illness was progressing.\n[1975-09-29 08:56:00] crossroads / store | I ran to the store together with Karl Larsdal. When I arrived at the crossroads, I suggested, \"Let's keep running all the way to the store.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:00:00] school | I saw the car parked outside the school. I ran across the playground and waited under the shelter. After the class bell rang, I lined up and followed everyone into the classroom.\n[1975-09-29 09:00:00] ring road | I followed Karl Larsdal along a path, over a small hill, and onto the ring road. I heard Karl suggest that instead of going home the same way we came or through the woods, we should walk down the main road to Holt and then follow the ring road back home.",

    "text": "[1975-09-29 09:05:00] school | I knew the students from the parallel class felt superior to us because they were locals who knew everything about the place. As far as I could tell, it was their school and their teachers. I realized that to them, we were just some kind of unauthorized immigrants. I felt I had already become fairly familiar with the appearance and rumors surrounding most people in the class.\n[1975-09-29 09:05:00] ring road | I walked along the road, absentmindedly glanced back, and was startled to see Henrik Inge sitting in the window of a bus just a few meters behind me! I saw the bus driving downhill. I was full of suspicion: What on earth was he up to? Why was he going into town now? What was he doing there?\n[1975-09-29 09:05:10] ring road | I kept turning it over in my mind—why was he going into town at this time, and what exactly was he planning to do?\n[1975-09-29 09:05:20] ring road | I said to Karl Larsdal, \"That's Henrik Inge—he's sitting in the bus.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:06:00] main road | I crossed the lawn in front of a house and stepped onto the main road. I heard Karl Larsdal say, uninterested, \"Oh, really.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:07:00] main road | I heard Karl say, \"It was really fun up there.\" I replied, \"Yes, shall we go back up again sometime?\"\n[1975-09-29 09:08:00] main road | I heard Karl say, \"Okay, but maybe we shouldn't tell anyone else about it? They're girls, after all.\" I responded, \"No, no need to tell anyone now.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:10:00] school | I learned that the boys living on the east side of the island were rougher and more prone to fighting than us. As far as I knew, apart from Asle Karl Larsdal and Helen Ster, the rest of us were often pushed and pulled around at their whim. I recalled the feeling of suddenly having an arm lock around my neck and being thrown to the ground, and I still felt a lingering fear.\n[1975-09-29 09:10:00] top of the hill | I looked down from the top of the hill and saw my dad's car parked outside the house. I also noticed that Karl Larsdal's father had already come home. I knew they were both teachers, so they finished work earlier than most other parents.\n[1975-09-29 09:10:10] top of the hill | I thought again about that plan to climb through the window using the trash can.\n[1975-09-29 09:11:00] top of the hill | I suggested, \"Should we find something else to do? Go somewhere else? Down to that shaky tree over there?\"\n[1975-09-29 09:12:00] top of the hill | I saw Karl Larsdal shake his head and heard him say, \"It's raining. And I'm hungry. I'm going home.\" I politely replied, \"OK, see you.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:13:00] outside Karl Larsdal's house | I watched Karl Larsdal run toward his house. I heard him slam the door shut, making the glass in it tremble. I heard him say, \"Bye.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:14:00] on the road | I looked toward Oskar Magnus's house. I saw the light on in their kitchen. I wondered whether they had already come home or if only their father was there. I realized I couldn't tell by whether a car was parked outside, since they had a garage.\n[1975-09-29 09:15:00] school | While playing football, I felt someone suddenly step hard on my toes—excruciating pain. I'd also seen Asle or Helen defend themselves by fighting back directly. I knew that people often faced rough treatment on the way to class. From what I'd heard, some liked pressing their fists into others' shoulders. I realized that Asle and Helen had already learned how not to be bullied anymore.\n[1975-09-29 09:15:00] on the road | I turned and looked up the slope. I saw Marianne's father toss a tied plastic bag into the trash can. I saw he was wearing a knitted jacket and had an unshaven face. I knew he was a sailor who spent most of the year working away. From what I'd heard, once he returned home, he never left the house. I noticed he always seemed angry, but in truth, I didn't know anything about him.\n[1975-09-29 09:15:10] on the road | I watched him close the door, completely unaware of my presence.\n[1975-09-29 09:16:00] crossroads | I saw a massive yellow truck loaded with stones drive past the crossroads. I felt the ground tremble as the vehicle passed. I saw thick smoke billowing from its front exhaust pipe.\n[1975-09-29 09:17:00] on the road | I heard Henrik Inge tell me this was a special vehicle from the Apollo space program used to transport rockets, moving extremely slowly, like a giant snail. I knew my brother had once shown me a photo of the world's largest heavy-duty truck. As far as I knew, this truck was specifically designed to carry rockets to the launch site.\n[1975-09-29 09:18:00] on the road | I understood that during the initial phase of a rocket launch, it ascended extremely slowly. I knew that when flames and smoke burst out, a thunderous roar could be heard even kilometers away. I recalled countless photos I'd seen in a book about spaceflight. I had expected the rocket to shoot off at incredible speed, but in the actual images, it initially seemed to waver, almost resting in midair.\n[1975-09-29 09:19:00] on the road | I knew the rocket would eventually surge toward the blue sky at an insane speed. A magnificent image flashed through my mind: it shot upward like an arrow or a beam of light, piercing the clouds.\n[1975-09-29 09:20:00] school | I saw the boys from the east wearing clothes that looked like hand-me-downs passed down through several older brothers. I knew the boys from the east dressed differently from us. I was aware that Karl and I were both deeply worried our secret spot might be discovered by them. I thought that as long as we posted a lookout, there probably wouldn't be a serious problem. I kept observing those kids whose clothing was so different from ours.\n[1975-09-29 09:20:00] on the road | I often pictured a scene in my mind: a rocket secretly launching from behind a mountain peak, slowly rising above the forest, and finally the roar of its engines echoing between our houses.\n[1975-09-29 09:20:10] on the road | I silently judged it to be a rather good idea.\n[1975-09-29 09:25:00] home | I jogged back home, walking across the gravel yard. I opened the door and, while taking off my shoes on the mat, saw Dad coming out from the office hallway.\n[1975-09-29 09:25:10] home | I quickly glanced at him. I sensed he didn’t seem particularly angry at the moment.\n[1975-09-29 09:26:00] home | I heard Dad ask, “Where have you been?” I replied, “Playing with Karl Larsdal.”\n[1975-09-29 09:27:00] home | I kept my eyes fixed on the floor. I heard Dad correct me, 'That's not what I'm asking. Where did you go?' I explained, 'We were up at the Rockhaug supermarket, behind it.'\n[1975-09-29 09:28:00] home | I heard him ask, 'Is that so? What were you doing there?' I answered vaguely, 'Nothing special, just playing.'\n[1975-09-29 09:29:00] home | I heard Dad command, 'You go back there again. We need potatoes. Do you think you can go buy some potatoes?' I replied firmly, 'Yes.'\n[1975-09-29 09:30:00] classroom | I heard the school bell ring, and we gathered into lines. I saw the female teacher walk stiffly to the top of the stairs. I marched into the classroom in line, hung my raincoat on the hook, and immediately sat down at my desk. I felt that the classroom was the safest place—only there could I feel that we were a close-knit group.\n[1975-09-29 09:30:00] home | I saw Dad pull his wallet from his back pocket and take out a banknote. I heard Dad say, 'Let me see your pockets.'\n[1975-09-29 09:31:00] home | I stood up and turned my hips toward him. I felt him slide the banknote into my pocket. I heard Dad instruct, 'Put it in your pants pocket and go quickly.' I responded, 'Okay.'\n[1975-09-29 09:32:00] on the path | I saw him return to his office. I put my shoes back on, carefully closed the door, and started running uphill.",

Then came a burst of laughter around me.\n[1975-09-29 09:37:00] classroom | I heard the teacher maintain order by saying, \"Alright, alright, that's enough talking. In this classroom, we don't speak ill of others. At least not behind their backs!\"\n[1975-09-29 09:38:00] classroom | I loudly declared, \"Toya Moen's father got drunk yesterday! My mom had to drive them over to relatives. That's why he's not here today!\"\n[1975-09-29 09:39:00] classroom | I saw the teacher put her finger to her lips and shake her head at me. Then I noticed she wrote something down in her notebook before turning her gaze back to the whole class. I heard the teacher shush me.\n[1975-09-29 09:40:00] classroom | I heard her ask from up front, \"Are there any other absences? None? Then let's begin.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:45:00] classroom | I saw the teacher step forward and sit on the edge of the lectern. I heard her announce that this week we would be learning about farms, and she asked if any of us had ever been to one.\n[1975-09-29 09:45:10] classroom | I raised my arm as high as possible, eager to the point of nearly standing up. I kept shouting, \"Me, me, me! I've been to one!\"\n[1975-09-29 09:46:00] classroom | I realized I wasn't the only one eager to speak. I saw the teacher finally point to Karl Larsdal B., instead of calling my name.\n[1975-09-29 09:46:10] classroom | I heard him answer, \"I rode a horse at Legoland.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:46:20] classroom | I protested, \"That's not even a farm! I've been to real farms many times—my grandparents...\n[1975-09-29 09:47:00] classroom | I lowered my head somewhat dejectedly. I heard the teacher ask sternly, \"Was it your turn to speak, Grete Lundnes?\" I quietly replied, \"No.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:48:00] classroom | I heard the teacher continue, \"That's right, Legoland isn't a farm. And horses belong on farms—that's correct. Winnie?\"\n[1975-09-29 09:48:10] classroom | I turned around curiously to look for Winnie. Before me was a slightly plump girl with light hair, giggling softly. I wondered to myself: Winnie—who is that?\n[1975-09-29 09:49:00] classroom | I heard her say, blushing, \"I live on a farm, but we don't have animals. We grow vegetables. Then my dad sells them at the market in town.\"\n[1975-09-29 09:50:00] classroom | I argued loudly, \"I've been to a farm with animals!\" Then I heard Karin Ingrid and Marivik·Kristian chime in too: \"Me too!\" \"And me!\"\n[1975-09-29 09:51:00] classroom | I heard the teacher stop us, saying, \"Wait until it's your turn to speak—everyone will get a chance.\"\n[1975-09-29 10:00:00] classroom | Seeing that the teacher had finally called on me after five others, I lowered my hand. I began speaking excitedly, \"My grandmother and grandfather have a farm. It's big, with two cows and a calf, and lots of chickens. I often go with them to collect eggs, and in the morning I watch my grandfather milk the cows. He first clears away the manure and gives them some hay. Sometimes the cows even lift their tails and pee or poop.\"\n[1975-09-29 10:01:00] classroom | I sat in my seat, feeling my face grow hot and red. I continued, shocking everyone, \"Once, a cow peed on me!\" I felt waves of laughter crashing over me.\n[1975-09-29 10:02:00] classroom | I looked around and saw my classmates burst into another round of loud laughter. I noticed the teacher remained silent, letting me keep talking, but I could keenly sense she didn't actually believe me.\n[1975-09-29 11:50:00] classroom | I saw the teacher begin reading a story after everyone had spoken. I noticed she completely ignored me when asking questions, only calling me to stay behind after the bell rang.\n[1975-09-29 11:51:00] classroom | I heard her say to me, \"Grete Lundnes, wait here—I'd like to talk to you.\"\n[1975-09-29 11:52:00] classroom | I watched as the other students ran out of the classroom, leaving me standing alone beside the teacher's desk. I saw the teacher sitting on the edge of the desk, staring at me.\n[1975-09-29 11:53:00] classroom | I heard her teach me: \"Just because we know everything about someone else doesn't mean we should go and tell it. For example, what you said about Toya Moen's father. Don't you think Toya Moen would feel sad about that?\"\n[1975-09-29 11:53:10] classroom | I lowered my head and replied: \"He would.\"\n[1975-09-29 11:54:00] classroom | I couldn't help but start crying. I heard her explain: \"This is called personal privacy. You don't know what that is?\" I sobbed and answered: \"No.\"\n[1975-09-29 11:55:00] classroom | I heard her continue explaining: \"Privacy means everything that happens inside a home. If someone sees what happens in another person's house and then spreads it around, that's never quite right. Do you understand?\"\n[1975-09-29 11:55:10] classroom | I silently nodded my head.\n[1975-09-29 11:56:00] classroom | I heard her comfort me: \"There, there, Grete Lundnes. Don't be upset. You didn't know. Now you do! That's all. Go on now, go outside.\"\n[1975-09-29 12:00:00] schoolyard | I quickly ran out through the corridor and into the schoolyard. I stopped and swept my eyes across every group gathered there. Before me lay the lively schoolyard; I saw girls jumping rope, playing elastic games, and chasing each other playfully.\n[1975-09-29 12:05:00] school football field | I looked down at the football field and saw a group gathered near the goalposts playing ball. I noticed the center of the field was almost entirely filled with murky yellow puddles of mud.\n[1975-09-29 12:10:00] schoolyard | I headed toward Karl Larsdal, Karlsen, and Kristine Lof by the bench. I noticed they were huddled together playing cards.\n[1975-09-29 12:11:00] school playground | I shook my head at them. I heard Kristine Lof ask, \"You've been crying, haven't you?\" I brushed it off: \"No, it was the wind.\" Then I asked what the teacher had said and suggested I could join their card game too.\n[1975-09-29 12:11:10] school playground | I heard Kristine Lof repeat firmly: \"You *have* been crying.\"\n[1975-09-29 12:15:00] school | I knew that Karin, Kristine, and I were the top students in class. I understood that Kristine was strongest in math, while I excelled in reading and writing. As far as I knew, I ranked 7th in physical ability and 4th in football. I clearly remembered being nearly last in throwing the small ball—only Vemund was behind me. I mentally weighed everyone's strengths and weaknesses, musing that although I was tall and good at drawing, I truly wasn't as strong as most others.\n[1975-09-29 12:20:00] school playground | I insisted, \"Sand blew into my eye when I walked down the stairs—that's all. I didn't cry. Can I have a card, please?\"\n[1975-09-29 12:25:00] school playground | I reached out and drew the first card. I saw it was the French S/S—a real ocean liner. I thought with quiet delight: this is the largest passenger ship in the world; I knew this card would beat everyone else's.\n[1975-09-29 13:00:00] classroom | I carefully wrote the letters over and over in my notebook. I knew today’s lesson focused on the 'u' in 'cow,' the 'a' in 'sheep,' and the 'å' in 'goose.' I learned that the homework was to copy these letters in our notebooks.\n[1975-09-29 13:30:00] classroom | I heard the teacher ask if anyone lived near the homes of the classmates who were absent today.\n[1975-09-29 14:00:00] indoor gym | I ran lap after lap around the indoor gym. It suddenly occurred to me—I could use this chance to go to Ingeborg Lofnes’s house and tell her the homework!\n[1975-09-29 14:05:00] indoor gym | At the thought of going to see her, I felt warmth spreading through my whole body, a mix of joy and nervousness stirring in my chest.",

    "text": "[1975-09-29 14:50:00] school / meeting point | I quickly dressed and rushed out of the changing room. I headed toward the meeting point and told Karl Larsdal about my plan along the way. I heard Karl wrinkle his nose and question why we should go out of our way to visit girls whose homes we'd never been to. I shot back: \"You don't understand anything—the whole point is that we go ourselves!\" I was solely focused on seeing Ingeborg, completely dismissing Karl's concerns.\n[1975-09-29 15:00:00] meeting point | I kept pleading with Karl. I noticed that in the end, he finally nodded and agreed to come with me. I saw that he held his ground at first, but eventually gave in to my persuasion.\n[1975-09-29 15:15:00] bus / on the road | I stood on the sidewalk, watching the bus struggle up the hill. I noticed its exhaust fumes spreading across the asphalt. Before me was the sight of a large bus slowly winding through narrow streets, almost like a passenger vessel on a canal. The sound of its labored engine filled my ears. It felt a bit strange to me that the bus would drive directly into the residential area to drop us off.\n[1975-09-29 15:20:00] driveway | I stepped onto my own driveway. I looked around and made sure no one was there. I asked Karl, 'Should I go up, or will you come down?' When he told me to go up, I cheerfully replied, 'OK.' I felt that this quiet environment came naturally to me.\n[1975-09-29 15:21:00] front door | I walked up to my front door. I looked down at the shovel leaning against the wall, noticing droplets of water trembling on its handle. Before me was a damp scene. I saw the dark brown walls of the house streaked with black water stains, and puddles filling the uneven bricks in front of the door. Though the rain had stopped, the air remained heavy with moisture.\n[1975-09-29 15:22:00] front door | I unzipped my coat and pulled out the key, trying to turn it. But I found that once inserted into the lock, it was completely stuck—immovable. I had hoped today might be the day it finally worked, but once again, I was disappointed.\n[1975-09-29 15:23:00] by the yard fence | I glanced warily around to make sure no one was watching. I went to the trash can by the yard fence, took out the half-filled black garbage bag and placed it on the ground, then lifted the trash can high.\n[1975-09-29 15:25:00] beside the house | I struggled to carry the trash can toward the house, setting it down several times along the way because it was so heavy. All the while, I kept my eyes fixed on the sloping road. I felt it was much heavier than I had imagined. I was relieved that no one was in sight.\n[1975-09-29 15:26:00] on the lawn / under the window | I watched as an unfamiliar car drove past. I quickly moved the trash can beneath the window, climbed up, then pulled the glass window open and thrust my head and upper body inside.\n[1975-09-29 15:27:00] basement window | I stared into the empty room, feeling a panicked sense of losing control. I felt the room I was in was dim and warm. Fear and unease filled my mind—I worried someone might be watching me break in through the window at that very moment.\n[1975-09-29 15:28:00] basement window | I twisted my body forward until half of me was inside the window, then grabbed the metal pipe of the heater and pulled myself through for the final stretch.\n[1975-09-29 15:29:00] hall / front door | My foot landed on the floor. I took off my boots, carried them across the entire hall to the front door, opened it, and stepped back outside.\n[1975-09-29 15:30:00] in front of the house | I looked down toward the road below; there were no cars, no movement at all. I thought that as long as Dad didn't suddenly return in the next few minutes—whether because he'd forgotten something or fallen ill—even though he never got sick—as long as nothing unexpected happened, everything would be fine. I felt a hollow emptiness inside, filled with fear and tension.\n[1975-09-29 15:32:00] in front of the house / beside the window | I let out a groan of relief, hurried over to the trash can in three quick steps, moved it back into place, stuffed the garbage bag inside, smoothed the opening, then ran back to the window. I silently rejoiced—if only he didn't appear during these few minutes, I’d succeed.\n[1975-09-29 15:33:00] grass beneath the window | I reached out and tried to smooth the grass to cover the marks left by the trash can, and I turned over some of the soil mixed with fertilizer. To my horror, I noticed the trash can had left visible traces on the grass—some imprints looked quite deep.\n[1975-09-29 15:34:00] grass beneath the window | I straightened up and carefully examined the patch of grass I had just worked on. I wanted to see how it looked, but I could still clearly spot the flaws.\n[1975-09-29 15:34:10] grass beneath the window | I thought that if someone didn’t know what had happened, they might not notice it easily. But then I realized that with Dad’s sharp eyes—eyes that never missed a single detail—he would likely spot it.\n[1975-09-29 15:35:00] grass beneath the window | I crouched down again and kept working at the grass, trying to flatten the marks. When I was done, I stood up. I figured it should be good enough now.\n[1975-09-29 15:36:00] grass beneath the window | I decided that if he noticed, I would simply deny it. I thought he couldn’t possibly imagine me moving the trash can and climbing through the window. I told myself that as long as I kept a straight face, he wouldn’t press further.\n[1975-09-29 15:38:00] room | I wiped my damp, dirty hands on my thighs, slung my backpack over my shoulder, and ran upstairs into my room.\n[1975-09-29 15:40:00] room | I opened the wardrobe and looked at the white shirt. I had wanted to change into it, but in the end, I held myself back. I thought about how Ingeborg would find the shirt beautiful, but I was afraid Dad would question me if he noticed I’d changed clothes. I realized that once he became suspicious, I might very well be caught.\n[1975-09-29 15:42:00] room / outside the window | I locked the door inside the room and climbed up onto the water heater pipes. I turned my body around with my feet facing outward, carefully lowered myself until I let go, and landed on the ground with a splash.\n[1975-09-29 15:45:00] driveway | I quickened my pace onto the driveway, pretending to be nonchalant. I looked around and didn't see any vehicles.\n[1975-09-29 15:46:00] intersection | I saw Fosson, Karlsen, Viktor, and Larssen standing at the intersection. I noticed they spotted me and started riding their bikes toward me. I stood quietly there, waiting for them to come closer.\n[1975-09-29 15:47:00] intersection | I saw Karlsen hit the brakes in front of me. I heard Karlsen ask me, 'Did you hear about it?' I asked back, 'What?'\n[1975-09-29 15:48:00] intersection | I heard Karlsen say nervously, 'Early this morning, a worker at Viddholmen was cut in half by a steel cable.'\n[1975-09-29 15:49:00] intersection | I heard Fosson add, 'The cable snapped while it was being tightened—hit the guy with the flying end and sliced him clean in two. My dad said they sent everyone home today.' Hearing this horrifying news, I couldn't help but feel a chill run through me.\n[1975-09-29 15:50:00] intersection | A terrifying image flashed in my mind: a man cut in half at the waist, his upper body still standing upright beside his lower half. The image made my skin crawl.\n[1975-09-29 15:51:00] intersection | I saw Viktor Lunddal looking at me with concern. I heard Viktor ask me, 'Your bike with the flat tire still not fixed?' I nodded. Then he generously said, 'You can ride with me.'\n[1975-09-29 15:52:00] intersection | I told them, 'I'm going up to Karl Larsdal's place.' I heard Karlsen shrug and say he might go down to the boat, then Viktor asked again where we were headed.\n[1975-09-29 15:53:00] intersection | I explained, 'Up to a classmate’s place—to talk about homework.' I heard Karlsen ask who it was, and I replied, 'Vimund.'\n[1975-09-29 15:54:00] crossroads | I waved and said, \"No, just today. I have to go now.\" I heard Viktor ask, \"Were you with him?\"",

    "text": "[1975-09-29 15:55:00] Karl Larsdal's uphill path | I ran up the slope shouting Karl's name, then saw him come running out holding a slice of bread. I shouted toward his house.\n[1975-09-29 16:15:00] path leading to the highest point | Twenty minutes later, we passed the supermarket again, went around a patch of grass, and began climbing toward the highest part of the housing area. I noticed that from there, it led directly to the homes of Ingeborg, Lilund, and Vemd.\n[1975-09-29 16:16:00] Rocky | As far as I knew, this path formed a loop, connecting all the side roads and houses in the housing area. I knew the main road outside also formed a circular roundabout. I thought to myself, marveling, that we actually lived in a circle inside a circle inside a circle.\n[1975-09-29 16:20:00] beside the cliff | I saw that the two road surfaces outside the supermarket ran parallel, but were separated by a small cliff about ten meters high. A green wire-mesh fence stood on the cliff face, with an artificial sloped hill above it.\n[1975-09-29 16:21:00] at the fence | Karl and I climbed down along the fence. Though I couldn't see the road, I could clearly hear the roar of cars rushing beneath my feet. The sound gave me a strange thrill.\n[1975-09-29 16:22:00] at the fence | When cars came up from the direction of the gas station, I first heard a faint whooshing sound, which grew louder and louder until it echoed against the cliff wall and rushed past at high speed.\n[1975-09-29 16:23:00] at the fence | Karl and I each held a stone, crouching beside the fence. We planned to throw stones at the cars. Since we couldn't see them, we had to focus completely and time our throws by sound alone.\n[1975-09-29 16:24:00] at the fence | I saw that the stone was larger than my hand, heavy and solid. I looked down at the vertical roadway surface about ten meters below.\n[1975-09-29 16:25:00] at the fence | I saw Karl launch the first attack—he threw his stone at the peak of the noise. Then I heard the hollow thud of the stone hitting the asphalt. I saw his stone miss, rolling off to the side.\n[1975-09-29 16:26:00] fence | I quickly followed suit and threw the stone out, watching it hit the road and spark a small shower of sparks. I realized I had thrown too early—the car was probably still about fifty meters away.\n[1975-09-29 16:28:00] sidewalk | I saw a woman carrying two plastic bags walking toward us along the sidewalk. She stopped in her tracks. I noticed this woman was a stranger we’d never seen before.\n[1975-09-29 16:28:10] sidewalk | I heard the woman ask, “What are you doing down there?” Carl replied, “Nothing special.” She warned us again, “You’d better come up here—this place is steep and dangerous.”\n[1975-09-29 16:30:00] sidewalk | I saw her watching us as she continued walking. Carl and I decided to follow her advice and climbed up to higher ground. I felt her eyes lingering on us, making me slightly uneasy.\n[1975-09-29 16:35:00] outside Vemund's house | I walked along the narrow strip of stones by the roadside and saw Vemund’s little sister kneeling in the sandbox. I saw her wearing a yellow raincoat, busy with a green shovel inside a blue plastic bucket.\n[1975-09-29 16:36:00] outside Vemund's house | I heard Carl ask, “Shall we go to Vemund’s first?” I immediately refused, “No, not yet—we’ll start at Ingeborg Lofnes’s house.”\n[1975-09-29 16:36:10] outside Vemund's house | Ingeborg’s name seemed to carry an electric charge. Every time I whispered it softly, I could feel a warm current spreading through my body.\n[1975-09-29 16:37:00] outside Vemund's house | I heard Carl mutter, “What’s wrong?” I shot back, “What?” He remarked, “You’re acting strange.” I quickly defended myself, “Strange? No, not at all—I’m exactly the same as always, me.”\n[1975-09-29 17:00:00] home | Before dinner, I saw my brother return just in time. Then I heard Dad shouting from the kitchen that dinner was ready.\n[1975-09-29 17:10:00] kitchen | I sat down at the table and saw Dad bring out grilled steaks and potatoes. Freshly cooked steak, fried onions, and boiled cauliflower came into view.\n[1975-09-29 17:15:00] kitchen | I heard Mom say, \"A housecleaner is coming to our house, Mrs. Jæren.\" She also said she had already called her at work. As far as I know, Mrs. Jæren is an elderly woman who is scheduled to come to our house once a week, and she was supposed to arrive that afternoon. I heard Mom comment that she sounded like a nice person.\n[1975-09-29 17:20:00] at home | I clearly remember that Dad used to be firmly against hiring a cleaner. I noticed that Dad wasn’t saying anything now, and I realized he must have changed his mind. Though he might still be reluctant, this silent acceptance surprised me.\n[1975-09-29 17:25:00] at home | I was happy that we were getting a housecleaner. I thought to myself how pleasant it always is when someone visits, and I imagined her arrival would bring a certain freshness to the house. I also looked forward to them noticing me, asking about school or soccer.\n[1975-09-29 18:00:00] Henrik Inge's room | After dinner, I slipped into my brother’s room. I saw him take an album titled 'Pile Driver' from the tape shelf and put it into the player. The sound of Status Quo’s rock music filled my ears.\n[1975-09-29 18:05:00] Henrik Inge's room | I said to my brother, \"I saw you on a bus somewhere—where did you go?\" I heard him reply briefly, \"Into town.\"\n[1975-09-29 18:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw him lie down on the bed and start flipping through a magazine. I pressed on, \"So, what did you go there for?\" I heard him say somewhat impatiently, \"Stop nagging me—I went to buy some bike parts.\"\n[1975-09-29 18:11:00] Henrik Inge's room | I stared at him. I saw him turn his head and look at me seriously. I asked, \"Is the bike broken?\" I saw him shake his head, then I heard him say, \"Don’t tell anyone. Not even Mom.\" I promised him, \"I swear I won’t tell.\"\n[1975-09-29 18:12:00] Henrik Inge's room | I heard my brother explain, \"The bike’s at Frank’s place—the frame broke. But his dad says he can fix it, and I can pick it up tomorrow morning.\"\n[1975-09-29 18:15:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw my brother shrug again and go back to reading. I said to my brother, \"Just think—if Dad or someone he knows had seen you in town?\"\n[1975-09-29 18:30:00] hallway at home | I returned to my own room. A little later, I heard someone ringing the doorbell. I waited until I noticed Mom going downstairs to the hallway before stepping out of my room.\n[1975-09-29 18:31:00] stairs | I saw the large, elderly woman walking up the stairs. I noticed her hair was gray, she wore a pair of glasses, and her whole figure looked somewhat round.\n[1975-09-29 18:32:00] stairs | I nodded at her and saw her smile back at me. I heard Mom introduce her: 'This is Grete Lundnes, the younger one.'\n[1975-09-29 18:33:00] stairs | I felt her hand rest on my shoulder. I heard her say to me: 'I'm Mrs. Yhlen—we're going to be good friends.' I felt warmth spreading through my entire body.\n[1975-09-29 18:34:00] stairs | I heard Mom say: 'The older one, Henrik Inge, is in his room.' I asked her, 'Shall I go call him?' Then I heard Mom shaking her head and telling me: 'You don't need to.'\n[1975-09-29 18:40:00] bedroom | I saw Mom showing her around the house, then I returned to my own room.\n[1975-09-29 19:00:00] bedroom | I saw the sky outside grow dark. I heard raindrops pattering against the roof and walls, heard the water trickling through the gutters. I saw large droplets strike the windowpane and run down in unpredictable, winding paths.\n[1975-09-29 19:10:00] bedroom | I saw the headlights of a car sweeping across the spruce tree above the mailbox stand. I realized it was Jacobson coming home from work. I saw the green mailbox and the metal post supporting it gleam under the light. I felt as though those mailboxes were silently pleading in the stillness: No, no, don’t bring light.\n[1975-09-29 19:20:00] bedroom | I lay down on my bed. I was thinking about Ingeborg Lofnes. I thought about how tomorrow we would go there again, but more than anything, I longed to see her at school first. I felt that just seeing her would be enough—the joy would spread through every cell in my body.\n[1975-09-29 19:30:00] bedroom | I was thinking that one day I would ask her if we could be together. I wanted to go to her room, and I wanted her to come to mine. Even though I wasn’t allowed to invite people over, I thought that for her, I’d find a way—maybe even climb in through the window if I had to.\n[1975-09-29 19:40:00] bedroom | I sat down at my desk, pulled out my books from my backpack, and began doing my homework.\n[1975-09-29 20:00:00] at home | I noticed Mrs. Yellen had left, and then I heard Henrik Inge's footsteps disappear into the kitchen.\n[1975-09-29 20:05:00] kitchen | I knew it was Monday today, and every Monday evening my brother would make pancakes or muffins in the kitchen.\n[1975-09-29 20:10:00] kitchen | I felt the warmth in the kitchen, and I smelled the pleasant aroma of pancakes or muffins. I understood that when my brother was busy, I would usually sit there chatting with Mom.\n[1975-09-29 20:15:00] kitchen | I learned that once my brother finished cooking, we would spread butter on the food, watch it melt, and eat it with cheese, sugar, tea, and milk.\n[1975-09-29 20:20:00] kitchen | I realized that sometimes Dad would appear there too, but as far as I knew, he usually returned to his office quickly.\n[1975-09-29 20:30:00] kitchen | I noticed homework didn't take long; after finishing my letters, I headed toward the kitchen.\n[1975-09-29 20:35:00] kitchen | I saw Henrik Inge standing there with his sleeves rolled up and an apron on, watching him stir a bowl with a wooden spoon. I saw the light on inside the empty oven.\n[1975-09-29 20:40:00] kitchen | I saw Mom tug at the yarn ball, a motion that made me feel as if she were sitting on a boat fishing. I sat down in my seat and asked Mom, \"You'll be finishing soon, right?\" I heard her reply, \"Another day or two, depending on how fast I knit.\"\n[1975-09-29 20:45:00] kitchen | I told Mom, \"Today Karl and I went up to Ingeborg and Lilund's place.\" I heard her ask back, \"Oh really? Who are they? From your class?\" I nodded at her.\n[1975-09-29 20:46:00] kitchen | I heard Henrik Inge tease, \"So now you're starting to play with girls?\" I replied, \"Yeah?\" Then I heard him ask, \"Who've you fallen in love with, huh?\"\n[1975-09-29 20:47:00] kitchen | I looked at Mom hesitantly, then turned back to Henrik Inge. I admitted to him, 'I think so.'\n[1975-09-29 20:48:00] kitchen | I saw Henrik Inge start laughing. I heard him mock me, 'You're only seven! You don't know what it means to fall in love!'\n[1975-09-29 20:49:00] kitchen | I heard Mom say seriously to my brother, 'You shouldn't laugh at someone for something like this, Henrik Inge.'\n[1975-09-29 20:50:00] kitchen | I saw Henrik Inge blush and suddenly bury his head in his bowl. I heard Mom continue, 'Feelings are feelings, whether you're seven or seventy. They’re equally important, do you understand?'\n[1975-09-29 20:51:00] kitchen | The kitchen fell silent for a moment, then I heard Henrik Inge say, 'But it can’t possibly lead to anything!'\n[1975-09-29 20:52:00] kitchen | I heard Mom say, 'Perhaps you're right about that, but can't a person still have feelings for someone else?' I retorted to my brother, 'You’re in love with Anne!' I heard him quickly deny it, but I insisted, 'You said you were in love with her.'\n[1975-09-29 20:53:00] kitchen | I heard Mom intervene, 'Alright, alright, how’s the batter coming along? Is it ready?' I heard my brother reply, 'I think so.'\n[1975-09-29 20:55:00] kitchen | I saw Mom put the fabric she was holding into the basket and stand up. I heard her ask, 'Let me see?' Then she asked me, 'Would you like to grease the baking pan, Grete Lundnes?'\n[1975-09-29 20:56:00] kitchen | I saw Mom take out a small jar of melted butter, hand me a brush, and pull the baking pan from the bottom drawer of the stove.\n[1975-09-29 20:57:00] kitchen | I observed the heated butter, noticing many small pits and some larger light brown spots within its thin yellow layer. I realized that if you heat the oil slowly, its color becomes richer and purer.\n[1975-09-29 20:58:00] kitchen | I dipped the brush into the oil and spread it across the baking tray. I tried pulling the brush along rather than pushing it forward. I felt the melted oil making the brush stiff and resistant. I noticed the melted brown oil forming a thin layer on the baking tray.\n[1975-09-29 20:59:00] kitchen | I finished greasing in just ten seconds. Then I sat back down, watching Henrik Inge begin shaping the pancakes.\n[1975-09-29 21:00:00] kitchen | I immediately sat up straight in my chair. I heard the door downstairs creak open, followed by Dad’s heavy footsteps climbing the stairs.\n[1975-09-29 21:01:00] kitchen | I saw Mom sit down again, placing the fabric on her lap and looking toward the doorway. That was when I saw Dad appear there.\n[1975-09-29 21:02:00] kitchen | I saw Dad hook his thumbs into his belt loops and hoist his trousers upward. I heard Dad say, 'The whole family's here, I suppose dinner will be ready soon?' I heard Mom reply, 'Another fifteen minutes.'\n[1975-09-29 21:03:00] kitchen | I noticed Henrik Inge simply lower his head slightly in response. I heard Dad ask, 'You're making pancakes, Henrik Inge?' Then I heard him murmur, 'Good, good.'\n[1975-09-29 21:05:00] living room | I saw Dad turn and walk into the living room. He stopped in front of the television, turned on the switch, and sat down in the brown leather armchair. I heard the floorboards creak under his weight.\n[1975-09-29 21:10:00] living room | I recognized the voice from the TV—the doctor from that medical show, his voice raspy like rusted metal. I noticed the man on screen always tilted his head back to speak toward the ceiling, yet his eyes remained fixed downward. It seemed to me as if he were directing the sound to land in exactly the right place.\n[1975-09-29 21:15:00] living room | I stood up and walked into the living room.\n[1975-09-29 21:20:00] living room | I asked Dad, 'Are they performing surgery?' I heard him answer, 'What else did you expect?' I pressed, 'Can I watch?' He agreed, 'Sure, it's not dangerous or anything.' I saw the TV screen showing incised skin, blue sheets filled with blood and flesh.\n[1975-09-29 21:25:00] living room | I sat on the outermost edge of the sofa. I saw straight into the inside of a human body, the surgical site held open by metal clamps like a funnel. I noticed the freshly cut piece of flesh, its base a glistening membranous organ, smeared with dark blood—all clearly visible under the harsh glare of fluorescent lights.\n[1975-09-29 21:30:00] living room | I saw a pair of hands wearing rubber gloves skillfully manipulating instruments. As the image zoomed in, I saw a person lying flat, covered entirely with blue plastic sheeting. I noticed five medical staff in green surgical gowns—two bent over beneath a lizard-shaped light, the other three holding trays filled with instruments.\n[1975-09-29 21:35:00] living room | I saw Dad stand up. I heard him complain, \"I'm not watching this anymore, this is unbearable—on Monday nights they only show this kind of thing!\" I asked, \"Can I keep watching?\" He replied, \"Sure, you can handle it.\"\n[1975-09-29 21:40:00] living room | I saw one end of the membrane pulsating, expanding and contracting rhythmically. I noticed fresh blood welling up, while the membrane kept dilating to push the blood aside, then reemerging again from the pool of blood.",

    "text": "[1975-09-29 21:41:00] living room | Suddenly I realized what I was seeing was a heart, and a terrible sadness welled up inside me.\n[1975-09-29 21:42:00] living room | I thought to myself that the sorrow wasn't because the heart couldn't escape. I realized the heart should beat secretly, hidden from sight. It was like a blind little creature meant to throb and pulse beneath the chest, unseen.\n[1975-09-29 21:45:00] living room | I continued staring at the screen. I felt that surgery programs were my favorite. I recalled how long ago I had already decided that when I grew up, I would become a surgeon.\n[1975-09-29 21:50:00] living room | I knew my parents sometimes told others about this as a joke, because I was so young at the time. But deep down, I knew I was serious. I wanted to grow up and cut open wounds, to operate inside the human body.\n[1975-09-29 21:55:00] living room | I remembered how I had always drawn pictures filled with bloodstains, knives, and surgical scenes. I realized Mom had often asked me, puzzled, why I insisted on drawing such gory images. I thought I could draw houses and suns if I wanted to, but that wasn’t what I truly desired. In my heart, I sighed—divers, rockets, and surgeries were the things I really wanted to draw.\n[1975-09-29 21:56:00] Bærum | I knew Henrik Inge once wanted to be a janitor when he was a child. As far as I knew, Grandma would always bring it up and laugh, mentioning how Dad had wanted to be a handyman—she’d repeated these old stories hundreds of times.\n[1975-09-29 21:57:00] living room | I realized my ambition to become a surgeon was serious, completely different from my brother’s childhood joke about wanting to be a janitor. I realized I was already much older than he was back then, and this fact was anything but funny to me.\n[1975-09-29 22:00:00] living room | I heard the program host describing the surgery that had just been completed. I saw all the metal clamps and tubes being removed from the open wound.\n[1975-09-29 22:10:00] kitchen | I stood up and walked into the kitchen, seeing the freshly baked pancakes sitting on a tray. I noticed Mom placing dinner plates and teacups on the dining table. I saw the tray cooling on the electric stove. I noticed the teakettle beside it steaming gently.\n[1975-09-30 07:00:00] home | I saw Mom pull out a thick pair of socks and told me to put them on before slipping into my rubber boots. I felt the temperature drop, though the rain had stopped. I noticed last year’s mid-calf boots had shrunk and no longer fit.\n[1975-09-30 07:10:00] home | I put on the blue down jacket I’d bought last winter and pulled the matching blue hat down over my forehead. I felt the hat block my vision, like a black awning.\n[1975-09-30 08:00:00] school | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes wearing a smooth, shiny light-blue down jacket with a white hat, white scarf, and blue pants. I noticed she had on brand-new red half-boots, and her black hair curled out from under the brim of her hat.\n[1975-09-30 08:05:00] school | I looked over toward the girls and saw Ingeborg standing among them. I noticed she didn’t see me.\n[1975-09-30 08:05:10] school | I silently marveled at how strikingly beautiful the color of her down jacket was. I thought I wished I could have one just like it.\n[1975-09-30 08:10:00] school gathering spot | I suggested to Karl Larsdal that we go together to snatch their hats—him taking Lilund’s, and me taking Ingeborg’s. I saw we had arrived at the school gathering spot, where everyone piled their backpacks together.\n[1975-09-30 08:11:00] schoolyard | I lunged from behind Ingeborg, yanking off her hat, then turned and ran. I saw her spin around the moment I grabbed the hat, and I heard her let out a sharp scream. I waited until I was sure our eyes had met before I started running.\n[1975-09-30 08:12:00] school playground | I ran across the playground, glancing back from time to time to see if she was chasing after me. I controlled my running speed—I wanted to make sure I wasn't too fast for her to catch up, but not so slow that others would notice I was deliberately waiting for her.\n[1975-09-30 08:13:00] school playground | I felt her spread her arms and wrap them around me from behind. I heard her footsteps closely following mine on the asphalt path.\n[1975-09-30 08:15:00] school playground | I held the hat high above her head. Finally, I gave it back to her and quietly watched as she put it on and walked away. I heard her laugh and call out to me: \"Give it to me, give it to me!\" I silently cheered inside—how wonderful that thick down jacket felt pressed together. My heart swelled with immense joy.\n[1975-09-30 08:16:00] school playground | I saw her turn around and flash me a radiant smile. I gazed into her eyes, marveling inwardly: Ah, her eyes—so dark, so beautiful, still sparkling!\n[1975-09-30 08:17:00] school playground | I felt as though I had entered a brilliantly shining realm. I thought: compared to this, everything else seemed dim and utterly meaningless.\n[1975-09-30 08:30:00] classroom | I heard the bell ring, then lined up and walked into the classroom, taking my seat. I heard the class bell echoing through the schoolyard.\n[1975-09-30 14:00:00] School / Bus / On the way | I sat in the classroom listening to lessons, speaking up, drawing, and playing football during breaks. I sang songs beside Karl on the bus ride home. Though I did everything I normally did, I felt a new sky rising within me. I realized that because of her, even the most familiar daily details had become completely renewed.\n[1975-09-30 15:00:00] outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes standing outside by the driveway, among a group of children.\n[1975-09-30 15:05:00] outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw two girls swinging a long rope while the others took turns darting in to jump. I heard the mechanical whipping sound of the rope hitting the ground.\n[1975-09-30 15:10:00] outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Ingeborg smiling at us. I heard her say to us: \"You come too!\"\n[1975-09-30 15:15:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I joined the line and jumped into the rope, but after just a couple of jumps, the rope whipped against my leg. I had to exit the game disheartened. I really wanted to perform well in front of Ingeborg, hoping to win her favor. But I found myself eliminated far too quickly.\n[1975-09-30 15:20:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Karl Larsdal jumping quite well, managing five jumps before being swung out. I watched him dash forward rapidly a few steps, using momentum to steady himself. I noticed how his wildly flailing arms and legs actually coordinated so well. His final sprinting motion seemed just like that of a professional runner.\n[1975-09-30 15:20:10] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I secretly worried whether Ingeborg now thought Karl was better than me.\n[1975-09-30 15:21:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Ingeborg step lightly into the rope and begin dancing gracefully, swiftly shifting her center of gravity between her feet, her eyes calmly fixed ahead. After she jumped out, she glanced at me. I saw her smile so brightly—I felt her smile was saying to me, 'Now you see!'\n[1975-09-30 15:22:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Karl Larsdal try again but fail, and now he was staggering slowly toward me. I noticed he kept nodding in rhythm with the rope. I thought his last jump had truly been an earnest effort.\n[1975-09-30 15:25:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw the pooled water in the large pit of the backfill area appeared a murky yellow. I also noticed that in the smaller puddles, the water was a gray-green close to the color of gravel, shimmering with light.\n[1975-09-30 15:30:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I stood at the edge of the slope and looked down. I heard the gentle babbling of a stream coming from the woods below. A monotonous machine hum echoed in my ears. I realized I had never been to that place down there before.\n[1975-09-30 15:35:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw how the foundation of the house near the woods turned into a steep stone cliff. Below lay a patch of withered, yellowish marsh. Between the trunks of pine trees, I spotted a green tool shed and a roaring yellow generator.\n[1975-09-30 15:40:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I heard the sound of drilling—sharp, crisp metallic taps chiseling rock. Though I couldn't see anyone, I realized the sound seemed almost like singing—a sound I was very familiar with.\n[1975-09-30 15:45:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I turned around and saw Karl Larsdal walking toward me.\n[1975-09-30 15:50:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Ingeborg easily jump under the rope, but she soon let it hit her arm and stepped out. She walked toward us with Lilund. I heard Ingeborg say, \"Come with me, Lilund?\" I thought she had deliberately let the rope touch her arm, just so she could stop playing sooner.\n[1975-09-30 15:55:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw both of them come to a stop in front of us. I heard Ingeborg ask, \"What should we do now?\"\n[1975-09-30 16:00:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I suggested, \"Let's go look for empty bottles, okay?\" I heard Karl immediately respond, \"Yeah, find empty bottles!\" Then I heard Ingeborg ask curiously where we might find them.\n[1975-09-30 16:05:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I heard Karl list places like along the roadside, behind the playground, and around the workshop. I added, \"At the bus stop, and under the bridge.\"\n[1975-09-30 16:10:00] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I saw Lilund and Ingeborg looking at Karl with admiration. I heard Karl boast to them, \"Once we found a whole bag full, down in the ditch below the shop. We got four kroner for it!\"\n[1975-09-30 16:10:10] Outside Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I felt a bit resentful inside: finding empty bottles was my idea, I came up with it first, yet Karl was taking all the credit.",

    "text": "[1975-09-30 16:15:00] On the path | We started walking downhill. I saw everyone moving forward along the roadside. Before me stretched a gray sky, dry and hard like dried cement. I noticed there was no wind, the treetops were motionless, the trees standing like silent, thoughtful sentinels.\n[1975-09-30 16:20:00] On the path | I saw the pines pointing upward into the sky, as if resting. I noticed the spruce branches drawn inward, appearing heavy and solemn. The old oak by the roadside gave off an air of accustomed loneliness. I sensed that the slender deciduous trees seemed timid and sensitive. I silently marveled—these trees appeared to be showing themselves to me in different postures.\n[1975-09-30 16:25:00] On the path | I heard Ingeborg Lofnes point to the slope and say, \"There's a pipe running all along this road.\" I saw the pipe covered with freshly turned black soil, with no wildflowers yet growing on it.\n[1975-09-30 16:30:00] Beside the pipe | We walked down toward it. I looked at the concrete pipe. I asked, \"Has anyone here ever crawled through a pipe?\" When they shook their heads, I suggested, \"Let's crawl through it.\" I heard Karl immediately agree, \"Yeah, let's crawl through it.\" I estimated the pipe's diameter to be just over half a meter.\n[1975-09-30 16:35:00] beside the pipe | I saw Karl standing on a stool, peering into the pipe, then he began to crawl in with his upper body. I looked at Ingeborg and Lilund. I heard Lilund ask anxiously, 'What if we get stuck inside?' I reassured them, 'We can crawl through. You two go wait for us at the other end.' When Ingeborg asked if we dared, Karl turned back and asked me who should go first. I told him to go ahead.\n[1975-09-30 16:40:00] inside the pipe | I watched Karl twist his body until he completely disappeared into the darkness of the pipe. I heard Karl call out, 'OK.' I noticed the pipe was so narrow that crawling on all fours was impossible. I realized we could only move forward by wriggling.\n[1975-09-30 16:45:00] inside the pipe | I bent down like Karl did and pushed my head into the pipe. I used my elbows against the walls to inch forward. I smelled a thick, suffocating odor of cold dampness and mold filling my nostrils. I glanced at Ingeborg beside me, then plunged my head into that moist, musty air.\n[1975-09-30 16:50:00] inside the pipe | I struggled to straighten my body slightly, using my forearms and knees to push against the walls as I twisted forward in the dark. I stared ahead, catching sight of Karl’s increasingly blurred silhouette. I felt my entire body enclosed by the cold concrete walls. At first, I could still see Karl’s shadow ahead, but as we went deeper, everything turned pitch black.\n[1975-09-30 16:51:00] inside the pipe | I shouted loudly, 'Are you there?' I heard him answer, 'Yes.' Then I asked if he was afraid, and he admitted, 'A little.' I told him I felt the same way.\n[1975-09-30 16:52:00] inside the pipe | I felt the entire pipe suddenly vibrate. I realized a heavy vehicle had driven past above us on the road. A terrifying thought surged through me: if the pipe collapsed, we’d be trapped inside, crushed. The image unsettled me deeply.\n[1975-09-30 16:53:00] inside the pipe | I remained frozen in place, unable to move, feeling my fingers and toes tremble violently. A wave of panic hit me hard. Though I knew I had to move to get out, I found myself paralyzed. Desperately, I screamed inwardly: I can't make myself move.\n[1975-09-30 16:54:00] inside the pipe | I heard my own voice trembling as I asked, 'Are you still scared?' I heard Karl reply that he was, just a little. Then I felt another slight vibration ripple through the pipe. I heard another car pass overhead.\n[1975-09-30 16:55:00] inside the pipe | I remained frozen, not daring to move. I could feel the legs of my pants soaked by stagnant water inside the pipe. I heard Karl shout from ahead, 'I see light!'\n[1975-09-30 16:56:00] inside the pipe | I imagined immense weight pressing down on the pipe, knowing it was only a few centimeters of concrete holding it up. My heart pounded wildly. A frantic urge to stand up surged through me, but I knew it was impossible in the narrow space. I felt my body tightly gripped, weighed down.\n[1975-09-30 16:57:00] inside the pipe | I recalled how my brother Henrik Inge would sometimes ride on top of me, pressing the blanket tightly over me and pinning down my arms and legs. I knew he hated it when I struggled, so I did it deliberately. I remembered the terror of being trapped. I realized that whenever that suffocating sensation came over me, I would scream wildly out of sheer, inescapable fear.\n[1975-09-30 16:58:00] inside the pipe | I shouted desperately, “Karl Larsdal!” I realized that familiar panic of being restrained was tightening around my heart again. I felt paralyzed, and the fear was growing stronger.\n[1975-09-30 16:59:00] inside the pipe | I heard Karl Larsdal shout ahead, “I’ll help you! I have to crawl out first and then turn back!” Hearing his voice, I felt some of the panic inside me ease slightly.\n[1975-09-30 17:00:00] inside the pipe | I tried moving my forearms forward, laboriously dragging my legs along. I felt the back of my down jacket scraping against the upper wall of the pipe. I thought about the tons of rock and soil pressing down from above, and suddenly I felt my arms and legs go completely limp. I could only lie flat where I was.\n[1975-09-30 17:01:00] inside the pipe | I worried about what Ingeborg Lofnes and Lilund would think of me, and this thought made my panic surge again. I felt sealed in, utterly immobile.\n[1975-09-30 17:02:00] inside the pipe | I noticed movement in the darkness ahead, heard the sound of clothes brushing against the concrete pipe wall. I clearly heard Karl’s distinctive open-mouthed breathing. I saw a pale face faintly emerge from the dark ahead—I realized it was Karl returning.\n[1975-09-30 17:03:00] inside the pipe | I felt Karl grab the sleeve of my jacket and pull me toward him. I heard him ask, “Are you stuck?” I answered, “No.”\n[1975-09-30 17:04:00] inside the pipe | I arched my back and inched forward step by step. I felt Karl constantly tugging at my sleeve as he backed up. Seeing Karl’s focused face, I stopped thinking about the pipe’s darkness and weight. I felt I could finally move again.\n[1975-09-30 17:05:00] pipe exit | I saw Karl Larsdal’s feet emerge from the opening first, then my upper body was pulled out—I finally lifted my head back into the light. I heard Ingeborg Lofnes ask, “You were stuck, weren’t you?” I replied, “Yes, just for a moment. But Karl Larsdal helped me.”\n[1975-09-30 17:06:00] pipe exit | I saw Karl Larsdal stand up and brush off his hands and pants. I stood up too. I heard Karl suggest, “Shall we go down to Little Hawaii?” I responded, “Good idea.” I stood beneath a gray sky, feeling the vast openness of space—everything seemed clear and distinct.\n[1975-09-30 17:10:00] pipe outlet | I ran down the woodland and saw the black lake water before me. I saw everyone jump onto the two small islands covered by trees. I saw the trees on the islands standing quietly, and the surface of Little Hawaii was pitch black. I felt that running through the woods was truly exhilarating.\n[1975-09-30 17:20:00] Little Hawaii | I watched Ingeborg Lofnes, seeing her soft red lips part to reveal white teeth. I noticed her mouth always carried a smile, her eyes sparkling with wonder and joy. I felt that all her movements followed the stirrings of her heart.\n[1975-09-30 17:21:00] Little Hawaii | I watched two girls run toward the mainland. I nodded at them as well. I heard Ingeborg Lofnes suggest, 'You're sailors, just returning home... shall we play this?' Karl Larsdal also nodded in agreement.\n[1975-09-30 17:25:00] Little Hawaii | I watched them walk deeper into the woods for a while. I heard Ingeborg Lofnes shout loudly, 'Now you can come back!'\n[1975-09-30 17:30:00] Little Hawaii | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes impatiently stamping her feet, then sprinting toward me. As soon as she reached me, she stretched out her arms and tightly embraced me. I heard her exclaim, 'How I've missed you! Oh, my dear husband!' Then she asked me to do it again. I felt her face pressed against my cheek, and I felt somewhat flustered inside.\n[1975-09-30 17:35:00] Little Hawaii | I ran back to the island, and after Karl took his position, I rushed toward them again. I felt her stretch out her arms and embrace me once more.\n[1975-09-30 17:36:00] Little Hawaii | I gazed up at the deep, vast sky. I felt my heart pounding intensely. I wasn't only standing in the woods—I felt as though I stood at the base of my inner self, gazing upward at a future filled with light and joy.\n[1975-09-30 17:40:00] Little Hawaii | I felt her body press close to mine. I smelled the apple-like fragrance from her hair. Through my thick down jacket, I could feel her body warmth. I noticed her cool skin pressing against my nearly scorching skin.\n[1975-09-30 17:45:00] Little Hawaii | I saw us repeat this game three times. Then we walked deep into the woods, across a slope covered with fallen leaves. Before me lay a carpet of red, yellow, and brown leaves. I heard the gentle murmur of a stream flowing somewhere nearby.\n[1975-09-30 17:46:00] Little Hawaii | I saw the land winding downward below the slope, the distant hazy bay lying there, while the sky above appeared clear and bright.\n[1975-09-30 18:00:00] wooded path | We walked along the potholed roadside, dodging cars. I noticed that bottles found in the woods were always covered by leaves, possibly stuffed full of tiny insects.\n[1975-09-30 18:05:00] wooded path | I followed my friends across the road, heading toward Old Tibaken. I passed the abandoned shed building belonging to the Larsen family. I knew the owner was a colleague of my father’s at school. As far as I knew, there were many rumors about him showing up drunk to class. I searched around for empty bottles, but found nothing.\n[1975-09-30 18:10:00] by the highway | I entered a construction area. I walked along a path covered with red and yellow autumn leaves. I saw a white wooden cabin hidden deep within an old orchard. The sky was a cold, gray hue. I felt as if I were walking along the bottom of a vast bottle capped by the sky, with the surrounding hills forming its rim.",

    "text": "[1975-09-30 18:20:00] Old Tibaken | I stopped by a mailbox. I saw an elderly woman standing outside the upper house, trying to pull a tree out of the ground. I saw a wide stream flowing from the woods, beside which stood a small house.\n[1975-09-30 18:30:00] Old Tibaken | I saw the old woman straighten up and wave at us, motioning for us to come over. I noticed the large tree had thick, sprawling branches, towering high above her.\n[1975-09-30 18:40:00] Old Tibaken meadow | We ran up the slope, stepping on damp, soft grass, until we reached her. I heard the old woman say, 'You all look strong—can you help me? I want to pull this tree out from here.'\n[1975-09-30 18:41:00] outside the old woman's house | I grabbed one of the branches and watched as we all pulled together. I saw the roots finally loosen from the soil, and we dragged the tree onto the bank. I heard Karl Larsdal leading the chant: 'Heave-ho! Heave-ho!' Hearing her say we were strong made me feel proud and pleased.\n[1975-09-30 18:45:00] outside the old woman's house | I watched the old lady bow her head and walk back into the house. I heard her repeatedly saying thank you, praising how strong we were, and saying she’d bring something to reward us.\n[1975-09-30 18:50:00] outside the old woman's house | I asked curiously, 'What do you think we’ll get?' I heard Karl guess cookies, Ingeborg guessed bread, and Lilund guessed apples. I remembered the apple trees growing along the roadside and thought Lilund’s guess made sense.\n[1975-09-30 18:55:00] outside the old woman's house | I watched her step out again. I saw that she wasn’t holding any food in her hands. I heard her say, 'This is just a small token of my gratitude. Who would like to take it? It’s for all of you.' I saw her hold out a five-krone coin. I was somewhat surprised that she offered money instead.\n[1975-09-30 19:00:00] outside the old woman's house | I took the five-kroner coin. I said loudly, \"I can take it, thank you so much!\" I also heard her saying goodbye to us. Getting the five kroner made me feel incredibly excited.\n[1975-09-30 19:05:00] outside the old woman's house | We ran downhill, discussing how to spend the money. Karl and I wanted to buy something delicious. I heard Ingeborg and Lilund say they had to go home because it was time for dinner.\n[1975-09-30 19:10:00] outside the old woman's house | I watched Ingeborg and Lilund walk up the path home. Karl and I continued toward the shop. I could feel the five-kroner coin burning in my pants pocket. Even though we'd said we'd wait until tomorrow, I realized I couldn't possibly do that. I decided to buy now and surprise them tomorrow.\n[1975-09-30 19:15:00] on the road | Right after I bought the candy, I saw Karl Larsdal's father driving by. I heard Karl's father call us to get in the car.\n[1975-09-30 19:20:00] at the shop | I saw Karl get into the car, and then it drove off. I heard Karl's father say they wouldn't take me this time because they were going into town. I heard Karl whisper to me as he left, \"Don't eat it all yourself!\"\n[1975-09-30 19:30:00] outside the shop | I crossed the street, ran down the cliff, dashed across the football field alone, and went through the woods. I stood quietly in place until the car disappeared.\n[1975-09-30 19:31:00] outside the shop | I stopped in front of my house. I divided the candy from the bag into the four pockets of my coat, then threw away the empty bag. I saw the living room light on inside the house.\n[1975-09-30 19:35:00] on the road / in the woods | I saw my father's car and my brother's bicycle parked in the driveway. I noticed my brother's bike handlebars had been fixed. I saw the repaired parts gleaming, and thought to myself this would probably be hard to hide from my father's eyes.\n[1975-09-30 19:45:00] at the front door | I opened the door and went in. I carefully took off my shoes and went upstairs into the bathroom. I planned that if my father asked about my coat, I’d say I’d rushed to the toilet. I silently prayed he was in his office or the living room and wouldn’t discover the candy I’d hidden.\n[1975-09-30 19:46:00] driveway | I heard my father in the living room above, so I urinated in the bathroom and washed my hands. The soft sound of running water echoed in my ears. I felt a deep silence throughout the house.\n[1975-09-30 19:50:00] home | I quickly slipped into the room and dumped the candy under the blanket, hiding it. Then I walked out into the hallway. I heard Dad call from the living room, 'Grete Lundnes, is that you?' I replied, 'Yes.'\n[1975-09-30 19:55:00] home / bathroom | I went downstairs to take off my coat. I saw Dad come out as well. I heard him ask where I had been. I answered that I’d gone around old Tibåken with Karl. He asked why I was wearing my coat, and I explained it was because I’d rushed to the toilet. I felt his cold gaze fixed on me. I was very nervous and tried hard to make my voice sound normal.\n[1975-09-30 20:00:00] hallway / bedroom | I hung up my coat and rushed back to my room, tucking the blanket tightly over the hidden candy. I turned on the small yellow lamp on my desk, and the light filled the room. I felt unsafe having the candy exposed like that.\n[1975-09-30 20:05:00] hallway | I sat on the bed, guarding the blanket covering the candy. I felt extremely uneasy because I wasn’t sure what I should do next.\n[1975-09-30 20:06:00] hallway | I opened the borrowed space book. I knew it was a book from Dad’s childhood. Inside, I saw drawings of futuristic rockets, astronauts, and strange planetary landscapes. I wanted to read to hide my anxiety.\n[1975-09-30 20:10:00] bedroom | I saw Dad open the door and stand motionless in the doorway, staring at me. I immediately snapped the book shut and sat up straight. I noticed he didn’t enter the room—just kept staring. I thought there was no way he could know something was hidden under the blanket.\n[1975-09-30 20:15:00] bedroom | I heard Dad ask, 'What’s in there?' I replied, 'Where?' I insisted there was nothing under the blanket.\n[1975-09-30 20:20:00] bedroom | I saw Dad stride over and yank the blanket off my bed. I felt him grab my ear and twist it hard. I heard him shout that I was a lying little brat. I cried and explained, 'An old lady gave me the money! I didn’t do anything wrong!' I was caught completely off guard, crying from the pain, and in my mind I wondered: How could he possibly know!\n[1975-09-30 20:30:00] bedroom | I felt my ear twisted even tighter. I cried out and begged him to stop. I heard Dad order me to look at him, asking if I had lied. I also heard him demand to know why an old lady would give me money. I screamed, 'Ow! Ow!' I felt deeply wronged and couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t believe me.\n[1975-09-30 20:31:00] bedroom | I saw Dad stare at me, then point toward my blanket. I heard Dad ask, 'What’s in there?' I nervously replied, 'Where?' I tried to argue, but he insisted it was under the blanket. I still refused, shouting, 'There’s nothing under the blanket!'\n[1975-09-30 20:32:00] bedroom | I saw Dad staring at me, then he strode over to the bed and yanked the blanket off violently. He suddenly reached out, grabbed my ear, and twisted it hard. I heard him shout that I had lied to him, how dare I lie to my own father.\n[1975-09-30 20:33:00] bedroom | I started crying from the pain and injustice. I protested, 'That's not what I meant!' I heard him demanding where the candy and money came from. Through tears, I answered, 'An old lady gave me the money! I didn't do anything wrong!'\n[1975-09-30 20:34:00] bedroom | I felt him twist my ear even tighter, and I screamed in pain. I heard Dad repeat 'old lady' with deep suspicion, demanding why she would give me money. In agony, I cried 'Ow! Ow!' He ordered me to shut up and demanded whether I was lying.\n[1975-09-30 20:35:00] bedroom | I was forced to lift my head and look at him. I saw flames of anger burning in his eyes, and I heard him command again for me to look at him when speaking. Finally, I admitted, 'Yes.'\n[1975-09-30 20:36:00] bedroom | I saw Dad signal for me to follow him. I heard him press me on where the money really came from. I kept sobbing it was from an old lady. He cursed me as a 'lying brat' and ordered me to go with him.",

    "text": "[1975-09-30 20:37:00] bedroom / office | I felt him gripping my ear tightly, forcing me to stand. I whimpered and sobbed as he dragged me toward the office. I cried in defense, 'I didn't... do... anything... wrong,' insisting the money was something we'd earned. He said coldly, 'Down to the office.' I felt my mind go completely blank.\n[1975-09-30 20:38:00] office | I saw him shove open the first door, slamming it hard against the wall. Then he dragged me through the second door and threw me onto the office floor, finally letting go. I heard him demand once more where the money came from, warning me not to lie. I sobbed, 'We helped... an old lady... pull a tree out of the stream...'\n[1975-09-30 20:39:00] office | I heard him ask suspiciously, 'She gave you money just for that?' I said yes. When he asked how much, I said five kroner. Then I heard him conclude that I was lying.\n[1975-09-30 20:40:00] office | I felt overwhelming injustice welling up inside me, and I couldn't help shouting. I screamed desperately, 'I'm not lying!'\n[1975-09-30 20:41:00] office | I felt his slap strike my cheek, silencing my shouts. I saw him straighten up and walk toward the desk. I heard him growl quietly, 'Don't yell!' Then he said, 'There's a way to check this. I'll call the old lady.'\n[1975-09-30 20:42:00] office | I watched Dad walk over to the desk, pick up the receiver, and start dialing. He asked me where the old lady lived, and I whispered, \"Old Tibaken.\"\n[1975-09-30 20:43:00] office | I watched Dad press the receiver against his ear, waiting for the call to connect. I heard Dad say into the phone, \"Yes, hello, this is Grete Lundnes. It's about my son. He says he got five kroner from you today. Is that true?\" A deathly silence fell in the office.\n[1975-09-30 20:44:00] office | I saw Dad put down the receiver. I heard him tell the person on the other end that he hadn't seen any boy, nor had he given anyone money. After apologizing, he hung up. He looked at me and said, \"She didn't see any boy. At least, she didn't give anyone five kroner.\" Listening to him, I could hardly believe my ears.\n[1975-09-30 20:45:00] office | I saw Dad shake his head at me. I pleaded desperately, \"But it's absolutely true! We got five kroner.\" I heard him respond coldly, \"That's not what she said.\"\n[1975-09-30 20:46:00] office | I felt fresh tears welling up again, and I continued sobbing. I heard Dad declare that the lies had to stop, demanding to know where the money came from. Through sobs, I insisted, \"From... that... old... lady!\"\n[1975-09-30 20:47:00] office | I saw Dad staring into my eyes. I heard him coldly decide to end the conversation, ordering me to throw away the candy and go straight to my room in confinement. He also mentioned he would talk to Presbakkmo.\n[1975-09-30 20:48:00] office | I protested, \"But this isn't mine! It belongs to Karl Larsdal too—I can't just throw the candy away.\" I heard him retort that if I'd been claiming all along it was mine, then how come now it wasn't?\n[1975-09-30 20:49:00] office | I saw Dad glaring at me furiously, his gaze sending chills through me. I heard him command, \"Do as I say. I don't want to hear another word from you. You steal, you lie, and you refuse to admit it! Upstairs—go to your room.\" I sensed he was on the verge of exploding.\n[1975-09-30 20:50:00] kitchen / bedroom | I walked out of the office, feeling Dad right behind me. I went upstairs to my room, grabbed all the candy, threw it into a garbage bag in the kitchen, and finally returned to my room.\n[1975-11-15 10:00:00] various places in Tibaken | That autumn and winter, I often went with Karl to visit Ingeborg and Lilund's house. I noticed we used flashlights to light our way through the woods in the dark. We also played around the shipyard dock and beneath the massive concrete pier. I saw the flashlight beams cutting through the trees. As far as I know, we even ventured into the backsides of hills we'd never explored before. I knew that autumn and winter were the times we visited them most frequently. In late 1975, we roamed across construction sites and forests.\n[1975-12-06 14:00:00] junkyard | I remember that Saturday when Karl and I set up four chairs, a table, a lamp, and a cabinet in the woods. I saw furniture neatly arranged in the woods, like an outdoor living room. I noticed that Lilund and Ingeborg were with us too. As far as I know, it was Saturday, December 6, 1975. I thought it was absolutely wonderful—being under the sunlight in the forest, yet feeling just like we were sitting in a living room indoors.\n[1975-12-06 14:10:00] junkyard | I gazed at Ingeborg Lofnes, watching her smooth, light-blue down jacket and white hat. I saw her knee-high boots and that radiant, diamond-bright smile. I felt a slight tremor inside every time I saw her. She seemed so beautiful it actually hurt. I realized even her stern, intense gaze sometimes held its own special charm.\n[1975-12-15 14:00:00] stone island | When it snowed, I went skiing with Karl and two girls. I lay flat on the snow, feeling Ingeborg straddling my back as we slid down the long slope of Stone Island. I felt her legs tightly gripping my spine and her hands clutching my shoulders. I heard her shrieks ringing in my ears as we raced forward at full speed. I smelled the scent of snow everywhere in the air, changing with the temperature. I saw thick fog hanging still among the trees, and fine mist stinging my face. I knew winter had truly arrived in 1975. I learned we wore special raincoats that created almost no friction on the snow. I thought to myself: this is the most wonderful day I've ever experienced. The sensation of tumbling at the bottom of the slope, limbs tangled together, felt utterly intoxicating.\n[1975-12-15 14:30:00] pine forest | I saw the dense fog still quietly suspended in the damp, dark-green pine forest. I felt a thin veil of mist constantly clinging to my face.\n[1976-01-10 10:00:00] construction area | That winter, I noticed magical connections between areas that had once seemed separate. I saw how the Fina gas station and the football field in the woods were linked by the old gravel road. I learned that Ingeborg's house and Lilund's were actually quite close, only separated by a small patch of woods. I heard Marivik Christian point out Lilund’s neighbor to me. I knew it was January 1976. From what I understood, the entire construction area was interconnected—like all roads leading to Rome. I learned you could go from Tienna to Jelsta Lake via Sandum, even taking shortcuts to school. I felt amazed by these new geographical discoveries—places I’d thought were far apart turned out to be nearby. I realized this shattered my previous sense of isolated, closed-off spaces.\n[1976-01-15 16:00:00] Mrs. Yellen's house | Sometimes I went alone or with my family to Mrs. Yellen’s house. I also often watched her clean at our home. I heard Mrs. Yellen teach me the trick for unlocking a door: insert the key, pull it out slightly, then turn. I would also tell her all kinds of personal thoughts. I knew Mrs. Yellen was our family’s cleaner. As far as I knew, she lived next door to Ingeborg’s house. I realized that although she had no children, she warmly welcomed me visiting her home.\n[1976-01-15 16:15:00] by the roadside | I told Mrs. Yellen our secret about throwing stones at cars. I recalled that moment: I raised a stone larger than my hand, stared at the bend in the road, and saw a car roaring toward us. I saw the green fence lining the roadside where we stood, and that the area was situated high above the surroundings. As far as I knew, this was an event from the past. I remembered that Karl and I took turns throwing stones down. I said to myself in my mind: now!\n[1976-01-15 16:15:05] by the roadside | I saw the stone arc through the air and strike the roof of the car precisely. I heard a loud crashing sound, followed by the scream of the engine and the tires screeching against the asphalt. My heart sank. Although I expected to hit it, I hadn’t anticipated such a violent reaction.",

I heard him shout in panic: 'Run!'\n[1976-01-15 16:15:30] by the roadside | I stood frozen in place. I heard a car door slam below, then the engine starting up. I saw the car accelerating toward me. I felt completely paralyzed. I realized I was terrified—so afraid I couldn't move at all.\n[1976-01-15 16:16:00] slope | I saw the car stop about three meters away from me. I saw the driver not open the door, but instead push open the hatch and jump out, walking down the slope toward me with an angry look on his face. I felt my legs shaking violently, almost unable to stand. I felt warm tears rolling down my cheeks.\n[1976-01-15 16:16:10] slope | I watched him storm angrily toward me. I heard him shout, 'It was you who threw that stone!'\n[1976-01-15 16:16:12] slope | I silently nodded at him.\n[1976-01-15 16:16:20] slope | I felt him grab my arms with both hands and shake me hard. I heard him yelling at me, demanding if I knew what I’d done could have killed him. He roared, 'Do you know how much it costs to fix this roof? This—you’re going to pay dearly for this!'\n[1976-01-15 16:16:30] slope | I saw him let go of me. I felt myself crying so hard that my vision blurred, and I could barely see anything.\n[1976-01-15 16:16:40] slope | I saw him straighten up and look down at me. I heard him demand my name. I answered, 'Grete Lundnes.' When he asked for my address, I said, 'North Mountain Loop.'\n[1976-01-15 16:17:00] slope | I saw him stride back up the slope, get into the car, slam the door shut, and drive off with a lurch. I heard his final warning: 'You wait for my call—or rather, let your father wait for my call.'\n[1976-01-15 16:17:30] slope | I collapsed helplessly onto the ground and let out a long breath. I felt all hope had been shattered.\n[1976-01-15 16:18:00] slope | I saw Karl emerge from the field above. I saw him walk toward me. I wiped the tears from my face with my hand. I heard Karl rapidly firing questions at me about what had just happened. He asked why I hadn’t run. I replied, 'I don’t know, but I couldn’t. Suddenly, I couldn’t move.' He suggested I tell my family, but I whispered tremblingly, 'I can’t, I’m too afraid to say it out loud.' I realized he was relieved I hadn’t mentioned him, but I also noticed he was genuinely curious about why I had frozen up.\n[1976-01-15 16:18:30] slope | I heard Karl ask if I had given my father’s name. I said I’d only given my own. He reassured me, 'Your name isn’t in the phone book! He won’t be able to reach your father. Maybe this will just fade away after all!' Hearing him say that, a small flicker of hope reignited inside me.\n[1976-01-15 16:19:00] slope road | I thought about what Karl said, and I felt a little better.\n[1976-01-15 16:20:00] slope road | I continued to dwell in the false sense of security that Karl had given me.\n[1976-01-15 17:00:00] home | I came home and saw Mrs. Yellen there; I told her everything. I felt her gently stroke my face. In the following days, every time I heard the phone ring, I shivered with fear. I heard Mrs. Yellen ask me what had happened. I begged her to swear secrecy, and I heard her agree. She suggested I tell my parents, but I refused. I felt these days were overshadowed. At first, I thought things would simply fade away with time—but I was wrong.\n[1976-01-20 18:00:00] home | I heard the telephone ring, and Dad answered it downstairs. About three minutes later, I heard the extension click as it was hung up. I knew it had finally come—the moment I'd been dreading.\n[1976-01-20 18:03:00] bedroom | I sat on the bed and started crying. I heard Dad hang up downstairs, then heard his heavy footsteps climbing the stairs. He went into Mom’s room first, and then the two of them came together to push open my door. I heard loud noises coming from next door. I saw their faces dark and grim, extremely serious. I knew the truth had come out—this unprecedented confrontation filled me with overwhelming panic.\n[1976-01-20 18:05:00] bedroom | I heard Dad demand sternly, 'Someone just called me saying you threw a large rock at his car and damaged the roof. Is that true?' I whispered, 'Yes.' He went on angrily, 'How could you do such a thing? You could have killed him! Do you realize how serious this is?'\n[1976-01-20 18:06:00] bedroom | I heard Mom add, 'If that rock had hit the front windshield, he might have swerved off the road or crashed into another car. He could have died.' I replied softly, 'Yes.'\n[1976-01-20 18:07:00] bedroom | I saw Dad turn his head away. I heard Dad say furiously, 'Now I’ll have to pay for the repairs—thousands of kroner. We don’t have that kind of money! Where are we supposed to get it?' I whispered I didn’t know. I heard him exclaim in disgust, 'Oh, damn this child!'\n[1976-01-20 18:08:00] bedroom | I quietly admitted, 'Yes, but I told Mrs. Yellen.' I heard Mom scold, 'And you’ve said nothing until now—this happened a week ago. You should have told us. You must promise to do so in the future.' Then I heard Dad shout in shock, 'You told Mrs. Yellen—but not us?'\n[1976-01-20 18:09:00] bedroom | I saw Mom and Dad both staring at me, demanding answers. I heard Mom repeatedly question why I had thrown a rock at the car, asking if I knew how dangerous it was. I answered, 'We thought we wouldn’t hit it.' I heard Dad sharply interject, '“We”? How many of you were involved?' I had no choice but to confess, 'Karl Larsdal threw one too, but my rock was the one that hit the car.'\n[1976-01-20 18:10:00] bedroom | I saw Dad first look at Mom, then turn his head and stare at me. I heard Dad tell Mom that he needed to talk to Presbakkmo. Then he sternly announced to me, 'You're not allowed to leave your room tonight, or the next two nights either. No allowance this week or next week. Understood?' I mumbled, 'Understood.'\n[1976-01-20 18:15:00] bedroom | I knew that about a year ago, I had run away from home over a knife incident—it was another unfortunate event. I thought everything would pass. I felt that the time between the incident and its exposure was filled with boundless darkness; though the surface was calm, I trembled inside, finding this life utterly terrifying.\n[1976-02-15 10:00:00] Tibaken | I saw that due to the warming weather, snowbanks on the roads had turned into ice mixed with gravel. I saw children playing kick-can in the street or practicing unicycling on the sidewalk. I felt the morning air still carried a biting chill, but the scent of burning dry grass—sharp and strong—had begun to drift through the air. I saw the sky appear deep blue, and the nights filled with the noise of children playing. I knew the house arrest had ended and my allowance had returned. As far as I knew, Ingeborg and Lilund never came down into the woods—we always went up to them. I learned that when spring came, we would go skating at Tjerna, where the echoes from the ice were wonderfully strange. I felt that every day in this world was filled with immense joy.\n[1976-03-10 20:00:00] Ingeborg Lofnes's house / bedroom | I saw that sometimes we played table tennis in Dalson’s garage, or played Chinese chess in Karl Larsdal’s room. I knew being up there with the girls was an entirely different world. I realized that even when they weren’t around, this happiness would well up inside me. I thought of Ingeborg Lofnes; I felt her presence strike me with such powerful force that I became dizzy with joy and longing.",

    "text": "[1976-03-15 10:00:00] school / Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I smelled the pleasant fragrance in their room. I saw that her room was full of pink gauze, dolls, and skirts. I noticed the oxygen tank in her father’s basement. I knew her father was a diver. I learned that when she played 'Bridge Bridge Brille,' she would wrap her arms around me. I felt that this emotion also included affection for her family. I realized the unspoken understanding when she played with me at school. I thought, if I could, I would spend my whole life chasing after her, just for the chance to hold her in my arms.\n[1976-03-20 10:00:00] home | At the time, I didn’t know it couldn’t last forever. I thought back then that life would just keep going, keep going like this.\n[1976-04-01 10:00:00] construction area | I saw myself switching to lightweight running shoes and replacing my bulky foam jacket with lighter clothes. I saw classmates stuffing their coats into backpacks when school let out at noon. I felt the lightness that spring brought. I saw the sun low in the sky, its rays slanting directly into my eyes. I noticed the weather growing warmer and warmer. I knew the skis and sleds had been stored in the basement. I learned that bikes and footballs were being taken out again.\n[1976-04-10 19:00:00] construction area | I saw children either chasing balls or practicing bicycle stunts. I smelled the odor of burning last year’s dry grass and twigs—it was everywhere. I felt the night air still icy cold, with chill rising from the snowbanks along the roadside. I knew this smell of burning vegetation was the most unmistakable sign that spring had arrived.\n[1976-04-10 20:00:00] neighbor's garden | I ran up to watch the neighbor burn the fire. I saw adults wearing gloves, standing by the fire with rakes on their shoulders. I saw small, wavelike flickers of orange-red flame dancing in the blue darkness. I saw the flames grow vivid and moist in the twilight, their color unbelievably beautiful. I thought the parents guarding the fire looked like some kind of lower-middle-class knights.\n[1976-04-10 20:10:00] neighbor's garden | I saw yellowish-red flames shoot straight into the sky, heard the crackling of burning branches and the hissing of melting plastic. I wondered in my mind: What did this fire mean? I felt it seemed so ancient, so out of place among the nearby mobile homes and toy excavators. I marveled at how beautifully changeable the patterns of the flames were.\n[1976-04-10 20:20:00] neighbor's garden | I saw cars driving around on the road. I know these houses, water pipes, and cars are all part of our modern living environment. I imagined another world composed of natural elements—coming with fire and vanishing with fire. I realized that although we live in modern times, fire is so ancient. I felt that while our emotions belong to us, they have actually existed since the dawn of humanity.\n[1976-04-10 20:30:00] neighbor's garden | As children, I thought we had no history—every experience was the first. I felt emotions surging through my chest, making me want to scream or laugh. At that moment, I truly believed this would last forever.\n[1976-04-15 18:30:00] living room at home | I imagined the scene beyond the bay north of Leivik. I knew a fishing boat sank that night, and all seven sailors on board perished.\n[1976-04-15 18:30:10] living room at home | I knew that the next morning, every newspaper reported it, and everyone considered it an incredible mystery.\n[1976-04-15 18:30:20] living room at home | As far as I knew, the weather had been calm when the accident occurred, and the boat vanished without even sending out a distress signal.\n[1976-04-15 18:30:30] living room at home | I saw on the TV screen footage taken by a helicopter—only an empty expanse of sea remained. I learned that a television station had sent a helicopter to survey the site that night.\n[1976-04-15 18:30:45] living room at home | I saw beneath a cloudy sky, gray-green waves slowly and heavily rising and falling. I noticed this rhythm was entirely different from those churning waves capped with white foam.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:00] living room at home | I sat there alone, watching all of this unfold on television.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:05] living room at home | I thought, back then, my father was probably working outside in the garden.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:15] living room at home | I stared intently at the sea surface on the screen. I realized I hadn't heard a word the announcer said. A face's contour suddenly emerged from the sea surface before my eyes.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:25] living room at home | I don't know how long the image lasted—perhaps only a few seconds. But I realized it had already left an extremely strong impression in my mind.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:30] living room at home | At the very instant the face disappeared, I abruptly stood up. I ran out. I thought I had to immediately find someone to tell about what I'd just seen.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:35] living room at home | I knew Mother was working the night shift and my brother had gone to a football match. I realized most other kids wouldn’t listen to me. I thought the only person I could possibly tell right now was Dad.\n[1976-04-15 18:31:45] entranceway/stairs | I rushed down the stairs, quickly put on my shoes and jacket. I opened the door and started sprinting around the house.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:00] yard | I slowed down, beginning to walk more carefully. I realized I was about to enter Dad’s line of sight, and I remembered we weren’t allowed to run around wildly in the yard.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:10] backyard vegetable plot | I saw Dad standing behind the house, at the spot meant to become a vegetable garden. He was holding a large sledgehammer, striking a protruding rock.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:20] backyard vegetable plot | I saw the dark soil turned up beneath his feet. I noticed the dense grove of catalpa trees beyond the fence casting a dim shadow over the hillside.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:30] backyard vegetable plot | I saw Father straighten up and turn toward me. In the shadow, his face was almost completely dark.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:35] backyard vegetable plot | I thought that even though I couldn’t clearly see his face, I still had enough information to guess his mood.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:40] backyard vegetable plot | I thought I didn’t need to deliberately interpret his thoughts—I could understand his state simply by intuitively observing his body language.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:45] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him put down the hammer and take off his gloves.\n[1976-04-15 18:32:50] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him ask me, \"What's wrong?\"\n[1976-04-15 18:32:55] backyard vegetable garden | I stopped in front of him on the grass. I said to Dad, \"Just now on TV I saw a face in the sea.\" I smelled the strong, fresh scent of pine drifting through the air from the stump outside the stone wall. I learned that it was from the pine tree the neighbor had cut down earlier that afternoon.\n[1976-04-15 18:33:05] backyard vegetable garden | I heard Dad reply, \"A diver's face?\" I knew he must have asked that because I liked divers. I felt a little annoyed inside: couldn't he think I'd come running for some other new thing?\n[1976-04-15 18:33:10] backyard vegetable garden | I shook my head at Dad.\n[1976-04-15 18:33:15] backyard vegetable garden | I told him, \"It wasn't anyone's face—it was a picture in the sea.\"\n[1976-04-15 18:33:25] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him pull out a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket. I heard him mutter, \"A picture, really now.\"\n[1976-04-15 18:33:30] backyard vegetable garden | I nodded, turned around, and started to walk away.\n[1976-04-15 18:33:32] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him call after me, \"Wait.\"\n[1976-04-15 18:33:40] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him strike a match and lower his head to light the cigarette. I saw the flame draw a bright small circle in the dimness.\n[1976-04-15 18:33:45] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him begin to speak: 'So then...'\n[1976-04-15 18:33:55] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him take a deep drag from his cigarette, rest his foot on the rock, and stare off toward the distant forest or up at the sky.\n[1976-04-15 18:34:05] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him lift his head and look at me. I heard him ask: 'What you saw was a picture of Jesus, wasn't it?' I knew I was a Christian, and that often embarrassed him. I realized no other child around here called themselves that. I thought if his tone hadn't been so friendly just then, I would've felt he was mocking me. I realized he actually wished I could be like other ordinary kids—less different.\n[1976-04-15 18:34:15] backyard vegetable garden | I felt surprised, because I realized he actually cared about me. But at the same time, I felt a small disappointment, as though he underestimated my understanding.\n[1976-04-15 18:34:20] backyard vegetable garden | I shook my head at him again.\n[1976-04-15 18:34:25] backyard vegetable garden | I told him: 'It's not Jesus.'\n[1976-04-15 18:34:30] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him smile slightly. I heard him say: 'That answer is acceptable.' I heard the faint hiss of bicycle tires scraping against pavement from far down the road—a sharp, clear whooshing sound coming from the top of the hill.\n[1976-04-15 18:34:45] backyard vegetable garden | I saw Dad flick the cigarette butt beyond the yard fence after finishing it. I saw him pull his gloves back on and grip the hammer. I heard him cough a few times.\n[1976-04-15 18:34:55] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him raise his head and look at me again. I heard him say firmly: 'Don't think about it anymore.'\n[1976-04-15 18:35:05] backyard vegetable garden | I heard the sound of the hammer striking rock echo throughout the neighborhood.\n[1976-04-15 18:35:10] backyard vegetable garden | I saw a car coming up the sloping hill from the main road, passing one streetlight after another.\n[1976-04-15 18:35:20] backyard vegetable garden | I saw my neighbor's front door open, Presbakk mo stopped below the steps, put on his work gloves, gripped the handle of the wheelbarrow, and walked into the grass. I noticed he took a deep breath of the crisp night air.\n[1976-04-15 18:35:30] backyard vegetable garden | I smelled the gunpowder scent from my father blasting rock on the other side of the mountain, along with the odor of pine stumps beyond the stone wall, freshly turned soil, the forest, and a faint trace of salt carried by the northern breeze. Through these scents, I realized my father was busy at work on the far side of the mountain.\n[1976-04-15 18:35:40] backyard vegetable garden | I thought about the face I had seen in the sea, realizing that although only minutes had passed, it had completely transformed into my father’s face.\n[1976-04-15 18:35:50] backyard vegetable garden | I saw him down there drilling holes and hammering at the rock.\n[1976-04-15 18:35:55] backyard vegetable garden | I heard my father ask me, “Are you still standing there, child?”\n[1976-04-15 18:36:00] backyard vegetable garden | I nodded to him.\n[1976-04-15 18:36:05] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him command, “Go back inside immediately.”\n[1976-04-15 18:36:10] backyard vegetable garden | I began walking back.\n[1976-04-15 18:36:12] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him say, “Listen.”\n[1976-04-15 18:36:15] backyard vegetable garden | I stopped and turned my head to look at him, puzzled.\n[1976-04-15 18:36:20] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him say sternly, “Don’t run this time.”\n[1976-04-15 18:36:25] backyard vegetable garden | I stared at him without moving a muscle. I wondered silently—how did he know I had just run over?\n[1976-04-15 18:36:30] backyard vegetable garden | I heard him say disdainfully, “Stop gaping like that—you look completely like a fool.”",

    "text": "[1976-04-15 18:36:40] front yard/house front | I closed my mouth as he told me to, then slowly walked back around the house.\n[1976-04-15 18:36:50] road in front of the house | I noticed the older kids standing grouped together, pushing their bicycles. When I reached the front of the house, I saw the road outside was filled with children. The older ones’ figures almost blended into the dim twilight.\n[1976-04-15 18:37:00] road in front of the house | I saw the younger children playing kick-the-can, the loser now punished by standing inside a chalk-drawn circle on the road.\n[1976-04-15 18:37:10] road in front of the house | I saw others hiding in the woods below the road, avoiding the seeker’s gaze. I realized that although they thought they were well hidden, I could actually see them clearly.\n[1976-04-15 18:37:20] road in front of the house | I saw the last rays of sunset piercing through the bridge pillars, painting the dark treetops with a faint red glow.\n[1976-04-15 18:37:30] road in front of the house | I noticed headlights illuminating the cyclists, catching glimpses of black eyes and pale faces flashing past in the light and shadow. I saw a brand-new car coming up the hill, its headlights glinting off mirrors and metal parts.\n[1976-04-15 18:37:40] road in front of the house | I saw the children playing a game barely make way for the car, then stand aside making faces and staring at it.\n[1976-04-15 18:37:50] road in front of the house | I knew these were Mr. and Mrs. Trolnes, the parents of my classmate Karin Ingrid. After observing, I thought it seemed Karin hadn't come along with them.\n[1976-04-15 18:38:00] road in front of the house/inside the house | I turned around, followed the car’s taillights with my eyes until they disappeared over the hilltop, then went back inside.\n[1976-04-15 18:45:00] my own room | I tried lying in bed reading for a while. I realized I couldn’t settle down completely.\n[1976-04-15 18:50:00] Henrik Inge's room | I walked to Henrik Inge's room and looked out through the window there. I wanted to observe Dad’s movements from this vantage point.\n[1976-04-15 18:50:10] Henrik Inge's room | When I saw him, I realized how well I knew him; I felt the most important thing was to have clarity in my mind.\n[1976-04-15 18:50:20] Henrik Inge's room | I think I’ve long been familiar with his thoughts and moods—something I’ve figured out over time—and I know how to calibrate my actions to achieve the desired outcome.\n[1976-04-15 18:50:30] Henrik Inge's room | I feel this allows me to prepare in advance, almost like making a mental and spiritual weather forecast.\n[1976-04-15 18:50:40] Henrik Inge's room | I heard the car drive up the slope, the engine cut off, the door lock clicked, and the faint sound of him taking off his coat by the entrance. I paid attention to how he glanced around when getting out of the car and all his movements upon entering—I believed all of this carried signs, everything could be interpreted.\n[1976-04-15 18:50:50] Henrik Inge's room | I pondered where he had been, how long he’d stayed, and who he’d been with—though these became pieces of information, the only thing I truly knew was that I withdrew before drawing any conclusions.\n[1976-04-15 18:51:00] Henrik Inge's room | I realized what frightened me most was that he had managed to find me, and for some reason, I hadn't foreseen even the slightest sign.\n[1976-04-15 18:51:10] Henrik Inge's room | I wondered in my mind—how on earth did he know I'd come running over?\n[1976-04-15 18:51:20] Henrik Inge's room | I knew he never believed my explanations about where I spent my allowance, just like that autumn when I hid the candy because I guessed he would come into the room. I realized this wasn’t the first time he’d seen through my thoughts in a way I couldn’t understand.\n[1976-04-15 18:51:30] Henrik Inge's room | I watched him walk into the room and stand there staring at me. I heard him ask, “What have you hidden in your bed?” I felt uneasy during those few silent seconds he stood there.\n[1976-04-15 18:51:40] Henrik Inge's room | I wondered inside, how could he possibly know?\n[1976-04-15 18:52:00] Henrik Inge's room | I noticed he usually stood under that bright lamp while working. I saw Presbako turn on the bright outdoor lamp on the stone pavement outside.\n[1976-04-15 18:52:10] Henrik Inge's room | I saw the patch of light shining in the darkness filled with piles of junk, and Presbako standing motionless, gazing at it all.\n[1976-04-15 18:52:20] Henrik Inge's room | Before me lay scattered paint cans, wooden planks, and old bicycle frames. I noticed fresh spring buds sprouting from discarded milk cartons, along with toolboxes and advertising signs piled against the wall.\n[1976-04-15 18:52:30] Henrik Inge's room | I deduced that such an abundance of clutter might mean he had a hobby room in his cellar.\n[1976-04-15 18:53:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw my father approaching the lawn with a hammer in one hand and a spade in the other, so I quickly stepped back a few paces.\n[1976-04-15 21:28:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw Henrik Inge push the door open and come in. I glanced at my watch and noticed it was two minutes to nine-thirty.\n[1976-04-15 21:28:10] Henrik Inge's room | I saw him lurching up the stairs step by step. I noticed his distinctive duck-like gait—I thought this must be the way we had learned to walk quickly yet silently inside the house.\n[1976-04-15 21:28:20] Henrik Inge's room | I saw that his face was flushed as he came up. I noticed he was panting from exhaustion.\n[1976-04-15 21:28:25] Henrik Inge's room | I heard him ask as soon as he entered: \"Where's Father?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:28:30] Henrik Inge's room | I showed him my watch. I told him: \"Out in the garden. You're not late coming home—look, it's exactly nine-thirty now.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:28:35] Henrik Inge's room | I extended my arm wearing the watch toward him so he could see.\n[1976-04-15 21:28:45] Henrik Inge's room | I watched him walk over and pull out a chair. As he passed by me, I caught the distinct outdoor smell on him—a mix of cold air, forest, and crushed gravel from the road.\n[1976-04-15 21:28:50] Henrik Inge's room | I heard him ask: \"Did you touch my records?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:28:52] Henrik Inge's room | I said: \"No.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:28:55] Henrik Inge's room | I heard him say: \"Then, what were you doing in my room?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:29:00] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"Nothing much.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:29:05] Henrik Inge's room | I heard him say, \"Can't you go to your own room if you're going to do something?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:29:20] Henrik Inge's room | I heard the front door downstairs open again. This time it was Dad’s heavy footsteps crossing the floor below. As usual, he took off his boots outside the door, then went into the bathroom to change clothes. I heard the front door downstairs open again. This time it was Dad’s heavy footsteps crossing the floor below.\n[1976-04-15 21:29:30] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"On the TV news I saw a face in the sea—have you heard about this? Do you know if anyone else saw it too?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:29:40] Henrik Inge's room | I saw Henrik Inge glance at me with a half-questioning, reluctant look. I heard him say, \"What are you babbling about?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:29:45] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"Do you know about that fishing boat sinking?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:29:50] Henrik Inge's room | I saw him give a slight nod.\n[1976-04-15 21:29:55] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"On TV they showed the location of the wreck—I saw a face in the sea there.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:30:00] Henrik Inge's room | I heard him say, \"A corpse?\"\n[1976-04-15 21:30:05] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"No, it wasn't a real face. It was the surface of the sea itself forming the shape of a face.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:30:15] Henrik Inge's room | I saw that for a moment he just looked at me, not saying another word. Then he bent his index finger and twirled it around his temple several times.\n[1976-04-15 21:30:20] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"You don't believe me? It's absolutely true.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:30:25] Henrik Inge's room | I heard him say, \"It's absolutely true—you're the waste.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:30:35] Henrik Inge's room | Just then I heard my father turn off the faucet downstairs. I thought it would be best to go back to my own room now, so there'd be no risk of running into him in the hallway. At the same time, I didn't want Henrik Inge to have the last word.\n[1976-04-15 21:30:40] Henrik Inge's room | I said, \"You're the waste.\"\n[1976-04-15 21:30:50] Henrik Inge's room | I saw he couldn't even be bothered to respond. He only turned his head toward me, baring both rows of teeth like a rabbit, and blew a puff of air through the gap. I knew this mimicry referred to my protruding teeth.\n[1976-04-15 21:31:00] hallway/my room | Before he could notice that tears had begun to well up in my eyes, I turned and walked out of the room. Being alone for a long time doesn't mean anything—it's bearable. Did I win this round? Just because he didn't see me cry?\n[1976-04-15 21:31:10] my room | As soon as I stepped into my room I stopped, but Father was already coming up the stairs, so I wiped my eyes with the sleeve of my sweater. For a split second, I thought I should go to the bathroom. There I could wash away the traces with cold water.\n[1976-04-15 21:31:20] my room | I felt the thin layer of tears covering my eyes smeared sideways by the dry sleeve, distorting the appearance of everything in the room, altering its colors. It felt as if I had suddenly sunk beneath the surface of water, as though I were now seeing things from underwater.\n[1976-04-15 21:31:30] my room | So I raised both arms and made swimming motions in the air, slowly walking back toward my desk. I extended this imagined scene further.",

    "text": "[1976-04-15 21:31:40] my own room | I knew that those who walked on the seabed back then wore shoes made of lead, incredibly heavy, and their thick, bulky diving suits made them look as clumsy as elephants, with the oxygen tubes fastened to their heads swaying like trunks. In my mind, I am wearing the kind of iron helmet used by early divers.\n[1976-04-15 21:31:50] my own room | I pant through my mouth, exhaling in small bursts, bringing my feet down heavily one after another, just like their slow, weighty movements on the seabed.\n[1976-04-15 21:32:00] my own room | I kept walking in circles across the floor for a while... Until I felt my horrified imagination entering another stage, beginning to seep extremely slowly into that icy, bone-chilling water region.\n[1976-04-15 21:32:15] my own room | I remember months ago I watched a TV adaptation of Jules Verne's novel *The Mysterious Island*, about several people who descend in a hot-air balloon onto a deserted island in the Atlantic Ocean. I was completely stunned the moment I saw the first scene.\n[1976-04-15 21:32:25] my own room | I thought how this story contained wonders beyond imagination, encompassing everything—the hot-air balloon, violent storms, people dressed in 19th-century clothing, the barren, uninhabited island they landed on, which might not have been as terrible as they imagined, yet one bizarre, mysterious event after another unfolded around them... Who exactly were those people?\n[1976-04-15 21:32:35] my own room | I recalled suddenly finding the answer near the end of that episode. There was movement in the underground water tunnels—creatures resembling humans... From the light of the lamps in their hands, a smooth, mask-covered head flashed past my eyes... I saw it clearly... It looked like a lizard, but walking upright on two limbs... And carrying several others on its back... One of them turned around—it had no eyes...\n[1976-04-15 21:32:45] my own room | When I saw him, I didn’t scream, but I felt those terrifying images pierce through my entire body instantly, flooding my mind so completely that I couldn’t do anything. Even in the bright light of day, whenever I think of those frogmen in the underwater caves, fear utterly shatters me.\n[1976-04-15 21:32:55] my own room | I feel now that the countless thoughts in my mind have transformed me into one of them—I mirror them, and they mirror me. Their steps are my steps, their arms are my arms. The moment I close my eyes, I see those eyeless faces.\n[1976-04-15 21:33:05] my own room | I imagine the underground water caves... the dark, filthy water... the frogmen holding up lamps, marching in a long line... I feel myself sinking too deep, and opening my eyes won’t help. Even if I see myself sitting in my room, surrounded by familiar things, I remain gripped by fear.\n[1976-04-15 21:33:15] my own room | I sat down on the bed, stiff-bodied, grabbing my schoolbag without looking, glancing at the timetable, finding Wednesday, reading the list below: arithmetic, general knowledge of natural geography, music. I’m so afraid I can barely blink, terrified that something might happen.\n[1976-04-15 21:33:30] my room | I lifted my backpack onto my lap and mechanically sifted through the books inside. Then I picked up the open book from my desk, scooted further into bed until my back was against the wall, and began reading intently.\n[1976-04-15 21:34:00] my room | At first, I looked up every few seconds; slowly, the intervals between glances grew to minutes.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:00] my room | Later, I heard my father calling me in the evening—exactly at nine o'clock, as always. I felt that what now governed me was no longer the lingering fear, but the book. It took real willpower to put it down.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:05] kitchen | I knew we weren't allowed to cut our own bread slices or use the electric stove.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:10] kitchen | So I knew dinner was always prepared by either Mom or Dad.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:15] kitchen | I knew that if Mom was working the night shift, Dad would do everything: when we entered the kitchen, two glasses of milk and four slices of bread on two plates would be waiting for us on the table.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:20] kitchen | I knew he usually made the bread slices well in advance and then stored them in the refrigerator.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:25] kitchen | I knew the bread slices were therefore cold and hard, making them a bit difficult to bite into... I felt even if the spread on them was something I liked.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:30] kitchen | I knew that if Mom was home, she—or we—would place all the various side dishes for the bread on the table.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:35] kitchen | I knew this small freedom allowed us to decide which foods went on the table... I felt it also meant we could choose the flavor of our bread slices.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:40] kitchen | I knew the other bread was kept at room temperature, not that cold kind... Of course I also felt a certain freedom: we could open the cupboard, take out cups and plates, let them clink and clatter, and set them on the table; we could pull open the drawer with knives and forks, always rummaging around noisily inside before placing the knife beside the plate; we could put glasses on the table, open the fridge, take out milk, pour it into the glass, and naturally, we could talk aloud.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:45] kitchen | I knew that during dinner evenings with Mom, our topics flowed one after another. We spoke freely, saying whatever came to mind, and she listened with genuine interest. I felt that if I spilled a bit of milk, or got carried away and absentmindedly placed a used tea bag on the tablecloth (Mom sometimes made us tea), it didn’t matter at all.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:50] kitchen | I knew the extent of this freedom we enjoyed during meals... I realized this freedom changed in a regular way depending on how close Dad was to us.\n[1976-04-15 22:00:55] kitchen | We would talk loudly and freely, adding whatever gestures we pleased; if he came up the stairs, we would naturally lower our voices, and if we felt the topic wasn't suitable for him, we'd immediately change it; when he entered the kitchen, we fell silent at once, sitting upright and serious, as if we were fully focused on our meal; conversely, if he went into the living room, we'd continue chatting, but quietly and carefully. I knew that if he was outside or downstairs in his office...\n[1976-04-15 22:01:00] kitchen | This evening, when we walked into the kitchen... I saw four prepared slices of bread waiting for us on the plates, each topped with different accompaniments.\n[1976-04-15 22:01:10] kitchen | I knew one slice had brown goat cheese, one had yellow cheese, one had sardines mixed with tomato, and one had clove cheese. I didn’t like sardines, so I decided to pick up that slice first.\n[1976-04-15 22:01:15] kitchen | I knew we ate fish at least once a week; another option was steamed fish... other kinds were prepared the same way—boiled cod, boiled cobia, boiled herring, boiled pollock, boiled sole, boiled mackerel, boiled Leivik pollock, and so on. The thing I hated most was fish—boiled cod made me feel nauseous... it tasted bland and looked flabby in my mouth.\n[1976-04-15 22:01:25] kitchen | I could eat the tomato as if it were some kind of tomato sauce... I thought the sardine flavor was the worst... but that fish was so greasy, especially those tiny, slippery tails, which were disgusting.\n[1976-04-15 22:01:35] kitchen | I usually bit them off first, set them aside on the edge of my plate, used the crust of a bread slice to dab up some tomato sauce, then tucked the little tails inside and rolled them up together. That way, I could chew a few times without touching them directly, then swallow everything down with a few gulps of milk. To avoid touching them as much as possible...\n[1976-04-15 22:01:45] kitchen | That would naturally be to just stuff them all into my pants pocket. Thinking that if Dad weren’t present, like tonight...\n[1976-04-15 22:01:50] kitchen | When I did that, I saw Henrik Inge raise his eyebrows, shake his head. Then he laughed. I smiled back at him.",

    "text": "[1976-04-15 22:02:00] living room | I heard my father shifting in his chair out in the living room. I heard the sound of fumbling with a matchbox. After the brief crackle of sulfur striking the rough side of the box, came the sound of tobacco catching fire, and then everything settled into the silence of the flame.\n[1976-04-15 22:02:10] kitchen | I saw Henrik Inge lean forward and open the window, trying not to make any noise. A few seconds later, I smelled cigarette smoke drifting into the kitchen.\n[1976-04-15 22:02:15] kitchen | I heard sounds pouring in through the window from the dark outdoors, and felt how the atmosphere in the kitchen suddenly changed. All at once, this place became part of the open wilderness beyond. I felt as if we were sitting on a submerged rock. This strange thought made the hairs on my arms stand up.\n[1976-04-15 22:02:20] kitchen | I felt the wind rising, heard its rustling pass through the trees, making the shrubs and trees on the lawn below swish and rattle. From the street corner came the voices of a few young people leaning on their bicycle handles, talking. Up the slope toward the bridge, a motorcycle was revving its engine. Far away, the chugging motor of a boat entering the fjord rose above all other sounds.\n[1976-04-15 22:02:25] kitchen | I think he must have heard me! The sound of my footsteps running on the gravel path!\n[1976-04-15 22:02:30] kitchen | I saw him point to the slice of bread covered with lilac cheese. I heard Henrik Inge whisper, 'Shall we swap?'\n[1976-04-15 22:02:35] kitchen | I took a small sip of milk to wash down the last piece of sardine sandwich, then began eating the slice Henrik Inge had placed on my plate. I said, 'Okay.' I felt truly delighted—this mystery that had troubled me was finally solved.\n[1976-04-15 22:02:40] kitchen | I believe the proper distribution of milk is important. When you reach the last piece of bread and there's no milk left, it's almost impossible to swallow. The best way is to save a little milk with each slice. Drinking milk without mixing it with anything else, without serving any other function, just purely pouring it down your throat—that’s when milk tastes best. Unfortunately, I’ve hardly ever experienced this pleasure. The reason is this: pure milk brings joy, but its role as an aid for swallowing always seems more important than savoring its taste.\n[1976-04-15 22:02:45] kitchen | I realized Henrik Inge managed it. He was an expert at planning and saving.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:00] kitchen | I heard Presbakk Moe upstairs stomp several times with the heel of his boot against the door. I heard three short, sharp shouts pierce through the night.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:05] outside | I heard someone shout: \"Karl Larsdal! Karl Larsdal! Karl Larsdal!\"\n[1976-04-15 22:03:10] outside | I heard a response coming from the yard in front of Fosson's house... Everyone could tell he hesitated in his reply; I certainly understood there was something on his mind.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:15] outside | I heard him shout back: \"Coming!\"\n[1976-04-15 22:03:25] living room/kitchen | Right after that, I heard his footsteps running outside. As he neared the fence of Oskar Magnus’s yard, I heard my father stand up in the living room. The way his feet moved across the floor made me shrink down a little. I saw Henrik Inge hunching his neck too.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:30] kitchen | I saw my father walk into the kitchen, go over to the dining table, say nothing, but simply bend down and slam the window shut.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:35] kitchen | \"We don't keep windows open at night,\" he said.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:40] kitchen | I saw Henrik Inge nod.\n[1976-04-15 22:03:45] kitchen | I saw my father look at us. \"Now finish your dinner quickly,\" he said.\n[1976-04-15 22:04:00] kitchen | As soon as he returned to the living room and sat down, my eyes met Henrik Inge’s. \"Ha, ha,\" I whispered.\n[1976-04-15 22:04:05] kitchen | \"Haha?\" he responded softly, \"He was mostly talking about you.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:05:00] kitchen/own room | I saw him get up, walk back to his room and slam the door shut, but I stayed sitting there for a few more minutes, chewing my bread. I noticed he had finished almost two slices more than I did.\n[1976-04-15 22:05:10] kitchen | I thought about how the original plan was to go to Dad after dinner and tell him that the face from the sea would be replayed on the evening news. After some consideration, I changed my mind and decided it was better not to mention it. Or should I? I decided I’d wait and see how things unfolded.\n[1976-04-15 22:05:30] kitchen/living room | I knew that when leaving the kitchen, I usually turned into the living room to say goodnight to him. I figured if his voice sounded calm—and especially if he seemed willing to talk—then I’d bring it up. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mention it at all.\n[1976-04-15 22:05:40] living room | I saw that he wasn’t sitting in one of the two leather chairs in front of the TV as usual, but instead was seated on the sofa—the spot farthest inside the living room. I stepped several paces further into the room. It was unfortunate—he was sitting on the sofa. I realized I couldn’t just pass by casually and turn to say goodnight. I’d have to walk in deliberately, making it obvious that I had something extra to say. I thought that if I didn’t speak directly, the whole purpose would be lost. No matter what tone he used, I had to say it.\n[1976-04-15 22:05:50] living room | Before stepping out of the kitchen, I hesitated and paused, so I took four steps forward to make sure he could see me. I hadn’t noticed this unexpected situation before leaving the kitchen, and suddenly I felt I had no choice. He must have heard me stop, and would quickly realize I wanted to say something to him.\n[1976-04-15 22:06:00] living room | I saw him sitting there with one leg crossed over the other, his elbow resting on the arm of the sofa, head slightly tilted back and supported by one hand. He shifted his gaze—from having looked upward toward the ceiling—to look at me.\n[1976-04-15 22:06:05] living room | I said, \"Good night, Dad.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:08] living room | I heard him reply, \"Good night.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:15] living room | I said, \"They definitely showed the same footage on the evening news—I just wanted to mention that, so you and Mom can watch it.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:20] living room | I heard him say, \"What image?\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:25] living room | I said, \"An image of a face.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:30] living room | I heard him say, \"A face?\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:35] living room | I stood there and saw how suddenly his jaw dropped and his mouth opened wide. I thought my mouth must have been gaping open too. I realized he was imitating me again.\n[1976-04-15 22:06:40] living room | I said, \"I've told you about this before.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:45] living room | I saw him close his mouth, straighten his body, and keep staring at me with fixed eyes. I heard him say, \"You've babbled enough about this face—let's end it here.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:06:50] living room | I answered, \"Yes.\"\n[1976-04-15 22:10:00] my own room | I turned toward the hallway, brushed my teeth, took off my clothes and put on my pajamas, turned on the bedside lamp before switching off the room light. After lying down, I began reading. I could feel his attention had already shifted away from me.\n[1976-04-15 22:15:00] my own room | That's how the evening went—I read until half past ten. I knew we were technically only allowed to read for half an hour before bed, until ten o'clock. But usually I'd read until Mom came home, around half past ten.\n[1976-04-15 22:30:00] my own room | I placed the book on the floor and turned off the light. I heard a car coming up the driveway from the main road, and lay in the dark listening to every sound she made: locking the car door, footsteps on the gravel path, the front door opening, taking off her coat, footsteps ascending the stairs...",

    "text": "[1976-04-15 22:30:10] my room | I felt that once she was in the house, the atmosphere changed completely. The most incredible thing was that I could sense this—like when I had already fallen asleep before she came home; waking up in the middle of the night, I would know she was there. Something in the air had shifted, though I couldn't pinpoint what exactly, except for a sense of peace and something else beyond it. Likewise, if she returned earlier than expected while I was still outside: the moment I stepped into the hallway, I knew she was in the house.\n[1976-04-15 22:30:20] my room | I heard her place the keychain on the telephone table before stepping onto the stairs, slide open the door, say something to Dad inside, then close it behind her. I naturally wanted very much to talk with her, yet I also felt no need to tell her about the face. Most important of all was that she was here.\n[1976-04-15 22:30:30] my room | I knew that sometimes, especially after weekend night shifts, when Mom came home, Dad would always prepare a late-night snack. They would listen to records together. Occasionally, after they left, a bottle of red wine from the state alcohol store would be left on the kitchen counter—always the same brand. Beer was rarely drunk, but when it was, it was always the same brand: two or three Pilsners from Ålanda Brewery, in brown 0.7-liter bottles with a golden sailing ship logo.\n[1976-04-15 22:30:40] my room | Just before eleven, I slipped out of bed, tiptoed down the hall, pulled the sliding door open a crack, and peeked at the TV news inside. I noticed they hadn’t been drinking tonight. I was glad about that. They never watched TV while eating, which allowed me to carry out my simple yet somewhat risky plan.\n[1976-04-15 22:30:50] my room | I had never done anything like this before—not even thought about it. If something wasn’t allowed, I simply didn’t do it. Never. I had never done anything Father forbade me to do—at least not intentionally. But this was different, because it wasn’t about me; it was about them. I had already seen the face in the sea—there was no need to see it again. I just wanted to know whether they would see the same thing I did.\n[1976-04-15 22:50:00] my room | Lying in the dark, lost in thought, I followed the flickering green glow of the alarm clock. All around was silence, yet I could hear cars moving along the main road below.\n[1976-04-15 22:50:10] my room | The sound of cars began climbing the hill past the newly opened B-Max supermarket, continued downward through Hult, drove on past old Tibaken, then climbed again until the bridge. There, the cars vanished as suddenly as they had appeared half a minute earlier, leaving no trace behind.\n[1976-04-15 22:51:00] my room | I knelt on the bed and looked out the window. At nine minutes to eleven, the door of the house across the street opened. It was Mrs. Oskar Magnus, walking up the path with a garbage bag in her hand.\n[1976-04-15 22:51:10] my room | I knew Mrs. Oskar Magnus gave the impression of never appearing outside. People might see her indoors, or perhaps sitting in the passenger seat of their blue Ford Taunus—I knew this, though I had never really thought about it before. This was truly rare to witness. When I saw it, that was the first thought that came to mind.\n[1976-04-15 22:51:20] outside (observing) | I saw her stop by the trash bin, lift the lid, drop in the garbage bag, then close the lid. But now... it suddenly struck me—every movement in that sequence carried a kind of lazy elegance typical of many heavyset women. She never used to leave the house.\n[1976-04-15 22:51:30] Outside (observing) | I saw the bright light from the streetlamp outside my fence shining on her, and everything around her—trash cans, the white side of the trailer, the stone paving, the asphalt road—reflecting sharp, cold glimmers that made her silhouette stand out strikingly. Her black shiny sleeves, the faintly glowing fabric of her white sweater, and her thick ash-brown hair that almost seemed gilded in the light.\n[1976-04-15 22:51:40] Outside (observing) | I saw her standing there for a moment, looking around. First at the Presbakkmo house, then turning toward the Hansen place, then down toward the woods across the road. She ran one hand along her arm, then turned and went back inside. I saw a cat strutting up below, pausing to glance at her.\n[1976-04-15 22:56:00] My room | I checked my watch again. Four minutes to eleven. A chill came over me, and I briefly considered putting on a sweater, but then thought further—if I did that, it might look as if I had planned all this in advance. Besides, it wouldn’t take more than a few minutes.\n[1976-04-15 22:56:10] My room | I carefully moved to the door and pressed my ear against it. The only risk, I thought, was that the bathroom was on this side of the sliding door. That meant I could control things—if they got up, I’d have time to retreat. But now the sliding door was closed, and if they were coming this way, I wouldn’t realize it until it was too late.\n[1976-04-15 22:56:20] My room | I thought, well, at least I can pretend I need to use the toilet!\n[1976-04-15 22:58:00] Hallway | After the problem was easily solved, I carefully opened my bedroom door and stepped into the hallway. I tiptoed down the hall, stopped at the sliding door, heard no sound, and pulled it open slightly to peer through the crack. Silence. I felt the dry carpet rubbing against my sweating feet.\n[1976-04-15 22:58:10] Living room (spying) | I saw the television in the corner. The two leather chairs were empty. They were both sitting on the sofa—both of them were there.\n[1976-04-15 22:58:15] Hallway | I felt everything was perfect.\n[1976-04-15 23:00:00] Hallway/Living room | I saw the Earth with an N-shaped mark spinning endlessly on the TV screen. I prayed to God that the news segment would replay, so my parents could see the same images I had seen.\n[1976-04-15 23:00:10] Hallway/Living room | I heard the announcer’s lead story about the sunken ship. The image on screen wasn’t the calm sea, but a local policeman and a woman holding a child being interviewed. They stood talking, with the churning sea behind them. My heart began to race.\n[1976-04-15 23:00:30] hallway | When the news ended, I heard my father speaking inside the house, then laughter. A feeling of shame instantly spread throughout my body, so intense that I couldn't think. It was as if my entire being turned pale and blank.\n[1976-04-15 23:00:40] hallway | I realized that this sudden sense of shame from childhood—its strength could only be compared to the deepest fear within, or a sudden burst of anger. At such moments, all three feelings had one thing in common: my whole self seemed erased, reduced to nothing. Of course, it was merely emotion at work.\n[1976-04-15 23:01:00] hallway | So I turned and walked back to my room, indifferent and oblivious along the way. I knew the window by the stairs must be utterly dark, reflecting the image of the hallway. I knew Henrik Inge's bedroom door must be closed, just like my parents' bedroom and the bathroom door. Everything shut tight.\n[1976-04-15 23:01:10] my room | I knew Mom’s keychain must still be on the telephone table, like a small wild beast lying in a fable—the leather head, the iron legs pressed tightly together. I knew the knee-high ceramic vase with dried flowers must have scattered dead leaves onto the floor nearby, as if completely disconnected from the wall-to-wall synthetic carpet. But I saw nothing, heard nothing, and thought of nothing.\n[1976-04-15 23:01:20] my room | I went into the room, lay down on the bed, and turned off the light.\n[1976-04-15 23:01:30] my room | I drew a deep breath inward, began to tremble slightly, and at the same time my abdominal muscles tightened; a sob forced its way out of my mouth, loud enough that I had to muffle it with the soft pillow. The pillow quickly became soaked. When darkness seized me...\n[1976-04-15 23:05:00] my room | I felt this method really worked—like when you feel nauseous and finally vomit, bringing relief. Long after the tears stopped, I still lay there, softly sobbing. Crying wasn’t bad at all. And it also helped bring everything to a close.\n[1976-04-15 23:10:00] my room | I lay flat on the bed, rested my head on one arm, closed my eyes, and fell asleep.",

    "text": "[1976-04-25 14:00:00] school | One day at the end of April, when I told Ingeborg Lofnes we were going up to their place after school... I saw her give a sly smile. I said, \"After school we're coming up to your place.\" She said, \"You can't come.\" \"Why not?\" I asked. \"Someone else is coming,\" she said. \"Who is it?\" I asked, thinking maybe an uncle or aunt, or some other relative. \"It's a secret,\" she said. I thought maybe it was an uncle or aunt, or some other relative.\n[1976-04-25 14:05:00] school | I said, \"Is it someone from class? Marianne, Solveig, or Wenche?\" She said, \"It's a secret. You can't come. Bye!\"\n[1976-04-25 15:00:00] woods / construction area | I went to Karl Larsdal and told him what she had said. We agreed to go up and quietly follow them. After school, we walked home with our backpacks, then took a different path upward, cutting diagonally across the construction area in the lower woods where the foundations of new houses had already been laid. We tiptoed through the trees, crossed the marshy ground, and made our way toward the curved driveway between their houses.\n[1976-04-25 15:30:00] Vimund's doorstep | We walked down. Karl Larsdal went to ring the doorbell at Vimund's house. I saw Vimund come out and stand in the doorway, his round face wearing a foolish expression. I saw that no one was there.\n[1976-04-25 15:35:00] Vimund's doorstep | I heard him say they had just gone down a short while ago. I asked, 'Just the two of them?' He said, 'No, with two others.' I asked, 'Who were they?' He said he didn't know—he hadn't seen them. I asked, 'Boys or girls?' He thought they were boys. At first, he thought it was us two, since we're often around here, but he realized it was two different ones!\n[1976-04-25 15:40:00] Vimund's doorstep | I saw him smile. I saw Karl Larsdal smile too. I wondered, who could they be? What were they doing together with them?\n[1976-04-25 15:45:00] on the path | I stared wide-eyed at him. I saw him nod, and then we crossed their property boundary and came down onto the road below. I said to Karl Larsdal, 'Come on, let's follow them.' Karl Larsdal said, 'But they don’t want us to, right? Shouldn’t we just go inside and hang out with Vimund for a bit?' I said, 'OK.' I told Vimund, 'Don’t tell anyone else.'\n[1976-04-25 15:55:00] near Marivik·Kristian's house | We walked up the path leading to their house. We stopped at the crossroads on the uphill stretch toward Marivik·Kristian’s place and theirs. I saw Karl Larsdal shrug his shoulders. Then we stepped onto the gently sloping gravel path. I saw Marivik·Kristian’s house sitting in a small hollow. I saw the garage beside the house, filled with bicycles, tools, and tires. I saw firewood stacked beneath the balcony. Where could they have gone? Based on what we knew, they might already have gone all the way down to the shop. But someone said they were somewhere near this house. I thought they should be easy to see and hear, since there were four of them together.\n[1976-04-25 16:05:00] woods | When we reached the top of the little hill, I saw Marivik·Kristian standing in the window on the short wall side of the house, watching us. We didn’t look at him, but instead walked straight across their property and entered the woods on the other side. Just below the slope near Lilund’s house, I saw movement—flashes of blue and red. I saw the distant grove of young saplings.\n[1976-04-25 16:10:00] woods | We stopped, completely still. I heard Karl Larsdal whisper, 'They’re there.'\n[1976-04-25 16:15:00] woods | I saw Karl Larsdal shaking his head. We moved closer, keeping our bodies hidden behind trees as much as possible. When we got within about twenty meters, we crouched down behind a rock. I whispered, 'Can you tell who they are?'\n[1976-04-25 16:20:00] woods | I peeked my head out to look at them. I saw it was Kristine Lof and Karl Larsdal·B. with them. I thought, it’s Kristine Lof and Karl Larsdal·B.\n[1976-04-25 16:25:00] woods | I know they are neighbors and best friends, living over near Karin Ingrid’s place, who in turn lives around Siv’s area—you can see Siv’s house from our road. I know Kristine Lof is one of the best in the class, and so am I—one of the best in the class. I thought to myself, damn it! Kristine Lof and Karl Larsdal·B., classmates! What sets us apart from them? Almost nothing! They’re each other’s best friends, and so are we. I think both Karl Larsdal·B. and Karl Larsdal are followers.\n[1976-04-25 16:30:00] woods | I saw him hanging on a dry branch, trying to snap it off. I saw Karl Larsdal·B. standing on the other side, giving it all he had to help break it. I saw Ingeborg Lofnes and Lilund standing nearby, watching. I felt that Kristine Lof was better than me. As for me, I’ve got buck teeth and a sticking-out bottom. He’s stronger than me too.\n[1976-04-25 16:35:00] woods | I thought they were showing off for the two of them. I muttered inwardly, damn it, hell!\n[1976-04-25 16:40:00] woods | I whispered to Karl Larsdal, “What now?” He whispered back, “Don’t know—should we go beat them up?” I chuckled quietly, “Ha ha, they’re stronger than us.” I wondered what we should do. Should I just walk over to them as if I knew nothing? Join them, six of us together? I turned toward Karl Larsdal.\n[1976-04-25 16:45:00] woods | I heard him say, “Well, shall we turn back?” I said, “Okay, let’s go home.”\n[1976-04-25 17:00:00] on the way home | We sneaked back the way we came. A few meters out, I turned to look at him. I saw him pick up a branch, swinging it around in his hands, first striking one knee, then the other, walking upward along the brick wall on the sidewalk. On my way home, I cried almost the whole time, walking steadily along the path past the football field. I thought no one could see me there.\n[1976-04-26 09:00:00] at home | Early Saturday morning, I ran up to Karl Larsdal’s place, but he was going into town with his parents. I saw Mom and Dad vacuuming, washing, cleaning the entire house. I know this happened on Friday. I know Henrik Inge and Gretevik took the bus into town together, so I was left completely alone.\n[1976-04-26 09:30:00] bathroom / bedroom / basement | I went into the bathroom, closed the door, rummaged through the laundry basket, found a brown, ugly corduroy pants, put them on, slipped into my room, pulled out that hideous yellow knitted sweater, put that on too, then dashed down the stairs unnoticed into the basement room, picked up the ugliest pair of boots among mine, stepped into them in the hallway. I took down the thin gray jacket I wore last spring from its hook—I had to leave it unzipped. Dressed in clothes so ugly I could barely stand them, I began walking up the slope toward the housing area where Ingeborg Lofnes lived. The whole way, my eyes stayed fixed on the ground. I thought people seeing me would understand how sad and hurt I was. If I ran into Ingeborg Lofnes—that was the whole point of this walk—I wanted her to see what she’d done. Wearing these awful, filthy clothes, head bowed low, everything I did was meant to make her realize it.\n[1976-04-26 10:00:00] near Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I know Bjorn Bell is a year younger than me, and playing with him really makes no sense. Though he plays football and is already quite mature for his age. I won’t ring the doorbell, because then I’d have to talk to her. Not ringing it means she has to see me by chance, unintentionally, so she’ll understand how deeply what she did hurt me. When I reached Vemund’s house, she still hadn’t seen me, so I walked up the path toward her house. That might ruin my plan, but if not to meet her, what else was I doing here today?\n[1976-04-26 10:05:00] near Ingeborg Lofnes's house | I stood for a moment at the turnaround spot, then after a while walked down into the woods, past the newly laid foundations, construction machinery, and work sheds. I stood there a while, looking at the newly built parish hall and the muddy field where we used to play football. Slowly, I continued walking downward. I thought about whether I should go see Bjorn Bell. But just looking at the house where she lived made me feel so sad.",

    "text": "[1976-04-26 10:15:00] near Kristine Lof and Karl Larsdal·B.'s house | We've come up here several times before, playing together, and when the first snow of winter fell, we took them ice skating in Tjøna. Once we even attended Karl Larsdal·B.'s birthday party. I had lost the ten-kroner note I meant to give him; when I arrived, the envelope was empty. Wearing my best clothes, I started crying. Fortunately, his father went with me to search. We walked back along the path I had taken, and there, on the black asphalt road shimmering with blue light, I saw the ten-kroner banknote lying on the ground. I knew halfway along the route I would pass, sheltered by cliffs and trees, lived Kristine Lof and Karl Larsdal·B.\n[1976-04-26 10:20:00] roadside garden | I saw a boy standing on the lawn of a garden beside the road—long black hair and an Indian-like face—kicking a ball around with his feet. I heard him say: \"Hi.\" I said: \"Hi.\" He said: \"How many can you do like that?\" I said: \"Four.\" He said: \"Ha, what's that?\" \"Well, how many can you do?\" \"Sixteen.\" I said: \"Then show me.\"\n[1976-04-26 10:21:00] roadside garden | I saw him balance the ball motionless on the top of his foot. He pulled his foot back slightly, quickly tossed the ball into the air, and began kicking it with the instep—one, two, three—then the ball drifted too far away. For the last kick, he had to stretch his leg completely out just to reach it, and the ball flew toward the fence. I said: \"That’s four.\" He said: \"It’s because you’re standing here distracting me. One more time. Will you wait and watch?\" I said: \"Sure.\"\n[1976-04-26 10:22:00] roadside garden | This time I saw him kick the ball up to about knee height, shifting it from one knee to the other five times before losing control again. I said: \"Eight.\" He said: \"Yeah, but now I’ll show you properly.\" I said: \"I have to go.\" He said: \"OK.\"\n[1976-04-26 10:25:00] sidewalk | I saw his father—a fat man with glasses and thick gray hair—standing at the window watching us. I ran across the road to the sidewalk on the other side, immediately slowed down, and started walking with my head lowered again. I suddenly remembered I was wearing a hideous, sloppy outfit.\n[1976-04-26 10:30:00] driveway at home | When I reached the bottom of the slope, I saw Dad backing the car out of the driveway. He waved at me and leaned over from his seat to open the door. I heard him say: \"Get in, we're going into town.\" I said: \"But I'm all dirty—can I change first?\" He said: \"Don't be silly, get in now!\"\n[1976-04-26 10:31:00] inside the car | I pulled up the small handle next to the seat so I could slide it forward. I heard him say: \"Just sit in front.\" I said: \"In the front seat?\" He said: \"Yes, we don’t have all day! Get in now!\"\n[1976-04-26 10:32:00] inside the car | I did as he said. When I closed the door, he shifted gears and the car began moving downward. I heard him say: \"Yeah, you're a bit grubby, but we're only going for a short while. It doesn’t matter.\"\n[1976-04-26 10:35:00] inside the car | I started fiddling with the seatbelt, not paying attention to the road, until the buckle clicked into place—I realized then we were heading up toward the bridge. I heard him say: \"I want to check out the fish market and also Music Corner. Want to come along?\" I said: \"Yes.\"\n[1976-04-26 10:40:00] inside the car | I saw him steering with one hand, the other resting on the gearshift, a lit cigarette between his fingers—driving fast, as he always did.\n[1976-04-26 10:45:00] beside the Videsholmens Shipyard | I saw the Videsholmens Shipyard to my left, with its enormous lizard-shaped cranes and glass halls. The parking lot outside was mostly empty. I knew there was a huge oil platform here, and that a deep-water concrete structure would be launched next week.\n[1976-04-26 10:50:00] Songe Road | After passing through a small passage, we drove onto the road toward Songe, when he glanced at me. \"You were out with Karl Larsdal today?\" he said. \"No,\" I said, \"they're in town.\" \"Maybe we'll run into them—wait and see,\" he said.\n[1976-04-26 10:55:00] inside the car | He looked at me. I heard him say: \"We'll always find a place.\" Then silence again. It puzzled me—he was in such a good mood, I should say something. But what? After a while I got an idea. I said: \"Where are you going to park the car?\"\n[1976-04-26 10:56:00] inside the car | I said: \"Not on top of the skating rink, I hope? There's always space there on Saturdays.\" He said: \"Only if there's no other choice. Understand?\"\n[1976-04-26 11:10:00] Tiholmen / Fish Market | I saw him find a spot at Tiholmen. He strode ahead with long legs between the tall wooden houses, and I had to jog to keep up. I watched carefully to see if they were staring at me or laughing. Inside the fish market, Dad scanned all the glass counters while waiting in line for his turn. I felt ashamed of my shabby clothes; among them, I looked like a fool.\n[1976-04-26 11:20:00] Fish Market | I nodded. I stayed silent. He smiled, looking at me. I heard him say: \"We'll take some shrimp, what do you say?\" He added: \"Maybe some cod too.\" He said: \"I know you don't like cod. But it's good for you. When you grow up, you'll come to like it.\" I said: \"I seriously doubt that.\"\n[1976-04-26 11:25:00] Fish Market | I wanted so much to talk about everything related to me, the way I told Mom, but with him, I already backed down inside. Still, I was very happy he had brought me along—and more importantly, he knew I was happy.\n[1976-04-26 11:30:00] Fish Market | It was his turn. I saw him point to what he wanted from the counter. One of the women behind the counter stared at him. When she noticed me watching her, she lowered her eyes and continued wrapping the fish lying on the wooden board before her. Back then, something about my father, something connected to him as he pointed at fish and spoke, made me think: he was trying to shake off, to get rid of, everything surrounding him. Not his appearance—the unshaven face, pale blue eyes, lips slightly twisted—but something else, something that radiated outward from him.\n[1976-04-26 11:40:00] Mosgen (Pollen) | I saw him carrying the white bag with shrimp and fish. As we walked toward the music corner, beside him, I did little hurdle-like jumps to show I was happy. When he looked at me, I smiled. I heard him say, as he took the change: \"Alright, now—we're off!\"\n[1976-04-26 11:50:00] Music Corner | I saw him smooth his hair back with his hand. I nodded and took the bag, while his fingers quickly flipped through the records. In the music corner, I heard him say: \"Can you hold the bag for me?\" I felt the wind coming from the bay, messing up his hair.\n[1976-04-26 11:55:00] music corner | I knew that after we went to sleep, they usually played music, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. When he was alone in his office, he often put on records too. Gretevik once said that he brought a Pink Floyd record to class and played it for them. He spoke of it with reverence.\n[1976-04-26 12:00:00] music corner | Dad suddenly said, \"Don't you want to pick out a cassette for yourself?\" I said, \"But I don't have a tape player.\" He replied, \"You can borrow Henrik Inge's, and besides, by Christmas you can have one of your own. So it's good to have some tapes ready. What use is an empty tape player!\"\n[1976-04-26 12:05:00] music corner | I hesitantly walked over to the cassette tapes. Unlike records, they weren’t kept in boxes; instead, they were hung on shelves mounted on the wall. One of them contained only Elvis songs. I could picture him on the cover, dressed in leather, guitar resting on his knee, smiling broadly.\n[1976-04-26 12:10:00] music corner | Dad bought two records and carried them to the counter, telling the clerk I would also be picking out a cassette. I saw the clerk take a small key and walk over to the shelf. I pointed at the Elvis tape, and he unlocked it, took it down, placed it in a small bag, and set the little bag beside Dad’s larger one.\n[1976-04-26 12:20:00] on the way | As we walked toward the car, I heard Dad say, \"Good choice, Elvis—did you know he was my favorite singer when I was young? We used to call him Elleville Presseløs. I still have some of his old records at Grandma and Grandpa’s place. Maybe we’ll go get them sometime? Then you could listen to them.\"\n[1976-04-26 12:25:00] on the way | I said, \"Yeah, that would be great—maybe Henrik Inge would like to listen too.\" I glanced over toward Rocky, I heard him say, \"These days, those old records are quite valuable.\" I saw the giant oil tankers moored in Galtisund. They were so massive they nearly touched the low dock, seeming as if they came from another world.\n[1976-04-26 12:30:00] inside the car | Dad opened the door for me on my side. He placed the records on the back seat, lit a cigarette before fastening his seatbelt, while I had already buckled up. Then the car started moving. I said, \"Can I still sit in front?\" He said, \"Yes. But just today. Understand?\" I said, \"Understood.\"",

    "text": "[1976-04-26 12:45:00] on the way home | On the way home, I sat there, sometimes looking at the cassette cover, sometimes gazing out the window. I saw the long pier jammed with traffic, only clearing up gradually as we reached the lower area on the other side... crossing the bay—the sea flecked with white foam... but on land, the road wound and twisted... everything trembling slightly in the wind coming from the south.\n[1976-04-26 12:50:00] inside the car | Suddenly, thoughts of Ingeborg Lofnes flooded back, and my mood sank again. Maybe it was because of that deep-water concrete structure—if only I could have taken them both up to the bridge to see how they were dragged through the water. That won’t happen now. Or maybe it still could? She hasn’t been to my room yet. Every night before falling asleep, I imagine her sitting there, on my bed, surrounded by my things—this thought always sends fireworks exploding inside me—Ingeborg Lofnes, here, with me!\n[1976-04-26 12:55:00] inside the car | I saw below us the bay connecting east and west. A small boat was heading toward land, nearing the shore—I spotted a figure at the stern, gripping the rudder. I wondered why Kristine Lof had replaced me, going to her instead. How happy we were together! Kristine Lof must disappear. The two of us must make up again. But how can we make that happen?\n[1976-04-26 13:00:00] the driveway | Dad signaled a left turn, the blinker flashing as the car slowed. After two cars passed, he drove across the intersection and onto the final uphill stretch leading to the house. I saw Toya Moen, Helen Stergåsen, Karlsen, Thomas Linddal, Karl Larsdal·B., Karl Larsdal, and Viktor Lunddal playing football on the road. As we drove past, they looked our way while the car turned into the driveway. I stepped out of the car and raised my hand high in the air toward them.\n[1976-04-26 13:01:00] the driveway | I shook my head. I heard Viktor Lunddal shout, “Aren’t you coming to play football?” I said, “No, it’s time for dinner.”\n[1976-04-26 13:02:00] the driveway | Walking toward the house, just out of their sight, I felt Dad grab my hand. Then he let go. I heard him say, “Let me see, haven’t those warts gone away yet?” I said, “No.”\n[1976-04-26 13:03:00] the driveway | I heard him say, “Do you know how to get rid of them?” I said, “No.” He said, “Let me tell you. I’ve got an old remedy. Come to the kitchen later, I’ll tell you all about it. You want to get rid of them, don’t you?” I said, “Yes.”\n[1976-04-26 18:00:00] bedroom / kitchen | After going upstairs, the first thing I did was throw my dirty trousers and sweater into the laundry basket and change back into the clothes I’d worn that morning. Then I placed the cassette cover face-out against the wall on the top of my desk. After that, I went down to the kitchen, where Dad was sitting with a small plate of shrimp in front of him. Mom was outside in the living room watering the plants.\n[1976-04-26 18:05:00] kitchen | I saw him stand up, open the fridge, take out a small white packet, place it on the table, and unwrap it. It was bacon. I heard Dad say, “We’ve just enough time to do this before you eat. It’s almost like some kind of magic trick. When I was little, my grandmother used to do this for me. It really works. Back then, I had warts all over my hands. A few days later, they were completely gone.” I asked, “What did she do?” He said, “Just wait and see.”\n[1976-04-26 18:10:00] kitchen | I held out one hand. He took it in his, picked up a strip of bacon, and carefully rubbed it over all my fingers, the back of my hand, and my palm. I heard him say, “First I’ll rub the bacon over your fingers. Then we’ll go out to the garden and bury the bacon in the soil. Your warts will be gone in a few days.” I asked, “Really?” He said, “Yes! It’s truly amazing! The warts really disappear—just wait and see! Now hold out your paw.”\n[1976-04-26 18:12:00] kitchen | I held out my other hand. He took another strip of bacon and repeated the process. I nodded. I heard him say, “That hand.” He asked, “Did I cover everywhere?”\n[1976-04-26 18:15:00] kitchen / garden | I followed him downstairs, put on my boots without letting them touch my hands, and walked behind him—he carried a shovel—as we went around the house and into a vegetable patch beside the fence facing the woods. I heard him say, “Now we’ll go outside. You have to take the bacon out and bury it in the ground.”\n[1976-04-26 18:20:00] garden | I saw him drive the shovel into the soil, press it down with his foot, and begin digging. A few minutes later, he stopped. I did as he told me, and then he dug a few more shovelfuls before we returned inside. I heard him say, “Now you can put the bacon in.”\n[1976-04-26 18:25:00] kitchen | I asked, \"Can I wash my hands now?\" He said, \"Yes, it's the bacon we buried that will get rid of the warts.\" I asked, \"How long will this actually take?\" He said, \"Hmm... a week or two. It depends on how much you believe in it.\"\n[1976-04-26 19:00:00] the road | After dinner I went back out onto the road. I saw that no one was playing football anymore, but Karlsen, Viktor Lunddal, and Toya Moen were still outside. They were running toward the wall by the roadside to see how far up they could climb before falling down. I thought that if they ran fast enough, maybe by the third or fourth step upward, gravity would take over and pull them down. If someone got higher up, he’d fall backward flat on his back—so this was a game that required caution.\n[1976-04-26 19:10:00] the road | For the first time—and the only time—I proceeded very carefully, because just before me, Karlsen had fallen into the ditch by the roadside due to overconfidence. With a thud, all the air seemed to be knocked out of his chest. He let out a shrill, distorted cry to refill the empty space in his lungs, while fighting back tears, as if still wanting to carry on.\n[1976-04-26 19:15:00] the road | I saw Karlsen get back on his feet, turn his body sideways with his back facing us, gasping for breath. When he turned around again, everyone could see that he had been crying, but no one said anything. I heard Viktor Lunddal ask, \"So, what do we do now?\" I wondered why no one spoke up. If it had been me crying, they surely would have said something.\n[1976-04-26 19:20:00] the road | I saw Klepp ride up from down the slope on his bicycle. He wore a black coat and a black hat. His bike swayed slightly from side to side, and his loose, red cheeks jiggled back and forth just like the two Hagakollen grocery bags hanging from either end of his handlebars. Now he had turned onto the road where we were standing, so I had my chance. I ran alongside him for a bit, pretending to peer into the bags on his handlebars. I shouted to the others, \"There are beer bottles in the bags!\" I knew he was Håvard’s father. Håvard was a boy who lived in the house farthest from ours, already seventeen years old—an older figure we admired, though we rarely saw him. There were rumors that his father was an alcoholic.\n[1976-04-26 19:25:00] the road | I saw that Klepp didn’t pay much attention to me. But the others laughed.\n[1976-04-27 10:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I knew their house was identical to mine—same room layout, same orientation—but still vastly different. For them, the home was arranged purely for practicality: chairs needed to be comfortable to sit on, not merely pleasing to look at. Our house, by contrast, stood almost as a symbol of constant cleanliness, while their tables and floors were cluttered with things left wherever they’d been used. Their way of living had become part of the house itself, just as ours had—but we lived in completely different ways. The next day we sat in Karl Larsdal’s room, writing love letters to Ingeborg Lofnes.\n[1976-04-27 10:10:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I knew it was nearly unimaginable for Karl Larsdal’s father to work alone with tools—he always involved Karl Larsdal and Gro as much as possible in whatever he was doing. Downstairs they had a carpentry workbench where nails could be hammered, wood planed, glue applied, and surfaces sanded smooth. If we wanted, say, to build a wheelbarrow or what we called a go-kart, we’d go to him first. Their garden wasn’t as neat, orderly, or symmetrical as ours—the result of my father dedicating all his time to perfection—but grew more naturally, organized entirely around utility. For example, an unsightly compost heap occupied a large portion of their yard. Similarly, behind their house grew a dense patch of bare, weed-like potato plants, whereas behind ours lay a lawn and a circular rhododendron bush.\n[1976-04-27 10:20:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I knew that Karl Larsdal’s room was in the same position as mine, his sister Gro’s room corresponding exactly to Henrik Inge’s room, and his parents’ room located between them, just like in our house. Karl Larsdal could move freely between all the rooms, running up and down the stairs at will. If he wanted a piece of bread, he could take whatever toppings he liked from the fridge and spread them himself.\n[1976-04-27 10:30:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I could do the same there—if I wanted, I could move freely between their rooms or make myself a piece of bread with Karl Larsdal. We often sat in the living room listening to his record of Knutsen & Ludvigsen, laughing frequently—at the record, or at Karl Larsdal, who not only knew every lyric by heart but could also imitate their tone and performance style perfectly. Karl Larsdal didn’t play football; he was poor at all ball games, partly due to lack of coordination, but also because of disinterest. I sensed he would never feel, as I did, that surge of excitement throughout my whole body when playing football. I often spent entire afternoons kicking a ball around on muddy ground, and when dusk fell and everyone left, I felt a deep sense of loss and longing—emotions completely foreign to him.\n[1976-04-27 10:40:00] school / Karl Larsdal's house | At school, he wasn't doing well either. He had poor reading skills and was slow with numbers. It was hard for him to repeat or express anything he'd read or heard in class, but he managed to get by. For him, he didn't rely on football or school. Because he was good at imitation, a group of people began gathering around him—they would stand there listening to him talk about school. He enjoyed it; laughter made him lose himself, like pouring oil on fire, making his words grow more and more exaggerated. But even this wasn't something he truly depended on. It was as if he had a small world entirely his own.",

    "text": "[1976-04-27 10:50:00] Karl Larsdal's house | For example, drawing. He could sit in his room and draw all day long. Or build model airplanes—this was another thing he often did. He would let out loud, crude bursts of laughter, sometimes even hysterical fits that were impossible to control. He loved farting—maybe far more than others—and he’d experiment with it, even discussing it openly with people.\n[1976-04-27 11:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I write this letter while he draws a picture. In the drawing, a boy is stepping on a heart, and two other boys are standing by watching. Beneath the drawing, I write in red ink: Kristine Lof broke our hearts. I know he has an older sister, Gro, which might be why he wasn’t shut out from the world of girls the way I was from the beginning. Still, the idea of love letters excited him.\n[1976-04-27 11:05:00] Karl Larsdal's house | The letter itself has five lines: Dear Ingeborg Lofnes, we are heartbroken. Come back to us. Can you hear how much we love you?\n[1976-04-27 11:30:00] below Ingeborg Lofnes's window | We held the letter and the drawing like two contracts, rolled them together, and went up toward her place. From the cliff above where Mrs. Jæren lived, we entered the area beneath her window. We tossed a small pebble at the window, and she appeared. First, we showed her the drawing. She smiled at us, so we tore both the letter and the drawing into pieces, stomped on them with our feet, then left. We couldn't give the drawing and the letter to Ingeborg Lofnes because, as far as we knew, she might show them to others—even people at school—and then everyone would laugh at us. So we decided to only show them to her.\n[1976-04-27 11:40:00] near Ingeborg Lofnes's house | Now we know she at least understands our feelings. Now everything depends on her.\n[1976-04-27 11:50:00] crossroads | Karl Larsdal stopped at the crossroads. I shook my head. I said, 'I'm going over to Vimd,' he said, 'Or do you want to come along?' As I walked down, I thought I should also go visit a new friend. Maybe Marivik Christian? But that seemed a bit strange, not quite natural, so I decided to go home instead.\n[1976-04-27 14:00:00] bedroom | I was lying in bed reading for a while when Henrik Inge came in and asked if I wanted to go outside and kick a ball around. I wanted to. Nothing pleased me more than being with Henrik Inge. Most often, we played chess indoors or listened to music together, but once outside, we usually split up—he with his friends, me with mine—except during holidays, when we’d play football, table tennis, or badminton together. Situations like this one were purely accidental, happening only when he felt bored and had no other friends nearby except me.\n[1976-04-27 14:30:00] on the road | We stayed there for over an hour, kicking the ball back and forth between us. At one point, Henrik Inge shot the ball toward me, and I practiced kicking it away. Then we continued passing it to each other.\n[1976-05-15 10:00:00] at home | My warts are gone. They kept getting smaller, and after about three weeks, they disappeared completely. The skin on my hands became so smooth.\n[1976-05-20 10:00:00] school / home | But Ingeborg Lofnes never came back. Before, when I took off her hat or tugged at her scarf, or suddenly covered her eyes from behind, she would let out frightened screams, but now she became annoyed, even angry. When I saw her walking toward the bus with Lilund, Kristine Lof, and Karl Larsdal·B., my heart ached. Every night before falling asleep, I imagined how I might save their souls, or make her understand everything in some other way—make her realize her mistakes and change her mind. Or else I imagined that if I were already dead and she realized she actually wanted to be with me, but it was too late—\n[1976-05-20 22:00:00] in fantasy | Now I am already lying in a coffin surrounded by flowers. Great sorrow and regret will fill her completely. During that time, death was a sweet thought—not only because Ingeborg Lofnes would regret what she had done, but also because Dad surely would feel the same. They stand before my coffin, weeping for my early death. The entire housing estate gathers there, and everyone’s thoughts are about me. They will reassess who I was, and because I no longer exist, the person I actually was will become clearer and sharper in people’s memories than ever before. Yes, death is sweet and beautiful, a tremendous comfort.\n[1976-05-25 10:00:00] school / home | Though I was sad about Ingeborg Lofnes, she was still there—I could see her at school every day. As long as she was there, there was hope, however slight. Thinking of her plunged me into a kind of darkness, entirely different from the waves of gloom that sometimes swept over me—this one brought complete dejection, making me lose interest in everything. Karl Larsdal noticed it too.\n[1976-05-25 19:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house | One evening we sat in his room, and he asked me what was wrong. \"Nothing special,\" I said. \"You're completely silent,\" he said. \"Am I?\" I said, \"I'm just very, very unhappy.\" \"Why?\" \"I don't know. Nothing special. I just can't get myself together.\"\n[1976-05-25 19:05:00] Karl Larsdal's house | \"I feel like that sometimes too,\" he said. \"You do?\" \"Yes.\" \"You just feel bad inside, but don't know why?\" \"Yes, sometimes I feel exactly like that.\" \"I don't understand,\" I said, \"I didn't know other people felt that way too.\"\n[1976-05-25 19:10:00] Karl Larsdal's house | \"Let's call it that,\" he said, \"'like that.' When we feel like that, we can just say it. 'Now I'm like that,' for example—and the other person immediately understands.\" \"That's a good idea,\" I said.\n[1976-05-26 10:00:00] the mountaintop | \"This is called intercourse,\" I told him. \"But you mustn't say you heard it from me! You have to swear!\" He swore. Other new words appeared too, like the real name for mating, which Henrik Inge taught me—\"intercourse.\" The word was so powerful that I didn’t dare tell Karl Larsdal until I’d taken him up to the top of the mountain.\n[1976-05-28 16:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house / Vemund's house | I told him this. Why do you hang out with Vemund? He’s fat and stupid—the worst kid in class. He never answered me seriously, only saying he liked being there. Why? I asked again. What great things can you possibly do together? Nothing, Karl Larsdal said—we mostly just sit there drawing... Besides, he spent more time with Vemund upstairs, and sometimes Vemund came up to his place too. I didn’t understand it at all.\n[1976-05-30 10:00:00] school / Vemund's house | Even in class, when the teacher asked us to work in pairs, sometimes he went to Vemund instead of me—he always used to choose me before. A few times I followed him up to Vemund’s place, just to get closer to Ingeborg Lofnes. But I found what they were doing utterly dull and boring. When I suggested doing something else, they insisted on continuing as they were. I didn’t care—if he wanted to hang out with the dumbest kid in class, let him.\n[1976-06-01 10:00:00] on the road / Hovet | We were still neighbors, and he often came down to me in the afternoons. Also, when spring began, we started playing football together. Almost all the kids on our street played. Training was at Hovet, and my mother and Karl Larsdal’s mother took turns driving us there.\n[1976-06-05 10:00:00] home | When I first started training, Mom bought me a jersey. This was my very first jersey. I had high hopes for it—imagining it might be a shiny blue Adidas, like Henrik Inge’s, or even better, a Puma, or at least something from Hummel or Admiral. But the one she brought home didn’t have any brand at all. It was a brown tracksuit with white stripes. Though I thought the color was ugly, that wasn’t even the worst part. The fabric had no shine—it was dull and coarse, poorly made. It wasn’t a comfortable fit; instead, it clung tightly to my body, making my hips stick out in an embarrassingly noticeable way.",

    "text": "[1976-06-05 16:00:00] the field | When I wore this training jersey, it was all I could think about. Even as I ran onto the field and began practice, it was still the only thing on my mind. My butt sticking out like a balloon, I thought, as I ran after the ball. My training jersey is brown and hideous, I thought. I must look like a fool wearing it, I thought. Fool, fool, fool.\n[1976-06-05 18:00:00] home | So I said, 'Ah, this shirt is great. Really beautiful. Exactly what I wanted.' But I would never tell Mom how I really felt. When I received the jersey, I pretended to be happy because it must have cost her quite a bit, and she’d gone around town searching for it just for me. If I told her I didn’t like it, she’d feel unappreciated, and worse, she’d feel bad for failing to get it right. I didn’t want that to happen.\n[1976-06-05 18:05:00] the field | There were many kids on the field, a swarm of arms, legs, and heads chasing the ball like mosquitoes. The coach could name only a few of them—mostly neighbors from his own district, probably his sons and their friends. One incredible thing about spring training was how vastly different my inner self was from the version of me on the field. My heart was packed full of thoughts and emotions—I wanted to score, to dribble past others, but also kept thinking how terrible my training jersey was, how prominent my big hips were, not to mention my protruding buckteeth—while out on the field, I ran around almost entirely unnoticed.\n[1976-06-07 19:00:00] woods beside the field | My first moment of triumph happened one evening when someone kicked the ball into the woods behind the goal, and it disappeared. Everyone went into the woods to search. For two or perhaps three minutes, we all searched intently. No one found it. Then suddenly, there it was, right in front of me, glowing white under a bush in the twilight. All I did was kick it back onto the field. I walked out of the woods with everyone else, saying nothing. I knew this was my chance. I should have shouted, 'I found it!' and carried the ball proudly back to the field—then the honor would have been mine. But I couldn’t do it. And so it remained a mystery.\n[1976-06-10 19:30:00] the field | About ten or twelve meters from the goal, I was running among a group of players. The ball was there, everyone crowded in, limbs crashing together, everything chaotic. Suddenly, the ball popped up just a meter away from me. I threw myself forward with all I had, and the ball flew straight off the post and into the net. I didn’t say anything, didn’t move—I just stood there quietly. 'Goal!' someone shouted. 'Who scored?' 'Whose goal was it? Nobody?' the coach called out. 'No! Then let’s keep going!' The second time was similar, though it felt more like a gift handed straight to me.\n[1976-06-10 19:45:00] the field | Maybe they thought it was one of their own defenders who scored, so no one claimed it. Though I didn’t dare say it was me, it was my first-ever goal. For the rest of practice, and even on the car ride home, my heart was filled with light.\n[1976-06-10 20:00:00] in the car | As we ran toward the car, Mom was already sitting inside waiting for me. The first thing I said was that I had scored. 'I scored a goal!' I said. 'That’s great!' Mom replied.\n[1976-06-10 20:30:00] kitchen | After we got home, when I sat down at the kitchen table for dinner, I said it again. 'I scored today!' 'Were you playing a match?' Henrik Inge asked. 'No,' I said, 'we haven’t started matches yet. It was just training.' 'Then it doesn’t count,' he said.\n[1976-06-10 20:35:00] kitchen | A few tears welled up and rolled down my cheeks. Dad stared at me with a stern, angry look. That’s when I truly began to cry. 'You can’t cry over something like this!' he said. 'You need to toughen up and endure such little things!'\n[1976-06-10 21:00:00] home | I cry easily—that's a big problem. I always cry when someone scolds me, or treats me unfairly, or even when I think they might. Dad makes me cry most often. As soon as his voice rises, I start to cry, even though I know that’s probably what he hates most. But I can’t help it. The moment he raises his voice—which he usually does—I begin to tear up. I’ve never cried because of Mom. Throughout my entire childhood, it happened only twice. Both times were during the period when I started playing football.\n[1976-06-12 20:00:00] the woods below | I went down to the woods below with a group of people. We gathered together, standing in a circle... For a long time, I just stood there listening... Then suddenly, a gap appeared—one I could step into. I heard seagulls shrieking from Yube Bay and saw that the sky still held some light, though darkness had begun creeping across the ground and beneath the trees in the lower woods.\n[1976-06-12 20:10:00] the woods below | I said, 'I’m the smartest in my class, at least in reading and writing... I learned to read when I was five—earlier than anyone else in my class... Take Edmund, for example—he’s four years older than me, but he can’t read at all!... That’s not lying, is it?'\n[1976-06-12 20:12:00] the woods below | I saw tears welling up in Edmund’s eyes. He stumbled slightly, turned around, and began walking uphill. I heard Henrik Inge say, 'Now you shut up, you show-off.' I said, 'But it’s true, isn’t it, Edmund?'\n[1976-06-12 20:15:00] the woods below / on the path | I felt him place his hand on my arm and push me aside. I heard Henrik Inge whisper to me, 'What are you doing?' I said, 'But it’s true—I’m the best in my class, and he’s the worst in his.' Henrik Inge said, 'Go home now. You’re not allowed to stay here with us.' I said, 'You can’t decide that.' He said, 'Shut up and get back!'\n[1976-06-12 20:20:00] home | I said, 'Fine, fine,' and started walking up the slope. After passing the crossroads, I dashed through the gate and took off my clothes. When I lay down in bed to read, my eyes filled with tears. I thought, what I said was true—why did he push me? It’s so unfair. I only told the truth. It’s not fair, not fair, not fair.\n[1976-06-12 21:00:00] bedroom / kitchen | I showed her the letter I had written to Grandpa... Then she gave me an envelope, I put the letter inside, and she wrote the name and address. She asked if I had been crying. I said yes. She asked why, and I said Henrik Inge pushed me. She said she would talk to him about it. She said Grandpa would be happy to receive the letter and promised to mail it the next day.\n[1976-06-12 21:30:00] bedroom | I left there and lay down on my bed. While I was reading, I heard Henrik Inge come home—his footsteps on the stairs, the sound of him entering the kitchen... Then voices, footsteps in the hallway, and the door opening. Lying there, I imagined how she would tell him he shouldn’t have pushed me, shouldn’t have blamed or scolded me. I could almost see Henrik Inge standing there with his head hanging low.\n[1976-06-12 21:35:00] bedroom | I immediately saw Mom looking angry and sat up straight. I saw her take a few steps forward, nearly right in front of me. I saw Henrik Inge standing behind her, looking at me. I heard her say, 'Is what Henrik Inge said true? Did you mock Edmund because he can’t read the text?' I nodded. 'Sort of.' She said, 'Don’t you realize Edmund would feel hurt?... Grete Lundnes, don’t you understand?' I heard Henrik Inge say, 'He cried—you made him cry. Do you understand that?'\n[1976-06-12 21:40:00] bedroom | I began to cry—a kind of crying I’d never experienced before. I felt Mom lean over me and gently stroke my cheek with one hand. I sobbed, 'Aaaaaa, waaahhh waaahhh waaahhh.' I choked out, 'I’m sorry, Mom. I’ll never do anything like that again. Never. I swear it with my whole heart.' Suddenly, I understood completely. Mom’s words were an unflinching summary of what had happened. It was Edmund who deserved sympathy—even though he was four years older than me. He was hurt—and I had caused that hurt.\n[1976-06-12 21:50:00] bedroom | I realized I was crying out loud, those words of apology sounding more like shouts... Mom calmed down, but Henrik Inge didn't... Even though Edmund meant nothing to him... About this, I felt half-understanding, half-confusion.",

    "text": "[1976-06-15 20:00:00] on the road | I held the flashlight... I shone its beam into the dark living room window of a house we were passing. I heard Mom suddenly whisper, “Don’t do that! People live in there! You can’t shine your light into someone’s living room!”\n[1976-06-15 20:05:00] on the road | I quickly directed the light back onto the ground, desperately trying to hold back tears for a few seconds, but I completely failed—then came long sobs and whimpers. I heard Mom say, “Is it really that upsetting? If you see something, you have to speak up, understand? What you did wasn’t very polite.” I started crying not because I was scolded, but because it was she who scolded me. But at least she shouldn’t get angry just because I cried.\n[1976-06-16 10:00:00] residential area | I know I almost never cry outside. Of course, falling down is an exception... The fact is, no one ever comes specifically to my house looking for me, and this precisely confirms other things beyond my control. I often argue with others, especially Toya Moen... Yet everyone still prefers playing with him rather than with me.\n[1976-06-16 14:00:00] residential area | I follow Dalson, Karl Larsdal follows me, and Vemund follows Karl Larsdal. I saw his reluctance in his movements, and soon he disappeared. I said, “I’m supposed to command him! I decide what we do.” Karl Larsdal said, “But you can’t decide what I do.” I said, “What does that matter? Didn’t I just say Dalson commands me? You command Vemund? So what if I command you?”\n[1976-06-18 15:00:00] roadside | A huge truck drove past, its trailer loaded with stones blasted and removed from farther up the mountain. I said, “You see? It’s a Mercedes!” I’m not interested in cars, boats, or motorcycles—I know nothing about them—but since everyone else likes them, I feel I must do something, just to show that I also know my way around.\n[1976-06-18 15:05:00] roadside | Karl Larsdal said, “It isn’t. Mercedes doesn’t make trucks.” I said, “Well, didn’t you see the star?” He said, “Have you gone completely crazy or what? That’s not a Mercedes star.” I said, “Yes, it is.” Karl Larsdal whistled. He said, “Besides, Mercedes does make trucks. I’ve read it. It’s written in one of my books.” I saw Karlsen’s chubby face instantly grow even fatter than usual.\n[1976-06-18 15:10:00] roadside | Karlsen said, “I’d really like to see that book—you lie so easily. You don’t know anything about trucks.” I said, “Can you just talk like that because your dad works with construction machinery?” He said, “Yes, actually, that’s exactly why.” I said, “Oh yeah? Then you think you know all about slalom skiing too... Look at how clumsy you are on skis. What good would another pair of ski gear do for you?... Everyone says you’re spoiled.” He said, “I’m not spoiled—you’re just jealous.”\n[1976-06-18 15:15:00] roadside | I saw that Karlsen now not only turned his face away from me but turned his whole body away as well. I said, “Why should I be jealous of you?” Viktor Lunddal said, “Just drop it, Grete Lundnes.” I said, “Why should I drop it instead of Karlsen?” Viktor Lunddal said, “Because Karlsen is right—the truck isn’t a Mercedes. And it’s not only him who has slalom skis. I have them too.”\n[1976-06-18 15:20:00] roadside | I said, “It’s only because your dad died—that’s why your mom buys you everything.” Viktor Lunddal said, “No, it’s because she wants to buy things for me.” I said, “Your mom works in a store—that doesn’t pay much.” Toya Moen said, “Then do teachers earn more money? Do you think we haven’t seen your house walls? They’re full of cracks, about to collapse because your dad didn’t know he needed steel reinforcement. He used only cement to plaster! What a blockhead!”\n[1976-06-18 15:25:00] roadside | Then they all ran off. Viktor Lunddal said, \"He thinks he's someone special just because he's on the city council. When he drove past, he raised one finger to greet us. So now you just shut your mouth.\" I said, \"Why should I shut up?\" He said, \"No, right—you don't have to shut up... Anyway, we're not playing with you anymore.\"\n[1976-06-18 18:00:00] residential area | I find myself increasingly often suddenly feeling cornered... When I arrive, the others turn away... Yes, sometimes I realize they are avoiding me... They say about me that I always know the most, that I'm always boasting. But the truth is, I do know more—much more than anyone else. Should I pretend not to know, like everyone else? When I know something, then I know it—because that's simply how things are.\n[1976-06-18 19:00:00] ball field | I think everyone boasts—that's just what people do... So the problem isn't what I've done, but who I am. Otherwise, why would Helen Ster start calling me 'professional player' when I was just kicking a ball around?... All I did was explain how football should be played... We shouldn't run around in a swarm; we should spread out around the ball, or dribble past opponents instead of crowding together in chaos.\n[1976-06-20 10:00:00] school | That spring, I also got the final important role. At the time, since the spring semester was ending and preparations were underway for the year-end celebration, the school rearranged class schedules, and the teacher handed out scripts for the play. Who else but me could possibly get this lead role?... It was me. Me, me, me. None of them could memorize so many lines... But in the end, the teacher chose me—it wasn't by chance.\n[1976-06-25 14:00:00] school auditorium | During the final week, we practiced every day... The last day finally arrived, and all the parents came. I saw them dressed in their finest clothes, sitting on chairs along the wall, taking photos with their cameras. When we delivered our lines passionately, the audience fell completely silent, and at the end of the performance, thunderous applause filled the room. I saw the sun shining gloriously. When she gave me the role, I was so happy I didn’t know what to do—I felt almost flustered... Every day, I was the center of attention in class, and the person Ingeborg Lofnes focused on.\n[1976-06-25 15:00:00] school playground | We played a tape, sang songs, then received our report cards... Then we ran out onto the playground and down further to where all the cars were parked, waiting for us. I stood somewhat impatiently beside Karl Larsdal by my mother’s Volkswagen Beetle, waiting for her. She walked over with Marta, both laughing and talking, not noticing Karl Larsdal and me until they were only a few meters away.\n[1976-06-25 15:10:00] by the car | I saw my mother standing there for a long time, searching through her handbag for the car keys. She opened the door, and we got in—two adults in front, children in the back. Each lit a cigarette. Then we drove home into the sunlight. I heard my mother say, \"Finally found it.\" I saw my mother wearing beige pants, a rust-red sweater with sleeves rolled up below her elbows. Her hair hung long down past her back. On her feet were light brown sandals. She had just turned thirty-two. Marta wore a brown dress and was two years older than my mother.\n[1976-06-25 20:00:00] parents' bedroom | I stood in the open doorway, watching my mother dry her hair in their bedroom. Sometimes, when Dad wasn't around, I'd follow her around the house... But now I was quiet... I watched how she lowered her head... Occasionally she glanced at me and smiled. I stepped into the room. On a small table against the wall lay an envelope... I moved closer. It read \"Solvevik·Grete Lundnes\". I heard the sharp, shrill noise of the hair dryer making speech impossible. I didn't mean to snoop, but even from a distance I could see the name written there was Cecil—the name of my mother—but longer than her name... Something I knew without needing to read it.\n[1976-06-25 20:05:00] parents' bedroom | I saw her lower the hand holding the hair dryer, as if to make my voice clearer, and she looked at me. I nodded toward the envelope. She leaned forward and picked it up. She switched off the hair dryer. I said, \"Mom!\" Then I said, \"What's written on that envelope? What kind of name is that?\" She asked, \"What?\" I said, \"What's the name!\" She said, \"It's my name.\" I said, \"But it says Norunn! You're not called Norunn!\" She said, \"Yes I am. That's my middle name. Solvevik.\" I said, \"Have you always been called that?\" She said, \"Ye-es. I've been called that my whole life. Didn't you know?\" I said, \"No! Why have you never told me?\" I thought, Norunn? Who is that? I felt my chest tighten with disappointment.\n[1976-06-25 20:10:00] parents' bedroom | Tears ran down my cheeks. Mom said, \"My dear sweet child, I don't think it matters? Cecil—that's the name I use. Norunn is just a middle name. An extra added name.\" A tremor passed through me. It wasn't really about the name itself, but that I had known nothing about it. My mother has things I don't know about. Are there even more things I don't know?",

    "text": "[1976-07-15 06:00:00] home | We drove to Sør-Aurdal in the outer Sogn region, to Sørbygda... The car’s trunk was packed full, Mom and Dad sat in front, Henrik Inge and I in the back seat. I had been longing for this day of departure so intensely that I woke up at first light, dazed and wrapped in a sense of unreality... Still, I sensed the difference. Now this journey no longer belonged to our house... Now it belonged to the long expedition we had begun, and I looked forward with anticipation to every cliff and crag, every island and reef.\n[1976-07-15 07:00:00] intersection by the bridge | When we reached the intersection by the bridge, I instinctively crossed my hands and folded them together, offering a brief prayer as I always did. I prayed: Dear God. Please, please keep us from having an accident. Amen.\n[1976-07-15 10:00:00] Setesdal Valley | We drove deep into the land, through vast, monotonous stretches of bare forest, past the long row of low military barracks at Evje and wide, sparse pine woodlands, then past Byglandsfjord and campgrounds, climbing upward through Setesdal Valley with its old farms and courtyards, and many signs advertising silversmith workshops. At some points along the road, we nearly drove onto private driveways. Gradually, the buildings disappeared, as if finally letting go of us, one after another, like children tied by ropes to a boat who fall off the big life ring one by one as the boat speeds up—until only the life ring remains.\n[1976-07-15 12:00:00] Setesdal Valley | I looked toward the bright sandbanks along both sides of the river, and saw green-covered slopes rising ever more steeply into the sky. Occasionally, a bare, massive mountain peak emerged, everything veiled in dark gray tones, yet on some summits stood pines glowing red like flames. I saw rapids and waterfalls, rivers and open fields, all bathed in intense, clear sunlight, while our car climbed higher and higher, as if ascending into the clouds. The road was narrow, following gentle, almost imperceptible undulations of the earth, winding around bends—sometimes flanked by trees like walls, other times opening up to sudden, breathtaking views.\n[1976-07-15 13:00:00] highway | \"Are we going to stop soon?\" I might ask when I spotted such rest areas... We also had a cooler in the trunk, a thermos, juice, a stack of plastic cups and plates. Dad would say: \"Don't nag.\" Occasionally along the way there were places where we could pull over to eat—small gravel lots by the roadside where families could sit at rough wooden tables, park their cars nearby, open trunks and doors as widely as possible, usually in the shade of trees and often close to lakes or rivers. Everyone placed their thermoses on the table; many brought coolers, some even portable gas stoves. Because stopping to eat and taking ferries were both highlights of the journey. He was always busy calculating how many more kilometers we needed to drive before stopping... Then we’d have to search for just the right spot. Because the first place we saw wasn’t necessarily a good one—no; since we rarely stopped en route, when we did stop, it had to be somewhere truly special.\n[1976-07-15 14:30:00] Haugastøl Mountain | Dad drove faster along this stretch because visibility was high... Without warning, Dad turned on the turn signal, slowed down, and pulled into a rest area. When Henrik Inge saw them, he said this. Up on the mountain, the terrain became quite flat. No trees or bushes were visible. The road stretched straight ahead like a rope. Some parts were strewn with stones... Other sections consisted of clean, level, water-smoothed rock. Between them shimmered patches of water, and dazzling brightness came from snowfields. Along both sides of the road stood tall icicles—so long they were characteristic of the place, since winter snow could remain unmelted atop them year-round. These icicles were several meters long! The sun shone brightly, and the mountain plateau unfolded in every direction as we rushed past.\n[1976-07-15 14:45:00] lakeside rest stop | Dad opened the trunk, took out the cooler, and set it on a rough wooden table. Mom immediately began unpacking everything inside. Dad also brought over the bag containing cups and plates. Henrik Inge and I ran to the water’s edge, bent down, and dipped our hands into the lake. The rest stop sat directly to the right of the lake—an oval body of water, entirely black. On the opposite side, the mountains rose slightly higher, but on the lower side stood a huge snowdrift, almost blue in color, hollow beneath, where the water disappeared into an opening. Complete silence surrounded us. After so many hours accompanied by the constant roar of the engine, this silence felt false, as if it didn’t belong to the landscape but to us instead. Bone-chilling cold!\n[1976-07-15 14:50:00] lakeside rest stop | Henrik Inge and I walked over to the snowdrift. It was so hard we couldn’t shape it into snowballs as we’d imagined. We weren’t allowed to step into the icy water beneath the ice cave while Mom and Dad were watching. I scooped up a piece of snow and threw it into the water. It floated and bobbed on the surface like a tiny iceberg. Dad said: \"Kids, aren't we going for a swim here?\" I said: \"Ah, no, the water's freezing!\" He said: \"Are you all wimps?\" I said: \"But the water really is ice-cold!\" He replied: \"Alright, alright, I know. I was just joking. We don't have time to swim here.\" I thought that when we got home, at least I could say we threw snowballs in July.\n[1976-07-15 15:00:00] lakeside rest stop | Mom called out: \"Come, time to eat.\" We sat down. Each of us had our own lunchbox. At that moment, a car roared up behind me, the sound growing louder, beginning to vibrate, then fading with a rumble until it finally vanished completely. Our cups were filled with juice. The plastic gave it a different taste, but I liked it—it reminded me of our car trips to pick strawberries and of camping outings. Actually, we hadn’t taken many such trips; in fact, only once—last summer, when we traveled to Mochengdao with Grandma and Grandpa.\n[1976-07-15 15:10:00] lakeside rest stop | I saw a car towing a trailer coming from the opposite side of the road. My eyes followed them as I poured the last drop of juice from the bottle. The turn signal began flashing. As the car turned into the rest area, Dad turned around. I saw the steam rising from Mom and Dad’s coffee cups.\n[1976-07-15 15:12:00] lakeside rest stop | He pulled out a cigarette case decorated with a fox pattern from his shirt pocket. The car towing the caravan stopped just a few meters away from us. The door opened, and a fat man wearing beige shorts, a T-shirt, and a fisherman's hat stepped out. He opened the door of the caravan and disappeared inside, while at the same time a woman got out from the other side of the car. She was also fat, wearing light-blue elastic pants with pressed creases down the legs and a woolen sweater. A cigarette dangled unlit from her mouth; her hair was thick, a mix of yellow and gray, and she wore large glasses with thin black lenses over her eyes. She walked to the water’s edge and stood there, gazing ahead as she lit her cigarette. He said, \"What’s this fool doing coming here? There’s only one table, didn’t he see it?\"\n[1976-07-15 15:15:00] lakeside rest stop | I started eating my last piece of bread. I saw the man come out holding a folding camping table. He unfolded it and set it up between his car and our table. I saw Dad drink the last sip of coffee from his cup and stand up. Dad turned around again. \"Do they not understand how things are done here?\" he said. \"We’re sitting here eating. Does he just shove himself right in like that?\" \"It doesn’t matter,\" Mom said. \"This place is nice enough.\" \"It *was* nice enough,\" Dad said, \"until this fool showed up.\" \"He’ll hear you,\" Mom said. \"They’re from Oswick,\" Dad said. \"They can’t understand us. We can say whatever we want.\" \"Well, now we should get going.\"\n[1976-07-15 15:20:00] lakeside rest stop | I saw him toss away his still half-burning cigarette, pick up the coffee cup and drink cans, walk to the water, rinse them, then put them along with the plates and thermos into a bag. He closed the lid of the cooler and put everything into the car’s trunk. The man and the woman said something I couldn’t understand, looking toward the gentle slope on the far side of the water. He pointed. I saw something moving far off. Mom crumpled up the food wrapping paper, stuffed it into a bag, and stood up. \"The kids haven’t finished eating yet,\" Mom said. \"Do we really need to rush?\" \"Not really,\" Dad said. \"Well then, finish up. But hurry.\" \"Now we’re leaving,\" Mom said. \"We’ll eat the biscuits at the next break.\"\n[1976-07-15 15:25:00] inside the car | I saw Dad push the front seat forward for me, and I climbed in. Henrik Inge climbed in from the other door. He wrinkled his nose. Henrik Inge said, \"I don’t think the motion sickness pills are working.\" \"Then tell us if you feel sick,\" Mom said. \"It won’t help if you keep smoking like this,\" he said. \"Shut up, boy,\" Dad said. \"Don’t complain. We’re on vacation now.\" This was exactly what I had feared would happen. After breathing fresh air outside, the heavy smoke smell inside the car felt especially unpleasant.\n[1976-07-15 15:30:00] inside the car | The car slowly moved back onto the road. As we passed the lakeside, I looked into the distance, toward the direction the man had been pointing. I nudged Henrik Inge and pointed out the window to draw his attention outside. I said, \"What is that?\" He said, \"Maybe reindeer—we saw them last year too, don’t you remember?\" I said, \"I remember, but they were so close then. This one’s tiny, like a mouse, over there!\" There was definitely something out there. Against the green backdrop, a grayish shape was slowly moving. Who knows what it could be? Then we sank into the almost trance-like, dazed state that long car rides can bring.",

    "text": "[1976-07-15 17:00:00] Odda | We drove through... The car passed over the remaining mountains, descending into Nore village, then further into the town of Odda—a dirty little place at the very end of the Hardangerfjord, marked by decay and pollution... I realized that a person will sometimes encounter a towering peak rising abruptly before them, dominating everything with its purity and simplicity, making all other details of the landscape bow before it, vanish completely, utterly disappear... It was fundamentally, incomprehensibly different from the world we had left just hours earlier. The southern landscape was mostly made up of low rocky cliffs and scattered, uneven patches of woodland... On the island where I lived, the highest mountain was less than one hundred twenty meters tall... Who would care about a birch tree—even an unusually tall one—when standing beneath these magnificent, immovable mountains?\n[1976-07-15 18:00:00] Hardangerfjord | I noticed the colors here seemed more intense, deeper—the green nowhere as rich, dense, vivid, and luminous as in this western region—not even the sky, which here appeared bluer and clearer than the sky back where I came from. The valley sides were lush and thick with trees; in spring and early summer, fruit trees bloomed with white cherry blossoms like snow, mountain peaks veiled in hazy blue, snow gleaming everywhere. And nestled among these mountains—between the peaks rising on either side of the valley—lay a fjord, its waters deep, just as the mountains beside it were high.\n[1976-07-15 19:00:00] Hardangerfjord | Then we drove up along the northern side of the fjord... I saw that every detail was unfamiliar—the electric gate, the red barns, the old white wooden houses, cows grazing, long rows of hayracks standing upright, stretching up along both sides of the valley. Tractors, mowers, manure pits, brown rubber boots placed by the front doors, large shady trees in the yards, horses, ordinary homes with small shops run out of their basements. Children sold cherries and strawberries by the roadside, with handwritten signs on little tables. Driving through such scenery always makes a strong impression, because you can never predict, based on what you see one second, what you’ll see the next. Life here was unlike life back home: I could see an old woman bent over, wearing a dress with big flowers and a shawl—something you’d never see where we lived—or an old man, stooped and dressed in blue, wearing a black brimmed hat, standing in a field or walking along a gravel path—also unseen back home.\n[1976-07-15 19:30:00] Hardangerfjord | Place names... Tyssedal, Eidfjord, Holme, Skei, Borgund, Uppstad, Ulvik, Lofthus, Kinsarvik. Among the many impressions this place left on me, the place names formed a significant part... Their strange sounds delighted me most. 'Vik' means bay, but what does 'Kinsar' truly mean? No matter how vivid the colors, no matter how varied the details, an overwhelming sense of vastness hung over this region—not merely surrounding the people and their activities, but enveloping their entire living space, as though the space itself were too immense for them... We didn’t stop anywhere, except when Henrik Inge wandered off at a bus station to vomit. We were strangers here, knew no one, so nothing we saw had any connection to us.\n[1976-07-15 20:00:00] Kinsarvik dock | When we finally arrived at the Kinsarvik dock, Dad parked the car in line and we got out... Children carefully kicked a ball around beside the queue, or, like Henrik Inge and me, walked toward the little kiosk at the far end, wondering if we could spend some of our holiday pocket money there. By then, we no longer felt that earlier atmosphere. Quite the opposite—everything here felt pleasant, comfortable...\n[1976-07-15 20:10:00] Kinsarvik Harbor | Henrik Inge bought a boat-shaped ice cream, and I bought a barrel-shaped one, complete with a little red shovel. We held them in our hands as we slowly walked toward the dock. We sat down on the stone edge, looking at the seawater below and a thick, wet cluster of seaweed clinging to the rocks. We saw the ferry entering the harbor from far across. I smelled the air filled with saltwater, seaweed, grass blades, and exhaust fumes, and felt the sun burning hotly on our faces.\n[1976-11-01 11:30:00] Home / Basement | I know that when it comes to housework, they share responsibilities more equally than the parents of my friends; Dad takes care of cleaning and cooking. I remember hundreds of kilograms of various berries we picked along the roadside during our summer and autumn drives through the forests and fields of Leivik. I know they later turned those berries into juice and jam. I remember raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, and yellowberries—Dad would let out joyful shouts whenever he found them.\n[1976-11-01 11:40:00] Home / Swimming Spot | Everything we eat each day is planned in great detail, orderly and regulated. I know that before we go to school, we always already know how many classes there will be and what subjects they are. Evening activities follow a routine too: when it snows or freezes, yes, that means skiing and skating. And when the underwater temperature rises to fifteen degrees, yes, that’s when we go swimming—rain or shine, no exceptions.\n[1976-11-01 11:50:00] Home | I listen to his footsteps on the stairs. I feel that the only truly unpredictable thing in life—from autumn to winter, spring to summer, one school year to the next—is Dad. I am so afraid of him... I’ve never once felt close to him. Is he on his way here now? I look at the savagery in his eyes. The drooping mouth, the unconscious parting of his lips. And his voice. Sitting here, listening with the ear of my mind, I almost begin to cry.\n[1976-11-01 12:00:00] Home | I feel his anger like a tidal wave sweeping through the entire room, crashing against me, striking, striking again, then receding. I know it might subside for weeks afterward. But that’s not certain… Suddenly, he could erupt in rage again. I realize whether or not he hits me doesn’t really matter… It’s not the physical pain I fear, but him… the fury he unleashes—that’s what I’m afraid of. This fear I can never escape; it’s deeply embedded throughout my childhood, woven into every single day of my life.\n[1976-11-01 12:10:00] Home | After these confrontations, I think about dying. Death is the most beautiful, most pleasant fantasy I’ve ever had. I imagine it would serve him perfectly well. Then he could stand there and reflect on what he’s done. He’d regret it bitterly. Oh, how much he’d regret! I see him standing before my small coffin—I lying inside, with my protruding buckteeth, unable to pronounce the letter 'r' anymore—clutching his hands in confusion, gazing up at the sky. How sweet this image feels to me! It almost lifts my spirits again.\n[1976-11-10 17:00:00] Old Tibakken | When the others gathered together, preparing to sneak down to Old Tibakken to steal apples… I went with them, stopped by the fence, watched them slip into the orchard in the twilight, walked beside them on the way back, their jackets bulging with apples. If anyone offered me some apples, I always refused. I begged them not to do it, telling them stealing was wrong… I said to each of them, one by one, that picking apples by theft was wrong, that they should think it over, that they didn’t need to do this. I know stealing is wrong… I understand the difference between group behavior and individual conscience… Accepting stolen goods isn’t much better than stealing itself. But I didn’t want to be alone.\n[1976-11-15 16:00:00] Outdoors | When As Karl Larsdal said something mocking to me and a girl I liked… I lunged at him, but he easily pinned me to the ground, straddling me with his legs, poking his index finger repeatedly at my chest and face… I tried spitting candy at him... I often think about this—when I’m alone, I imagine one day becoming someone important, returning home in glory. I hope to become a great person, so that everyone in Tibakken—whether they like it or not—will have to admire me. I know that day won’t come soon.\n[1976-11-15 16:10:00] Outdoors | I lay on the ground, defeated by him, powerless. I told him, 'You stink of piss, you’re a piece of shit.' I pointed out his disgusting looks, trying to turn the people standing around against him. I thought it wasn’t just that—he also had two rows of overlapping teeth… But it had no effect… The ideals and beliefs I gained from reading can’t carry me any further… Yet I can’t do it—I’m weak, slow, and cowardly; I’m not strong, agile, or brave. I’m different from other kids… But what good does that do me?… Especially me, who has read so many heroic tales, yet am so cowardly—it’s so unfair.",

    "text": "[1976-12-15 08:00:00] Rånhaug Supermarket Bus Stop | Just sticking your head outside… walking up to the Rånhaug supermarket to wait for the bus was one such thing… Our group would gather there, chatting, roughhousing, chasing girls, kicking at them, yanking off their hats, or simply tossing them into snowbanks… I wrapped my arms tightly around their waists as tightly as I could… I saw everything shimmer faintly in the damp mist, boots soaked by melting slush from the road, the white snow in the woods compacted and sinking. I felt one of them pressed close to me… Maybe it was Marianne’s, maybe Siv’s, maybe Mariann’s—because I always preferred them, thought of them more often. At those moments, all my nerves trembled, waves of pleasure rising in my chest—why is that?\n[1976-12-15 08:15:00] bus | I heard the bus clanking and rattling toward me, its tires chained. I saw the fog rising on the windows after we got on... I heard our shrieks and shouts. I think it was because of the wet snow. The damp coats. So many lovely, wonderful girls... It was because Ingeborg Lofnes was there, equally joyful, equally beautiful... Every day was a celebration, everything that happened was thrilling, nothing could be predicted.\n[1976-12-15 10:00:00] school / playing field | We hung our wet clothes on hooks and tiptoed into class in our socks... We waited impatiently for break time, then ran up the stairs, down the hallways, down the outdoor steps to the schoolyard, climbed down from the cliff edge, and reached the playing field. I saw our cheeks were flushed, our hair messy, the ends sticking out from under our hats damp with moisture. I felt that the arrival of the bus wasn't the end of everything—it was just the beginning—because the day at school lay ahead of us, and we would live through all its changes.\n[1976-12-15 16:00:00] Ubekilen | Going home, listening to music, reading, maybe fastening the skis to my feet and gliding down the steep hillside all the way to Ubekilen, where others always gathered... Skating outward, then climbing back up in a herringbone step, skating out again... Then leaning forward, tucking our ski poles under our arms, and chatting about anything under the sun. Until it grew so dark we could no longer see our own hands. I felt all of this happening with an intensity that exists only in childhood.\n[1976-12-15 17:00:00] Ubekilen | I glanced at the narrow, frozen bay. I saw the water covered by a centimeter-thick layer of ice. The lights from the houses in the housing area formed a kind of dome, illuminating the trees above us. Darkness amplified every sound—the rustle as someone shifted position, the creak of blue skis bumping underfoot, or the crunch of boots pressing into soft snow—all magnified. A car came up the narrow gravel road, a Volkswagen Beetle... Its headlights swept across the ground, revealing ghostly shapes for an instant before darkness closed over everything once more.\n[1976-12-15 18:00:00] front yard | That evening, Tore and I half-ran, half-slid down the slope... When I entered the dark stretch of road outside my house, I let myself fall onto the snow, lying on my back, gazing up at the thick, damp, utterly lightless blackness. From the glistening surface, I could tell the snowplow had just passed. I felt that such long, fleeting moments—each one compressing memories of equal intensity and richness—made up my childhood. Some of these memories could lift me to dizzying heights... a happiness beyond compare.\n[1976-12-20 15:00:00] home | I took the snow shovel and walked side by side with Karl Larsdal, who was pushing his family’s green snow cart. I tried to convince Karl Larsdal to come help an old man clear the snow from his driveway. I hinted that the old man would surely give us some money for helping him—that’s what finally made him agree. Winter had arrived, and during snowy days, I would help elderly people shovel snow... Dad had just bought a new shovel, called the 'Southern Shovel,' bright red and beautiful. He’d already cleared our driveway that morning, so I figured he wouldn’t need it again that day.\n[1976-12-20 15:30:00] Old Tibakken | We pressed the doorbell... We used the snow cart to clear a path so we could shovel the snow aside into the ditch, where we dumped it... The gray sky hung heavy and low; the snow was so wet... From the offshore lighthouse, the foghorn sounded. Children passed by on small sleds or skis, cars crawled up the hill like a net... It was hard work, but also full of fun.\n[1976-12-20 16:30:00] Old Tibakken | We spent an hour clearing the driveway of snow. When we went up to tell the old man, he thanked us and then closed the door. I saw Karl Larsdal glaring at me accusingly.\n[1976-12-20 16:35:00] Old Tibakken | \"Aren’t we going to get any money?\" \"Well… yes. Actually, we should have gotten paid. But it’s not my fault he didn’t give us anything…\" \"So we did all that work for nothing?\" \"Looks like it,\" I said, \"but it’s no big deal. Come on, let’s go.\"\n[1976-12-20 16:50:00] driveway at home | He followed behind me, grumbling. When we reached the road in front of our house, I saw Dad standing in the doorway. My heart seemed to stop. A spasm in my stomach made it almost impossible to breathe. I saw his eyes were furious.\n[1976-12-20 16:55:00] driveway at home | When I hesitated walking up the driveway... during those final steps, my eyes were fixed on the ground. I looked up. He slapped me across the face. I gasped. \"Now you get over here!\" he roared. \"Look at me!\" he said.\n[1976-12-20 17:00:00] front door at home | He grabbed the lapel of my down jacket and slammed me against the wall... I was crying and gasping for breath... Then he yanked me again, shoved me through the door, and threw me hard against the opposite wall. \"You took my snow shovel!\" he shouted. \"It was brand new! It's mine! My things have nothing to do with you! Do you understand? Taking it without asking! I thought it had been stolen!\" ... \"Don't you ever do that again! Never! Go back up to your room and stay there until I call you down! Understand?\" I barely heard what he was saying.\n[1976-12-20 17:05:00] bedroom | He slammed his office door shut. I began taking off my clothes. My hands were trembling. \"Yes, Dad,\" I said.\n[1976-12-20 17:10:00] bedroom | I pulled off my gloves and hat, twisted out of my boots, then took off my down jacket and thick sweater. I went up to my room and lay down on the bed. I sobbed, tears streaming onto the pillow. A fire surged through me. At the same time, a wave of anger welled up inside, twisting and tearing at my heart, and I didn’t know what to do with it. I hated him, and I needed to get back at him. I would take revenge. Let him see. I would crush him. Destroy him.\n[1976-12-20 17:15:00] bedroom | Then a thought flashed through my mind: What would a good child do? What would a true Christian do? Forgive. That’s what. As I thought this, a warmth spread from the center of my heart. I would forgive him. It was a noble idea. It made me feel like a noble person.\n[1977-01-15 18:00:00] at home | Buttered bread slices laid out on the dining table, lunch packed in the fridge, returning home to shop, sitting there while he cooked dinner, answering his questions... occasionally he’d poke me in the back with a small knife... then dinner, and the rest of the evening spent upstairs with Henrik Inge... once a week after school, we’d go shopping at Storgata. In the evenings, sometimes he’d come upstairs to watch TV with us. We ignored him, sitting stiff-backed, motionless and silent. If he asked anything, we answered in one or two words. He would occasionally interject, \"Sit up straight, boy.\" In the year that followed, every other day repeated the pattern of that first day I spent alone with Dad, following the same routine. But that was only when I was by myself. When I was in the same room with him, he seemed to devour all the goodness within me—he became the only presence, and I couldn’t think of anything else.",

    "text": "[1977-03-10 20:00:00] bedroom | If I was listening to music, I turned it down. If I was lying in bed reading, I sat up immediately... The door opened, and there he stood. His eyes swept around my room. They stopped at the desk. Footsteps on the stairs. Gradually, he shifted his attention away from Henrik Inge and began spending more and more time with me, because I never dared to show the same cold resistance as Henrik Inge did. But not always. Footsteps on the stairs—ominous. It didn’t seem casual anymore. Was he coming here? Definitely.\n[1977-03-10 20:05:00] bedroom | He walked into the room holding a deck of cards... I put my book down. He sat down on the bed... lifted the deck high and flung all the cards across the floor, scattering them everywhere. \"What are you doing there?\" he said... \"Shall we play cards?\" \"Okay, let's play cards,\" I said... \"I'll teach you a new game,\" he said... \"It's called '52 Pickup,'\" he said. \"Go on—pick them up!\"\n[1977-03-10 20:10:00] bedroom | I had to kneel on the floor picking up each card one by one, while he sat on the edge of the bed laughing at me. \"You bastard!\" I said. \"Why did you do that?\" I had thought he really wanted to play cards, but he was just messing with me... I felt utterly disappointed, and the words slipped out before I could stop them. If I had thought, I would never have said such a thing. But I didn’t—and they just spilled out.\n[1977-03-10 20:12:00] bedroom | He froze. Then he grabbed my ear and yanked me to my feet, twisting his hand... he twisted harder and tighter until I cried out... still gripping my ear, I bent down and picked up the cards one by one. \"How dare you insult your father?\" he said... \"Now pick up every single card, boy!\" he said.\n[1977-03-10 20:20:00] bedroom / kitchen | I picked up all the cards, then let go and walked out of the room. By the time we went into the kitchen for evening snacks, he was still sitting in the office downstairs, but he had already prepared the food for us.\n[1977-03-14 18:00:00] dining room / office | After the meal was ready, he called us from inside. We sat down and ate in silence... After finishing, I said 'thank you for dinner' and left the table. After Dad washed the dishes and tidied up, he ate oranges in the living room... He also drank a cup of coffee... Then he went down to the office, listened to some music, put on his coat, walked to the car, got in, and drove away. I caught a scent in the air... I could hear the bubbling sound of water in the coffee pot.\n[1977-03-14 18:20:00] living room / kitchen | When the sound of the car faded away down the hill, I opened the front door and walked into the living room. I plopped down on the brown leather sofa and propped my feet up on the table. I stood up, went into the kitchen, opened the refrigerator door and looked inside: there were two large plates of buttered bread slices... I opened the nearby cabinet, took out a box of raisins, poured a handful into my mouth, and with my other hand smoothed down the remaining raisins in the box. Chewing as I walked, I returned to the living room and turned on the TV. The show 'The Intruder' is being rebroadcast at six-thirty. It's a sci-fi TV series, quite terrifying. Actually, the show airs on Friday nights, which we're not allowed to watch, but neither Mom nor Dad knows about the rerun, and luckily, they're both out right now.\n[1977-03-14 18:25:00] living room | Henrik Inge came in and lay down on the sofa... He stood up... He opened the inner cabinet. \"What are you eating?\" he said. \"Raisins,\" I said. \"I want some too,\" he said. \"Don't take too much,\" I said, \"Dad will notice.\" \"He won't,\" Henrik Inge said. \"Do you want some almonds?\" he called out. \"Okay,\" I said, \"but don't take too much.\"\n[1977-03-14 18:26:00] living room | The streetlights outside cast an almost orange glow in the darkness. The road beneath the halo shines the same color. Sparse pine trees stand behind, but beyond them the woods are as dark and deep as a tomb. From the steepest part of the hill comes the strained growl of a motorcycle engine. I feel that the woods are as dark and deep as a tomb.\n[1977-03-14 18:27:00] living room | He loosened his grip and poured some almonds into my open palm. \"Here you go,\" Henrik Inge said. I easily recognized his scent—strong but not sharp, slightly metallic. Not the smell of sweat, but another kind, coming from his skin. A metallic smell. I could smell it when we wrestled, when he tickled me under the arms, and sometimes when he lay reading, I would lie close beside his arm just to breathe it in deeply. I love him, I love Henrik Inge.\n[1977-03-14 18:28:00] living room | Henrik Inge stood up... I stood up and blocked his way. He wrapped his arms around me, lifted me up, set me behind him, and continued toward the stairs. \"Let's shut the front door and turn off all the lights,\" he said, \"it'll be scarier that way.\" \"No!\" I said, \"Don't turn off the lights!\" Henrik Inge laughed. \"You're already scared?\" ... \"Don't!\" I said, \"please!\" Five minutes before 'The Intruder' begins.\n[1977-03-14 18:29:00] stairs / doorway | I ran after him... He closed the door and stood in front of me again... He turned off the light. \"I'm going down to shut the door,\" he answered from the stairs. \"I'm serious, Henrik Inge,\" I said. \"I know you are,\" he said... \"But when we're alone at home, I'm the one who decides.\"\n[1977-03-14 18:30:00] living room | I ran up the stairs and sat down in the chair. I listened as he turned off each light—one by one. The hall light, the lamp on the living room table, the ceiling light in the kitchen. Then the four wall lamps above the sofa, and finally the lamp on top of the television. In the half-light, his smiling face is illuminated by the glow from the adjacent room, giving him a somewhat devilish look... When the show starts, the room is completely dark except for the faint light from the streetlamp outside and the flickering blue glow from the TV screen.\n[1977-03-14 19:00:00] living room | The film started off frightening—a man standing somewhere waving a large scythe, then he turns around, and instead of a face, there's only a mask... Henrik Inge stood up behind me... He spoke and moved toward me. \"Don't talk,\" I begged him, \"don't do anything!\" \"You know, Grete Lundnes?\" he said. \"Ah, no!\" I said. \"I'm not what you think,\" he said. \"You are!\" I said. I am gripped by deep fear, but I keep watching—I have to watch.\n[1977-03-14 19:05:00] living room | He stretched out his arms forward and pulled off the sweater... \"I'm not Henrik Inge,\" he said, \"I'm someone else.\" \"You're not someone else!\" I said, \"You are Henrik Inge! Say you are Henrik Inge!\" \"I'm a robot,\" he said, \"This here—this isn't flesh and blood. It's metal and wiring. It looks like muscle and blood, but it isn't. I'm not a living person.\" \"You are!\" I cried, starting to sob, \"You are Henrik Inge! Henrik Inge! Say you are Henrik Inge!\"\n[1977-03-14 19:10:00] living room | He looked at me with a grin... He took a step toward me. \"Now you'll follow me down into the cellar,\" he said, \"Ha ha ha...\" \"Henrik Inge!\" I shouted. \"I was just joking,\" he said, \"You don't actually think I'm a robot, do you?\" \"Don't do this,\" I said, \"Turn the lights on right now.\" \"No!\" I screamed.\n[1977-03-14 19:15:00] living room / kitchen | He turned on the wall lamp and switched on the light above the television; the evening news had already started. We went into the kitchen for a snack. Henrik Inge made tea for us... \"OK, OK,\" he said, smiling, \"We'll turn on the lights. Or maybe we should eat first? Are you hungry?\" \"Turn the lights on first,\" I said. As long as we clean everything up afterward, we'll be safe—Dad won't find out we used the electric stove to boil water.\n[1977-03-14 20:00:00] living room | Then we brought the football game over to the table in the living room, leaving his bedroom door open... We heard the sound of Dad's car and quickly tidied everything up, rushing back to our own rooms... He walked straight into the living room and sat down in front of the television. Inside was playing my favorite album by Queen, 'A Night at the Opera.' Usually when we were home alone, he would call Henrik Inge over and ask what we'd been doing, whether everything was going well.",

    "text": "[1977-04-10 14:00:00] Sørbøvåg / outdoors | I kept begging him again and again not to swear. I remember one afternoon when he came with me to visit my grandparents, he still ignored my advice... On the bus, I gave up my seat for the elderly; when they left the store, I helped them carry their bags; I never hung onto the back of cars, never damaged public property, never shot birds with a slingshot, and while walking I always watched the ground so I wouldn't step on ants or beetles... I kept begging him again and again not to swear... I've asked him countless times to stop using foul language. During Easter, when we visited my grandparents in Sørbøvåg, I made a new friend. How worried I was... Afterward, he always avoided me, and I comforted myself with the thought that I had done the right thing... Even when in spring I picked flowers with Karl Larsdal or others to give to Mom or Dad, the thought that I had ended those flowers' lives made my heart sink steadily.\n[1977-04-10 19:00:00] at home | He avoided us like this, which made us feel relieved—but not entirely. I sensed that he didn't want to act this way; it seemed as though the air in the house grew heavier because of this feeling, and no one could change it.\n[1977-04-15 19:00:00] kitchen | She said this while we were sitting there eating dinner. \"The school is in Bærum,\" she said, \"Just for one year. I'll come home every Friday and stay through the whole weekend. Then I go back Monday morning. Three days here, four days there.\" Mom told us she would start school next year. Other memories seem to leave vast blank spaces in me, like that one night.\n[1977-04-15 19:05:00] kitchen | \"So we'll be staying alone with Dad?\" Henrik Inge said. \"Yes. Everything will be fine. This way you'll get to spend more time together.\" \"Why do you have to go to school?\" I said, \"You're an adult, aren't you?\" \"There's a kind of study we call further education,\" she said, \"I need to learn more about my work. It's very exciting, you understand.\"\n[1977-04-15 19:10:00] kitchen | \"I don't want you to go,\" I said. \"Only for a year,\" she said, \"Three days a week I'll be here. And all holidays. I'll have long breaks.\" \"Still, I don't want you to go,\" I said. \"I understand,\" Mom said, \"But everything will be fine. Dad wants to be with you. Next year we'll switch. Then Dad will go for further education, and I'll stay home.\"\n[1977-04-15 19:20:00] kitchen | I drank the last sip of tea, closed my mouth, and sipped slowly... Half-rising, I lifted the heavy teapot with both hands to the edge of my cup, poured in the water, then set the pot back down... I added enough milk and three large spoons of sugar. \"Sugar in the tea,\" Henrik Inge said. \"What?\" I said. That way, none of the many dark, water-soaked tea leaves would get into my mouth. The tea was almost completely black, having steeped for a long time, and the flavor was strong.\n[1977-04-15 19:25:00] kitchen | But Henrik Inge didn't have such concerns at all; he got up and slipped out. Dad's dark figure passed by me. He turned on the TV and sat down in the chair. \"Don't you want some evening snack?\" Mom said. \"No,\" he said. Just then, I heard Dad's footsteps on the stairs. Ah, I've already filled my teacup! That means I'll have to sit here until I've drunk every last drop.\n[1977-04-15 19:30:00] kitchen | I added more milk to my cup to cool the tea down, and drank it all in four long gulps. \"Thank you for dinner!\" I said. \"You're welcome,\" Mom said.\n[1977-04-20 19:00:00] Henrik Inge's room | I was sitting on Henrik Inge's bed, leaning against the wall, reading one of his magazines. The door swung open, and I saw Dad standing there looking at us. His next visit upstairs would turn out to be as stormy and terrible as ever.\n[1977-04-20 19:05:00] Henrik Inge's room | \"You're listening to music,\" he said, \"sounds good. What's it called?\" \"New City Rats,\" said Henrik Inge. Dad repeated the name in Leivik, then said, \"Do you remember when I said Crystal Palace meant a palace made of crystal, and you laughed? You didn't believe me!\" I saw he was in a good mood, his eyes unusually bright.\n[1977-04-20 19:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw him walk into the room with a smile. He took my hand and started pulling me around in circles. \"You like this music too, Grete Lundnes?\" I nodded. \"Come on, let's dance,\" he said. \"I'm sick, Dad. I think I have a fever. I can't dance.\" \"It's okay,\" Dad said.\n[1977-04-20 19:15:00] Henrik Inge's room | But he kept dancing, spinning me faster and faster, more wildly. Just as suddenly as he had begun, he stopped, threw me onto the bed, and walked out. \"Stop, Dad!\" I said. \"I'm sick! I can't take it!\" ... \"Stop dancing, Dad!\" Finally I shouted, \"Stop it!\" I couldn't bear it anymore—I almost threw up.\n[1977-05-01 10:00:00] at home | Every Friday when Mom came home, I always stayed close by so I could reach her first. After Mom left on Sunday night or Monday morning, Dad seemed to grow closer to us again—or at least to me—because he’d call me into the kitchen to report on what happened at school while he prepared dinner. We’d eat in silence, and after cleaning up, he’d without fail go back down to his office. I thought that if I reached her first, Dad couldn’t send me back to my room; otherwise, if they were already sitting and chatting, he would do just that.\n[1977-05-15 20:00:00] at home | Sometimes he'd come up and watch TV with us... I read Agatha Christie, Stendhal’s The Red and the Black, a collection of French short stories, a book by Annievik (Jon Michelet), and a biography of Tolstoy. But more often than not, he stayed downstairs until snack time, leaving Henrik Inge and me practically alone in the house. The way I passed the time when he was home wasn’t much different from when he was away. Most of the time, I lay in bed reading. Mom could no longer regularly drive us to the library, and I had already read every book in the school library, so I began reading books from Mom’s and Dad’s shelves.\n[1977-08-15 10:00:00] at home | Now it's April—she won't start school until August. Four months... Mom going back to school felt like part of the distant future, similar to starting high school, or turning fifteen, or eighteen—it all still seemed far away. We were in the middle of childhood, a time when time itself has no meaning. The news was shocking, but once I walked into the room, I no longer felt afraid. In childhood, four months is eternity. Fleeting moments rush by in a frenzy, while the days containing them slip forward almost unnoticed.\n[1977-08-15 14:00:00] Mom's bedroom | Only when she began slowly packing her clothes in her bedroom did I finally understand. Even on the day term ended, we would no longer be third graders... The next day school would begin again, and we’d be fourth graders—definitely the oldest students in the school. We’d have a new classroom, and more importantly, a new homeroom teacher. A new backpack sat in my room, and new clothes hung in my closet. I hadn't realized she would soon leave home. All these new things made me feel giddily happy inside, and though seeing her pack still made me a bit sad, not much more than I usually felt when watching her head off to work.\n[1977-08-15 14:10:00] Mom's bedroom | She put down what she was holding and stopped packing, then looked over at me. I nodded and did as she said. \"I'll be back on Thursday,\" she said, \"just four days away.\" \"I know,\" I said, \"Did you bring everything?\" \"I think I did,\" she said, \"Would you come help me with this suitcase? Kneel on it so I can close the lid properly.\"\n[1977-08-15 14:20:00] Mom's bedroom / stairs | Dad walked up the stairs. Mom gave me a hug, then followed him downstairs. \"Now, are you ready?\" he said, nodding toward the suitcase. \"I'll take it.\"",

The car started moving backward up the hill, shifted gears, and then drove off downhill in its usual way, disappearing from sight. It felt just like any other afternoon when she went to work, yes—except for the suitcase in the trunk.\n[1977-08-15 18:00:00] home / dining room | Forks and knives clinked against plates, elbows moved, heads sat upright, spines remained straight. No one said a word. What will happen now? What will life be like? It was Mom who held us together. She was the center of Henrik Inge’s and my life—we knew it, Dad knew it, but perhaps she herself didn’t. Otherwise, how could she just leave like this? There we were, three of us: father and two sons, sitting down to dinner. Around us stretched the scenery of the 1970s.\n[1977-08-15 18:10:00] home / dining room | The silence grew heavier. All three of us noticed it. Silence isn't something that simply fades away—it stays, all the way to the end. Of course, people in silence can still speak, they can open their mouths and talk, but that doesn't break the silence.\n[1977-08-15 18:15:00] home / dining room | Dad placed the bones onto the plate with potato peels and took another beef patty. Henrik Inge and I each had only one. Henrik Inge finished eating. \"Thank you for dinner,\" he said.\n[1977-08-15 18:20:00] home / dining room | When Henrik Inge stood up, Dad looked at me as if Henrik Inge didn't even exist. \"There's dessert still.\" Dad said. \"I won't have any,\" Henrik Inge said, \"but thanks.\" \"Why don't you want any?\" Dad said. \"Pineapple and cream. You like that.\" \"Because it gives me acne,\" Henrik Inge said. \"I see,\" Dad said. \"Then you may leave the table.\"\n[1977-08-15 18:25:00] home / dining room | \"But you'll have some, Grete Lundnes?\" \"Yes, I'd love to,\" I said, \"It's the best thing I know.\" \"Good,\" he said.\n[1977-08-15 18:30:00] home / dining room | I sat there looking out the window, waiting for him to finish eating. I heard music coming from Henrik Inge's room. A group of young people had gathered outside on the road, placing two stones on the ground as goalposts. Then I heard the heavy thud of their feet kicking the loose ball; they always let out muffled cheers whenever they played football, no matter what happened.\n[1977-08-15 18:40:00] home / dining room | Finally, Dad stood up, picked up his plate, scraped the leftovers into the trash, placed the dish with pineapple and cream in front of me, and set another portion in front of himself. We ate dessert in silence.\n[1977-08-15 18:50:00] Home / Dining Room | I stood up. Dad didn't say anything; he also got to his feet, poured water into the coffee pot, and took a bag of coffee from the cupboard. Then he turned around. I stayed where I was, waiting to see if he had anything more to say. \"Thanks for dinner.\" ... \"Hey?\" he said. \"What is it?\" I said. \"You're not to make fun of Henrik Inge's acne. Understand? I never want to hear a single word about it.\" \"Okay,\" I said.\n[1977-08-15 19:00:00] Henrik Inge's Room | Dad turned away and cut open a corner of the coffee bag. I went into Henrik Inge's room. He was sitting there playing his electric guitar... He was sitting there playing, with his face full of pimples. A black Les Paul copy. I was so surprised when I first heard it, because I was certain it was the sound of a guitar with an amplifier. But it had no amplifier—just a low thumping sound.\n[1977-08-15 19:10:00] Henrik Inge's Room | \"Let's play something.\" \"I am playing,\" he said. \"Play something, you idiot,\" I said. \"Fifty-two cards, pick 'em up?\" he said. \"Ha—ha,\" I said. \"Puns only work once. I've already used that one. Can't you teach me a guitar chord?\" \"Not now. Next time.\" \"Please.\" \"Well, just one,\" he said. \"Sit here.\"\n[1977-08-15 19:20:00] Henrik Inge's Room | I sat down beside him. He placed the guitar on my knees, put three fingers on the fretboard. I placed my fingers where his had been. I strummed, but only some strings made a sound. \"This is E,\" he said, pulling his hand back. \"Alright,\" he said, \"now you start playing.\" ... \"You have to press harder,\" he said, \"and make sure your other fingers don't touch the open strings.\" \"OK,\" I said, trying again. \"Not bad,\" he said. \"That's right. Now you know the E chord.\"\n[1977-08-15 19:30:00] Henrik Inge's Room | I handed the guitar back to him and stood up. \"So, do you remember which strings are tuned to what?\" \"EADGBE,\" I said. \"Correct,\" he said, \"Now you just need a band.\" \"But I'll have to borrow your guitar,\" I said. \"No way.\" ... \"What time do you start school tomorrow anyway?\" ... \"First period,\" he said. \"You?\" \"Not first period—around eleven, I think.\" \"You think?\" \"No, I know. What about Dad?\" \"First period, absolutely.\" I stayed silent, because things could change quickly.\n[1977-08-15 20:00:00] Bedroom | I turned and walked back to my own room. That blue, square backpack I'd used for many years... Now my new backpack was dark green, made of synthetic leather, smelling like the sky. That was good news. Then I could be home alone for a few hours. The new backpack was placed near the desk. It felt a bit small for me, a little childish.\n[1977-08-15 20:30:00] Bedroom | I sniffed it for a while. Then I put on 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' lay down on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. I waved one hand in the air. My head bobbed back and forth... I sang. Bertel, Bertel, Bertel! Getting so much better all the time! It's getting better all the time! Better, better, better! It's getting better all the time! Better, better, better! Getting so much better all the time! The music made me feel slightly dizzy, filled with joy. Bertel, Bertel, Bertel!\n[1977-08-16 08:30:00] School | When we got out of the car... We wandered around, spitting or leaning against the wall of the awning, talking about how we'd spent the summer. Having three cows on a farm was no longer impressive enough to brag about... But at least I had something to say... I said, even if it wasn't as enviable as going to Liseberg in Gothenburg—the biggest amusement park in Scandinavia—it was still better than having nothing to tell. There stood the school, its building painted black, many windows flickering with light. Now we belonged to the older students, knowing how things worked and what awaited us. While the neatly combed, stiffly dressed first-graders and their homeroom teacher stood beneath the flagpole listening to the principal's speech... Even though my only summer trip had been to Sør-Bjørnå, where I spent a week alone with Berit Hansnes, because there was a girl there—my distant cousin named Merete, with golden hair, who didn't live in Bergen—I had gone out with her.\n[1977-08-16 09:30:00] Schoolyard | We convinced them to use rubber bands for high jump, so we could fully participate without worrying about losing face in front of the other boys... One by one we ran toward it, leaped high, pulled the band down with our legs, and landed on the other side... Swish—you heard it, then saw them land firmly on the other side. Then the height increased, until finally only one person remained trying. Several girls loosened rubber bands from places that were completely mysterious to me, ready to start jumping. No—ready to start dancing... Two girls stretched a band between them. It was truly delightful watching the girls lift their legs high into the air, watching their graceful, controlled movements. I wished it were me. Now Ingeborg Lofnes had joined in, but as often happened, the last one remaining was Marianna.\n[1977-08-16 09:45:00] Schoolyard | She smiled shyly, brushing her shoulder-length light hair aside with her fingers. I wondered—could she be the one I’d fall in love with this year? Probably not. She’s in my class, after all. Maybe someone from Class A? Or hey, tempting future—maybe someone from another school?",

    "text": "[1977-08-16 10:00:00] classroom | Kristine Lof raised her hand and said she also wanted to be a candidate. After we received our timetables and some new books for the first class, everyone was supposed to take turns talking about what they had done over the summer. In the second lesson, we would hold a new student council election. Siv and I had been the class representatives last year. I thought, according to tradition, I would probably be elected again this time.\n[1977-08-16 10:30:00] classroom | Six candidates were running in the election, and Kristine Lof was one of them. I broke an unwritten rule—never vote for yourself. I pondered that the results might be close, so my vote could make all the difference. I considered the possibility that someone might find out I voted for myself, but I didn't think it could happen. It was a secret ballot, after all. The only person who could see the notes and recognize my handwriting was the teacher, and she wouldn’t say anything.\n[1977-08-16 10:45:00] classroom | I wrote Grete Lundnes in capital letters on a slip of paper, crumpled it into a ball, and handed it to the teacher as she walked around collecting votes in a hat. She wrote the six candidates’ names on the blackboard and called Solvi up to read each note aloud. For every name Solvi read, she marked a 'plus' sign behind the corresponding name on the board. My note hadn’t come up yet. Kristine Lof was getting almost all the boys’ votes... But then, finally—there it was! 'Grete Lundnes,' said Solvi, and the teacher drew a 'plus' under my name. I made a fatal mistake. I realized with panic that there were only a few slips left. I hadn’t received even a single vote yet! How could this be?\n[1977-08-16 10:55:00] classroom | 'Kristine Lof,' said Solvi. 'Kristine Lof.' 'Kristine Lof.'\n[1977-08-16 11:00:00] classroom | 'Now this seems to be the last vote? Let’s see here. This year’s class representatives are Kristine Lof and Marianne!' I lowered my eyes to the desk in front of me. One vote. How could this be? And that one was from me. I’m the best student in the class! At least in Leivik language. And in natural sciences too! In arithmetic, I’m second or third best. But altogether—added up—who could possibly be better than me? Okay, Kristine Lof won. But by just one vote? How could that happen? Not a single person voted for me? Something must have gone wrong. No one at all?\n[1977-08-16 15:00:00] home | When I opened the door, Dad was standing just inside the doorway. I stumbled slightly... He handed me a shopping list and a hundred-krone note... I dropped my backpack and ran back out. 'You’ll have to run an errand for me, to Yngve’s Grocery,' he said, 'look here.' ... 'Bring back all the change, understand?' 'Yes,' I said. How did he know I was about to come in? Had he been standing there waiting?\n[1977-08-16 15:10:00] Yngve's Grocery | I looked at the list. One kilo of potatoes, a pack of beef patties, two onions, coffee (for brewing), a can of pineapple, a quarter liter of cream, one kilo of oranges... I put the purchased items in the basket, stood for a few minutes by the magazine rack near the register flipping through the pages, paid, put the change in my pocket, and ran home swinging the rather heavy grocery bag. If there’s one thing in the world I’m most careful about, it’s Dad’s change. When Yngve’s Grocery first opened, Henrik Inge once kept the change for himself. Dad gave him a beating like never before. That period, Henrik Inge got beaten a lot. Much more than I ever did. Yes, relatively speaking, I could easily escape punishment during that time. Even my bedtime was much looser than his. Pineapple? Are we having dessert again? On a Monday?\n[1977-08-16 15:30:00] kitchen | I handed over the groceries and the change to Dad, who was in the upper kitchen. He stuffed the money into his pocket. I stayed where I was, waiting for him to give me permission to leave. But he didn’t. I sat down. I straightened my back. 'Sit down!' he said, pointing at the chair. 'Straighten your back, boy!' he said.\n[1977-08-16 15:40:00] kitchen | He took the dirt-covered potatoes out of the bag and began rinsing them... He continued speaking while still rubbing the potatoes under the stream from the tap... Then he went over to the cabinet beside the stove and pulled out a pot. 'Hmm?' he said, turning his head to look at me... 'Teacher’s nice, right?' he said... 'Teacher?' 'Yeah, the teacher. Didn’t she say anything to you all on the first day of school?' 'She welcomed us. Then she handed out timetables and some books.' 'Well, how did the timetable look?' he said... 'Should I go get it?' 'No, no. You remember something, don’t you? Looked good, right?' 'Yes,' I said, 'it was fine.' 'Good,' he said. What does he want? I looked at him with questioning eyes.\n[1977-08-16 20:00:00] home / living room | I slipped out of my room and came over there... Dad was sitting in his workshop downstairs. The living room and kitchen 'were there,' completely lifeless. The rooms were just rooms. I walked in, and still, they felt hollow. That evening I understood what Mom’s absence meant. The rooms had no life. A feeling seized me, as if I were alone out in the woods, where the forest was content with its own existence and had no desire to include or welcome me—that was exactly how it felt now.\n[1977-08-16 20:30:00] bedroom | Fortunately, my room is not like that. It wraps me in softness and kindness, always consistent.\n[1977-08-17 15:00:00] Yanhaoge Supermarket | The next day at Yanhaoge Supermarket, Karin Ingrid and Karlsen came toward me. Many of my classmates gathered around us. \"Grete Lundnes, who did you vote for yesterday?\" Karlsen asked. \"That's a secret,\" I said. \"You voted for yourself. You only got one vote—and it was your own.\" \"No, I didn't,\" I said. \"Yes, you did,\" Karin Ingrid said. \"We've already asked everyone in class. Nobody voted for you. So it must have been you. You voted for yourself.\" \"I didn't,\" I said. \"It's not true. I didn't vote for myself.\" \"Then who did?\" \"I don't know.\" \"We've already asked everyone. No one chose you. It had to be you. Just admit it.\" \"Then someone is lying.\" \"Why would anyone lie about that?\" \"I don't know.\"\n[1977-08-17 15:10:00] Yanhaoge Supermarket | \"You're the one lying. You voted for yourself.\" \"No, I didn't. I didn't vote for myself.\"\n[1977-08-17 16:00:00] school | Rumors spread through school... I never use vulgar slang, never steal from shops, never shoot birds with a slingshot or spit cherry pits into car exhaust pipes or onto passersby. When others lock the PE teacher in the storage room behind the gym, or put drawing pins on substitute teachers' chairs, or soak erasers with water before wiping the board, I never join in. On the contrary, I tell them they shouldn’t do these things—it’s wrong. All this does nothing for my reputation... I don’t swear, I don’t lie—unless in self-defense—don’t steal, don’t vandalize, don’t cause trouble for teachers. Though I care about clothes and appearance, and always want to do the right thing and do it well, others still don’t think highly of me. I’m not someone they’d like. I’m always ignored, avoided. If, for example, Toya Moen and Karlsen avoid me, then I’ll go find others, like Dalson, Marivik·Christian. But I refuse to admit any of it. I keep denying it. Everyone knows what happened, but as long as I don’t confess, they can’t be completely certain. They say this is exactly what I would do—because I think I’m someone special. But I’m not. Someone who can only vote for themselves is nobody... Still, I know I did the right thing, while others were wrong. Sometimes I pray God forgives them. For instance, when they swear. Then I pray for them. Dear God, forgive Toya Moen for swearing. That wasn’t his real intention. I have a long list of milder words I can use to express strong emotions. And when children gather together, no one is excluded—everyone is accepted, including me.",

Now people write about what it feels like to be alive... I started writing a book about a large sailing ship. I wrote the first ten pages, mostly about the people on board, things on deck, the food they ate, the cargo carried... Then I stopped writing. That autumn I also made a newspaper, three copies, which I put into three mailboxes—one belonging to Karlsen, one to Oskar Magnus, and one to Presbakmo. But I never heard them mention a single word about the newspaper. It was as if they vanished, as if they had never existed.\n[1977-09-25 09:00:00] on the way to the dump | One Sunday morning at the end of September... I stepped out the front door, crossed the damp gravel yard, wearing my beige jacket and blue jeans, heading up to Karl Larsdal’s place... Karl Larsdal stood outside, already ready, so we set off, skipping along. We climbed the hill, entering a long stretch of open field... We took off our jackets and tied them around our waists. Bright sunlight bathed the land, but the ground remained dark and damp where the sun hadn’t reached—like the shadow beneath the fir tree by our house. Boats covered with tarpaulins sat on the lawn, most of them plastic boats, but also some small rubber dinghies and one modern motorboat with a cabin, from a famous brand. The grass was yellow, the trees behind the house orange and red, the sky a deep blue. Dad had gone fishing, Mom was in the living room, and Henrik Inge had ridden his bike somewhere in the southern part of the island. Excitement and joy welled up in my stomach. Finally, we were heading to the dump.\n[1977-09-25 09:30:00] forest path | We passed Magnus Nord’s house, walked up the gravel road, through the yard gate—the end of the road and the beginning of the forest path... The slope grew steeper, and the stream roared down. There, we began to run... Ahead of us, someone was climbing the hill, so we slowed down... We turned to look at them. \"It’s Mr. Thomassen,\" Karl Larsdal said. \"I thought he was dead already!\" I said. On the other side of the land stood a new parish hall... Along the path, the stream flowed full and green, its surface rippling gently downward. The water’s color came from heather, grass, and trees leaning over the banks. Only the faint trembling of the surface revealed the current’s movement. White stones on the path looked dull and gray in the shade, but gleamed golden under sunlight. It was an elderly couple. Her hair was gray-white, wearing a knitted cardigan; he wore a corduroy jacket with leather patches on the elbows, leaning on a walking stick. His mouth hung open, jaw trembling. That was where the Ten Star Choir girls with light-blond hair rehearsed and met. We hadn’t seen him since he taught our class back in second grade.\n[1977-09-25 10:00:00] dump | We took our usual shortcut through the woods, emerging at the edge of the dump below the forest... We slid down the slope, weaving among garbage bags... We searched for paper bags and cardboard, and found quite a few magazines... I immediately set it aside... White plastic bags and black trash sacks piled like hills, glinting under the blazing sun. Dozens of seagulls shrieked and flapped their wings. Some piles rose high—perhaps four times our height—while elsewhere the bags lay scattered, uncollected. Among them were—weekly magazines for the elderly like *Family*, *Alles*, and *Leivik Weekly*; teen girl weeklies such as *Star*, *New New*, and *Romance*; stacks of newspapers, mostly *Window to the World* and *East Agder Post*, but also some *Our Home*, *Evening Post*, and *Leivik Daily*; we found *A Magazine* and *Woman and Fashion*, horse magazines for girls, *Donald Duck* comics, and a thick issue of the late-sixties *Phantom* album... Also a *Tianbao* album, several *Captain Sam* comics, and pocket editions of *Secret Agent X9*, which pleased me greatly. But none of this changed our original purpose—to find pornographic magazines like *All Men (Alle menn)*, *Playboy*, *Cocktail*, and *Harmony Report*, even foreign ones, because we had already begun circulating Baywick magazines, one titled *Weekend Sex*. We also hoped to find some Mochengdao and Øreskog magazines that no one else had discovered yet. But we didn’t find a single porn magazine! What happened? Had someone come here before us? We had to find something!\n[1977-09-25 11:00:00] dump | An hour later, we gave up, collapsing onto the heather, starting to read the ordinary magazines we’d collected... I stood up, pacing back and forth between the trees, gazing down at the stream below... I walked over to the two bags of empty bottles we’d found... I pulled one out... I turned the bottle in my hand... \"Should we go wading downstream?\" I called out. \"Sure, just let me finish reading this,\" Karl Larsdal said, eyes still glued to his magazine. \"Do you think you could fit your little dick inside this?\" I said. Karl Larsdal laid the magazine on his knees. \"Yeah… maybe,\" he said, \"if the neck isn’t too tight? Want to try?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Will you try too?\" Mostly long brown bottles from Aucity Brewery, with golden labels, but also some short, thick green Heineken bottles. The glass was smeared with mud and grass blades... The deep green glass sparkled in the sun. I imagined it had lain at the edge of a garden for quite some time, perhaps only picked up when someone cleaned up the yard before winter arrived. Maybe because my mind had been fixed on something entirely different all day—filled with anticipation—just sitting there wasn’t satisfying enough. Something was missing. Maybe now we should go wade in the stream?\n[1977-09-25 11:10:00] Landfill Forest | He stood up and walked over. He picked up a bottle... We walked to the trunk of a huge pine tree. I unbuckled my belt, pulled my pants down to my knees, and took out that little thing with one hand while holding the bottle with the other. I pushed my penis into the bottle mouth... I twisted my hips back and forth for a while while pushing forward hard, and it slid in. \"Does anyone here see us?\" he asked. \"No, you're crazy,\" I said, \"we are standing in the woods. But for safety, we can move over there.\" \"It can't get in,\" Karl Larsdal said, \"this won't work.\" \"I'm ready!\" I said, \"look here!\" None None The rigid and cold bottleneck pressed against my soft, warm skin. In fact, the mouth of the bottle was too narrow ... A shiver of pain ran down my spine. The narrow neck tightly encircled my penis, becoming even tighter.\n[1977-09-25 11:15:00] Landfill Forest | I turned toward him. To prove how tightly it was stuck, I let go of the bottle. The bottle hung at the root of my thigh. Karl Larsdal laughed. I tried to pull my little penis out. I pulled with all my might and finally pulled my little penis out of the bottle mouth. In the center of the glans, I saw a black beetle resting. I pinched the beetle, took it off from there, threw it far away with all my strength, while running back and forth, waving both arms in the air. \"But I can't move it anymore,\" I said, \"there's no space left here. It's completely jammed!\" \"Hahaha!\" He laughed. \"Oh! Oh, damn it!\" I shouted. \"What's wrong?\" Karl Larsdal said. \"Oh! Oh! Satan!\" \"Oh! Satan! Satan! Satan!\" I cried out. None None I felt a sharp pain shoot through my entire penis, a stinging sensation like from a knife or a piece of glass. I saw it was black with large claws.\n[1977-09-25 11:20:00] Landfill Forest | He first opened his mouth and looked at me. Then he started laughing. He laughed so hard that he fell onto the heather. I fastened the belt around my waist. As I walked up the hill, I made him swear three times that he would not tell anyone about this. We each carried a bag. \"What's wrong?\" Karl Larsdal said, \"What happened? What happened, Grete Lundnes?\" \"A beetle! It bit my little pussy!\" \"You mustn't tell anyone!\" I said, \"Do you understand?\" \"No... no way!\" Karl Larsdal said, \"Hahaha!\" I feel the sun scorching our exposed necks. None I think this is exactly the kind of thing that would make him laugh. I also said a short prayer because I used profanity.\n[1977-09-25 11:40:00] Near the parish church | We passed through the wilderness again, jumped over a stream, and reached the other side. We placed the bag containing the bottles among the bushes of the parish church. We pulled some ferns and grass tips, trying our best to cover them up. We looked around to make sure no one was near us, then calmly left and took the path beside the parish church, walking down along it. \"Are we going to the Finna gas station to exchange empty bottles for money now, what do you think?\" said Karl Larsdal. \"Do they accept beer bottles there?\" I asked. \"It's not certain,\" said Karl Larsdal, \"well, let's hide them first.\" None None We know that once you start running, it will attract others' attention.\n[1977-09-25 11:50:00] Outside Magnus Nord's house | I saw Magnus Nord standing outside the basement of the house he lived in, placing his bicycle wheels upside down in front of himself. He rotated the rear wheel, holding the pedal with one hand and the other hand holding a small plastic tube, oiling the chain. His black shiny hair hung over his cheeks. I watched him. He smiled at us. Karl Larsdal shook his head. He nodded. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Hi,\" we said. \"Where did you go?\" \"To the dump.\" \"What for?\" \"To find some pornographic magazines.\" Karl Larsdal said. \"Did you find them?\" Magnus Nord asked. \"I have a stack in my room,\" he said, \"do you want to borrow some?\" \"Oh, sure!\" Karl Larsdal said. \"Really?\" I said. None None I wonder what he is really saying, did he take the wrong medicine? It's a secret!\n[1977-09-25 11:55:00] Magnus Nord outside | None \"Are you two wanting to take them now?\" \"I have to go home for dinner,\" I said. \"Me too,\" Karl Larsdal said, \"but we can take them and hide them in the woods.\" Magnus Nord shook his head. \"No way. That would ruin them. You should take them home. But it's okay if you go back for dinner. I can bring them to you this afternoon.\" \"That's perfect. But we have to meet you outside. You can't ring the doorbell. Do you understand?\" \"Oh?\" he said, his eyes narrowing with a smile, \"You're afraid I might give the magazines to your father, aren't you?\" \"No, but... he would ask endless questions. Because you've never come to my house before.\" \"Okay,\" he said, \"so let's meet outside at five o'clock. I'll come then, okay?\" \"That's the time when the football match is on,\" I said. \"Then six o'clock. Don't say that you want to watch children's programs on TV at that time!\" \"Okay. Six o'clock.\" None None None",

    "text": "[1977-09-25 16:00:00] Kitchen | I saw my mother sitting in the kitchen reading a book. She put down the book. She smiled. I nodded. \"Hi,\" I said. \"Hi,\" she said, \"where have you been?\" \"Well,\" I said, \"just wandered around a bit. We found some empty bottles and plan to exchange them for money on Monday.\" \"Okay,\" she said. \"Are you going to make pizza tonight?\" I said. \"I thought so.\" \"That's great!\" I said. \"Have you read the book you got?\" \"I started reading it yesterday. It looks pretty good. Actually, I just want to go into the room and continue reading now.\" \"Go ahead,\" she said, \"there's still a quarter of an hour before dinner.\" I heard the radio was on, and saw that milk porridge was boiling on the stove. One side of the pot was already entirely covered with white milk residue, and there were traces of milk and rice grains on the stove plate, but they had mostly dried up, so I understood that the milk porridge had been cooked properly. None None\n[1977-09-25 17:00:00] Living Room | I hesitated and put down the book in my hand. I watched the Leivik football league with Henrik Inge and my father. As usual, he bought toffee and gave me and Henrik Inge each a football lottery ticket. I matched five games, and they both laughed at me. Dad said that filling in five correct numbers is as difficult as filling in ten. But if you fill in ten correctly, you can collect money from the Leivik football lottery center, but those who fill in five correctly actually have to pay money, he said. None I knew that when she returned home on Fridays, she would always bring something back. This time, she brought back a book. The title was \"A Wizard of Earthsea,\" written by Ursula K. Le Guin. After reading just the first few pages, I knew it was an excellent book. There were a total of twelve matches, with eight rows in each match. Henrik Inge got seven right, and my father got ten, but unfortunately, this time no one would pay the person who got ten right. Because my mother is at home, I am willing to spend as much time with her as possible. On the other hand, as long as she is at home, her presence itself makes my life completely different. At least when she is there, my father would never do anything bad. When she is around, he would never let his irritable and violent temper take over. He would control himself. Even if I am lying in bed and she is sitting in the kitchen, I am still safe. Because I know less than half, I have to decide what to fill in by rolling dice, and the final outcome would not be different anyway.\n[1977-09-25 17:58:00] Living Room | When all the results were settled, outside, Magnus Nord was riding his bicycle, speeding down the hill, with a heavy plastic bag secured on the back rack. I stood up. \"I said I wanted to go out for a while.\" \"What are you going out for now?\" Dad asked, \"The children's program is about to start.\" \"I don't want to watch it,\" I said, \"Also, I have a date with Karl Larsdal.\" \"A date,\" Dad said, \"Okay, then. But you have to come back before eight o'clock.\" \"Are you going out?\" Mom said, standing at the door, \"I thought you might come and make pizza with us?\" \"I really want to come and make pizza, if I didn't have a date,\" I said. \"Our son is starting to date,\" Dad said, \"You must be dating Karl Larsdal? Not some other girl friends?\" \"Yes, definitely Karl Larsdal,\" I said. \"Then, come home at eight o'clock,\" Mom said. None None None\n[1977-09-25 18:00:00] Home doorstep | Dad stood up. He pulled his pants up a bit and put one hand into his hair, messing it up. At that time, I was already walking towards the corridor. In the corridor below, I put on my sweatpants - a blue sweater and a blue quilted vest that Mom had just sewn, and then I opened the door and ran towards Magnus Nord, who was sitting on his bicycle, one foot on the pedal and the other touching the ground, with Karl Larsdal standing beside him. Both of them looked in my direction. \"Very soon, we'll have a night alone, Ciselle,\" he said. \"Let's go to the boat house below,\" I said, \"no one can see us there.\" \"OK,\" Magnus Nord said, \"then I'll ride around a bit. We'll meet below.\" None None I didn't hear her answer. Excited, my throat tightened and my whole body became rigid. If we are lucky enough, the forest is already dry now.\n[1977-09-25 18:10:00] Boathouse Hillside | Karl Larsdal and I ran down the dirt slope and reached the path. We jumped over the stream and sprinted toward the lower incline, crossed a wild field, and passed over the gravel road. As we approached the grassy hillside, we slowed our pace—just then Magnus Nord appeared at the top of the slope, beside that old white house. The earth seemed to tremble beneath our feet. I knew Magnus Nord was two years older than us and often kept to himself—at least that’s how he appeared to us. His high cheekbones, narrow eyes, and slick black hair gave him an Indian-like look, which made him intriguing to the girls. This change had only recently begun. From one day to the next, Magnus Nord became the subject of their whispers and attention. What was strange wasn’t that he suddenly drew interest—he had always existed in some kind of shadow—but rather that the girls spoke about him almost proudly, as if by making such an unusual choice, they themselves had become noteworthy, even more so than him. Yet he continued living his own life, riding his bike aimlessly from place to place, always alone, yet always friendly toward us.\n[1977-09-25 18:15:00] Boathouse Hillside | He kicked down the bicycle stand, lifted the rack’s pressure bar, grabbed his bag, and ambled slowly toward us. By then, Karl Larsdal and I were already lying on the grass, each of us chewing on a long blade of grass. He gripped the bottom of the bag and dumped all the magazines out onto the grass, spreading them wide. \"Time for porn magazines!\" he said. It was an orange DBS racing bike, with tape peeling off one handlebar, dangling loosely.\n[1977-09-25 18:20:00] Boathouse Hillside | I grabbed a magazine, rolled over on the grass, and let my body go completely slack. I studied the photos page by page, focusing on just one part at a time. I saw the sun hanging low in the sky above the hills behind us, stretching his shadow long across the ground. From the narrow fjord’s islands nearby came the sharp cries of seagulls. For instance, breasts—I needed only a single glance to feel a jolt of excitement ripple through my entire body like electric current. Thighs too, and the small opening between them would almost magnetically seize my gaze—parted slightly or widely, reddish in tone, glistening faintly. Often, a finger or two, or lips—usually open—were placed beside it. The faces often wore expressions of twisted agony. And those two round, beautiful buttocks—I could no longer lie still. These weren’t merely body parts; they felt more like an entire world you could step into, like an endless sea with no beginning or end, a sea you’d sink helplessly into the very first moment you saw it, the very first photo.\n[1977-09-25 18:30:00] Boathouse Hillside | He shook his head. I nodded, and he handed me the magazine. \"See those soft little holes like bread, Karl Larsdal?\" I said. \"But here’s a massive breast. Wanna see?\"\n[1977-09-25 18:40:00] Boathouse Hillside | Magnus Nord sat a few meters away from us, legs crossed, holding a magazine. But after only a few minutes, he tossed it aside and stood up. As I looked up at him, I shielded my eyes from the sun. \"I’ve seen these many times,\" he said. \"Soon I’ll need some new ones.\" \"Where do you get these magazines?\" I asked. \"I buy them.\" \"You buy them?\" I said. \"Yeah.\" \"But they’re all old though?\" \"They’re just old magazines, you idiot. There’s a barber shop in town that sells old magazines. They’ve got plenty of these kinds of porn mags.\" \"You can actually buy them?\" \"Of course,\" he said.\n[1977-09-25 18:50:00] Boathouse Hillside | I stared at him for a few seconds. Then I went back to flipping through the magazine. Suddenly, on one page, I saw two girls on a tennis court. I kept turning the pages. They wore short tennis skirts—one light blue, one white—white shirts, sweatbands around their wrists, white socks, and white tennis shoes. Each held a racket. One girl lay on the grass, her shirt already pulled up, exposing her breasts. Her head was thrown back. Was she not wearing underwear either? Bare, completely naked. Soon, both were entirely nude, knees pressed against the net, their backsides raised high into the air. Was he lying to me? It didn’t seem like it. They weren’t really going to play tennis, were they? That’s incredible. Amazing. Absolutely perfect.\n[1977-09-25 19:00:00] Boathouse Hillside | He quickly glanced over at me and nodded. Magnus Nord had already walked over to the ruined old house and now stood there, skipping stones across the water. \"Look here, Karl Larsdal,\" I said, \"two girls playing tennis!\" The surface of the water was calm. Each flat stone he flicked sideways skimmed across the surface, creating small circular ripples with every touch. Because he was completely absorbed in his magazine and didn’t want to waste time. Those little stones must have been picked up from the muddy riverbank by the water’s edge.\n[1977-09-25 19:15:00] Boathouse Hillside | When he stood before us again, I might have already gone through three or four magazines. I looked up at him. He kicked up the bike stand, waved one hand in the air, and with the other gripped the center of the handlebars, starting to ride up the slope. \"I like looking from above,\" I said. \"Hahaha! So you enjoy grinding downward, eh?!\" he said. \"Yeah,\" I replied. \"I can imagine,\" he said, \"but now I’ve got to go. You two can keep the magazines if you want. I’m sick of them.\" \"Can we really have them?\" Karl Larsdal asked. \"Be my guest.\" He looked as if he were leading some kind of livestock.",

    "text": "[1977-09-25 20:00:00] Living Room | We both agreed that Karl Larsdal would take the magazines home. An hour later, when we parted outside my house, we didn’t mention it again. On Saturday evenings, we always ate dinner at the dining table in the living room. Dad cut a slice of pizza and placed it on my plate. I poured some cola from a one-liter bottle into my glass. Mom’s pizza had a thick base, with edges rising high around the sides, allowing it to hold generous amounts of meat, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, red peppers, and cheese—like a plain encircled by mountains stretching outward. On this bottle, the words 'Coca-Cola' were printed in white on pale green glass, instead of the usual red label. We never ate in front of the TV—it was simply unimaginable. Pepsi wasn’t available in the southern region; we could only drink it during the Leivik Cup football tournament. So besides being able to ride the subway and eat as much cereal as we wanted at the buffet breakfast, drinking Pepsi was another benefit of attending the match.\n[1977-09-25 20:30:00] Living Room | After finishing the pizza, Dad asked if we’d like to try a new game. We agreed. Mom was clearing the table while Dad fetched a notebook and four pens from his office downstairs. Dad called to Mom inside, who was washing dishes. She came over to us. \"Do you want to join, Sissel?\" \"Sure,\" Mom said. \"What are we playing? A dice game?\" \"No,\" Dad said. \"Each of us takes a sheet of paper and writes six categories: Country, City, River, Ocean, Lake, and Mountain. Write one line for each category. Then we pick a letter, and within three minutes, we write as many names as possible that start with that letter.\" Soap suds clung to her forearm and the tips of two fingers.\n[1977-09-25 20:35:00] living room | Dad laughed. Henrik Inge had already started writing, shielding the paper with one hand. \"Any reward?\" Henrik Inge said. \"Only an honor prize. The winner will be the family champion.\" \"You all start first,\" Mom said, \"I'll go make some tea for everyone.\" \"We'll try one round first,\" Dad said, \"then we'll play seriously when you come back.\" He looked at us. \"M,\" he said, \"the letter is M. Are you following?\" \"Following,\" Henrik Inge said. \"Following,\" I said. We'd never played this game before. But it looked fun.\n[1977-09-25 20:38:00] living room | Mount Blanc—I wrote that under 'mountains.' Mandal, Morristown, Mjøndalen, Molde, Kristianvik, Metropolis, and Munich were city names. \"Time's up,\" Dad said. I couldn't think of any oceans or rivers. Then countries—were there even any countries starting with M? I ran through every country name I knew in my head. Still nothing. Was Mørev a river? Motown was at least a city. Cities in the Middle East? Ah—yes! Mississippi!\n[1977-09-25 20:40:00] living room | Just a quick glance at their papers made it clear I had lost. When I read 'Morristown,' both Dad and Henrik Inge burst out laughing. \"Read out what you've written, Grete Lundnes,\" Dad said. \"Don't laugh at me!\" I said. \"Morristown only exists in 'The Phantom,'\" Henrik Inge said, \"do you really think you can find it in the real world?\" \"So what?\" I shot back, \"Sara works at the United Nations building in New York—that exists! Why can't Morristown exist too?\" \"Well argued, Grete Lundnes,\" Dad said, \"for that, you get half a point.\"\n[1977-09-25 20:45:00] living room | I made a face at Henrik Inge, and he gave me a mocking grin in return. We each went in to pick up our cups. I added milk and sugar to my tea. \"Now the tea's here,\" Mom said. \"Then let's officially begin,\" Dad said, \"we'll play three rounds. That way we can keep going until bedtime.\" It seemed Mom knew about as many names as I did. Or perhaps she just wasn't as fully invested as Henrik Inge and Dad. But either way, it worked well for me—two against two.\n[1977-09-25 21:30:00] living room | \"I've gone back to using my maiden name. So now I'm Hartleøy, not Grete Lundnes anymore.\" \"You're not Grete Lundnes anymore?\" I said, gaping at her, \"but you're our mom!\" She smiled. \"Yes, of course I am! I'll always be your mom!\" \"But why? Why do you have a different last name from ours?\" \"I was born Cecilie Hartleøy, you know. That's my real name. Grete Lundnes is Dad's name. It's yours!\" \"Are you getting divorced?\" After Dad had tallied the first round's scores, she said she had changed her surname. My body froze. I felt cold all over.\n[1977-09-25 21:35:00] living room | Mom and Dad both laughed. I looked at him. Dad shook his head. I began to sob. \"No, we're not divorcing,\" Mom said, \"we're just using our own surnames.\" \"But it's not very wise,\" Dad said, \"because from now on, we won't be able to see Grandma and Grandpa. They don't like that your mother changed her name, so they won't visit us anymore.\" \"What about Christmas?\" I said.\n[1977-09-25 21:40:00] living room / bedroom | I pushed my chair back—it tilted—and stood up, then ran into my room. As I shut the door, I heard someone following behind. \"There's nothing worth crying over, Grete Lundnes,\" Dad said, \"this will pass. They're just angry right now. Everything will pass.\"\n[1977-09-25 21:45:00] bedroom | I lay on the bed, buried my face in the pillow, and began to cry loudly. My tears had never flowed so endlessly before. Dad spoke behind me, sitting on the edge of the bed. Amid sobs and shudders, my body curled into a tight ball. \"Grete Lundnes,\" Dad said, \"don't be so upset. Is being with Grandma and Grandpa really that much fun?\" \"It is!\" I shouted into the pillow.\n[1977-09-25 22:00:00] bedroom | He placed his hand on my shoulder, but only for a brief moment. Then he stood up and left the room. \"But if they don't want to see your mother, wouldn't visiting them be less fun? Do you understand that? They don't want to see us.\" \"Why did she change her name?\" I cried. \"It's her own name,\" Dad said, \"if she wants to. Then neither you nor I, nor Grandma and Grandpa, can take that right away from her. Don't you agree?\"\n[1977-09-26 00:00:00] bedroom | When my tears finally dried, I pulled out the book Mom had bought for me and continued reading. I realized Henrik Inge had gone back to sleep, the sliding door closed. They were together in the living room listening to music, but there was no sign of joy. From the first sentence, I sank deeply into the story, deeper and deeper. The protagonist was named Ged, who lived on an island and possessed a special gift. People discovered his talent and sent him to a school for wizards. There, his extraordinary abilities flourished. Once, driven by overwhelming pride, he performed a feat that opened a gate to another world—the underworld, the land of the dead—and released a shadow. Ged nearly died, weakened and scarred by the experience, and the shadow pursued him relentlessly. He managed to escape, hiding where people of the world could not see him, abandoning all ideals and ambitions because he believed he could only perform the most basic magic—empty gestures and hollow tricks. Yet another kind of magic existed, deeper and interwoven with all things in the world. The wizard’s greatest task was to maintain the balance among all things. Every object had its true name, and that name reflected its essence. Only by knowing the true names of all things could one master and control them. Ged could do this, though he didn’t know it himself. For every spell, every use of magic, disturbed the original balance, causing unforeseen consequences elsewhere. The villagers thought him a poor wizard because he refused even the simplest tricks, unlike the village sorcerers who earned their living from such acts. He was young, solemn, bore a large scar across his face, and was especially sensitive to cold. But when something truly mattered, when he truly had to use his gift, he would not hesitate. Once, when a child lay near death, he followed the child into the land of the dead and brought him back—though he shouldn’t have. It was extremely dangerous, for certain balances must never be broken, and the balance between life and death was one of them. Yet he did it, and during the process, he himself came close to dying. That was the first time the villagers understood who he really was. And the shadow that had slipped out from the land of the dead kept chasing him, watching him, drifting across the world. Whenever he used his power, the shadow would sense it and draw nearer. He had to flee. So he did—he boarded a ship, intending to cross the ocean to the farthest shore from the island. The shadow drew closer and closer. After several confrontations, Ged stood on the brink of death, facing a final showdown. He had long tried to discover the shadow’s name—searching ancient records of the oldest beings, questioning wiser wizards—but found nothing. He faced an unknown creature, one without a name. But then, suddenly, he understood. At sea, alone in his boat, as the shadow approached, he realized it. The shadow was called Ged. The shadow bore his name. The shadow was himself.",

    "text": "[1977-10-10 19:00:00] Dalson's house | A group of children ran back and forth playing, now eastward, now westward, never staying in one place. That autumn I was often in Dalson’s room. After running through the darkness outside, our cheeks were all flushed red; we would sit down in his room to play Monopoly while listening to a song from his Beatles album—there were two albums, red and blue—playing on the cassette player. During the chorus, we could sing along loudly, almost screaming like they did. Autumn was pitch-black, made of fields, streams, and caves. Breathing sounds, laughter, flashlight beams, pine-branch shelters, bonfires. I lived two lives, one at home and one outside, as I always had, and so did everyone else. On Saturday evenings, sitting in front of the television with my parents and siblings, they seemed so different—much gentler and more obedient than when we were down in the woods. Outside, we were completely free, nothing could stop us from indulging our wildest impulses. This difference was especially noticeable in the fall. In spring and summer, life generally took place outdoors, and the connection between children's lives and adults' lives operated on a different scale. But when autumn arrived and darkness fell earlier and earlier, that connection seemed to be severed. As soon as the door closed behind us at home, we could slip into a world entirely our own. These short, dark, cold evenings were filled to the brim with unseen and hidden excitement and emotion. And there was also the joy inside the rooms. Although I couldn’t bring my friends home—no child from the housing estate had ever entered my room—I could go to their rooms. Some houses I visited only occasionally, others frequently. We didn’t care about the meaning of the English lyrics—we just followed the melody. Later, we increasingly preferred the blue album because its melancholy tunes were unlike anything we’d heard before. My favorite was the red one. Those were their earliest songs, simple and joyful.\n[1977-10-15 20:00:00] housing estate / woods | We stood there peering inside. I smelled the scent of the house. I felt the damp darkness, so that we could sense it not just with our eyes but with our entire bodies. I saw the light from the streetlamps. The atmosphere created by many people together, voices in the dark, surrounding bodies brushing against mine. The foghorn sound coming from the harbor. The hut built above the floating dock in the woods, empty at night but with lights glowing in the windows. Were those pornographic magazines thrown there? Ah, yes. These nights were among the happiest of my life. It’s strange, because there was nothing particularly special about them—we did exactly what all boys do: sit around playing games, listening to music, opening up, talking about whatever came into our heads. But I loved the smell of that house. I loved being there. I loved the darkness we had just come through—it gave everything an extraordinary quality. I especially loved the damp darkness. I loved the light from the streetlamps. I loved the atmosphere created when many people were together. I loved the sound of the foghorn from the harbor. Just think—on such a night, anything could happen. I loved striding around everywhere, discovering unexpected objects, stumbling into unforeseen situations.\n[1977-10-15 20:10:00] housing estate | Until then, no one had dared to break a window and crawl in to take them out. But suddenly the possibility emerged. We knew someone would do it soon, maybe even us. At some point during this period, perhaps in the morning, a picture torn from a pornographic magazine might lie right in the middle of the road. During this time, you might find such a magazine in a ditch, on the grass, or under a bridge. We didn’t know who had left them there—they seemed to have been scattered by God’s hand, like sea anemones, pussy willows, rushing streams, or smooth rocks—part of nature itself. These magazines shared certain characteristics: either holes in the pages caused by moisture, or brittleness and fragmentation due to dryness; they were often faded from sun exposure and stained with dirt. When I think about these magazines, a wave of fear spreads through my whole body. It has nothing to do with how we talked about them—we certainly talked about them often, laughed about them, devoured them hungrily—the fear comes from somewhere else, buried so deep that reason can never reach it.\n[1977-10-15 20:20:00] housing estate | I sniffed the scent of moist soil and wet mountains. You could imagine that many youths in the housing estate probably had pornographic magazines at home—those who, without exception, would buy a motorcycle as soon as they could, start smoking, skip school, in short, the ones who hung out at the gas station. The bad boys. So two incompatible forces arose within me. The pornographic magazines represented evil power, yet they injected into me an intense fear that I swallowed again and again, while simultaneously arousing an uncontrollable craving. When I saw the naked women in the magazines, my knees would weaken. It was incredibly wonderful, and terrifying—worlds opened before me, gates of hell swung wide, light blazed, darkness collapsed. We just wanted to stand there flipping through the pages, we could stand there forever, beneath the heavy, dense branches of pine trees, staring at these photos. The women seemed to have just risen from the marsh, straightened up on the yellowing autumn grass—they felt closely connected to both. Many of the magazines were already tattered, but we had seen various damaged ones and knew they always affected us, and that feeling would never leave us. So whenever rumors spread about a new magazine appearing, we immediately began tracking it down.\n[1977-10-15 20:30:00] housing estate | We sat in the woods looking at the half-naked women inside, loudly discussing what Donald Duck and Dolly were doing to pretend we were reading comic books, so as not to arouse suspicion. We circled around it, but the door was locked. We didn’t have enough courage to break the glass, climb onto the windowsill, and retrieve the magazines. We tried to look for other ways. Karl Larsdal was one of the most eager about this. In second grade, he had already taken his father’s copy of *Vi Menn* (We Men). Now, there were pornographic magazines in the hut. But desire had already been awakened. Should we search the pile of wood near the car wreckage in the woods? Or check the ditch on the other side of the bus stop next to Rådhauge Supermarket? The woods under the bridge? Damn, what about the dump! There must be some there? Hundreds? Thousands?\n[1977-11-15 19:00:00] home | After finishing the last page of the book, I turned off the light. It was nearly midnight, and my eyes were full of tears. Nightfall came earlier and earlier, and the window reflected my figure moving around inside the room. That autumn and winter, I stayed home alone at least once a week, usually twice. Dad went to meetings, Henrik Inge was practicing with the school band or training with the volleyball and football teams, or visiting friends. The shadow is himself! I love being alone at home—no one telling me what to do or ordering me around. It feels great. But I don’t really enjoy being alone either. It’s unpleasant because it always makes me think of death and the dead.\n[1977-11-15 19:05:00] home | When I lifted my head from the book and stood up. The darkness standing outside pressed against me like a wall, cutting me off from everything. I know it isn't true, but what good does knowing that do? It was especially terrifying when I was completely lost in reading—I felt as if I didn’t belong anywhere. I was alone—that’s how I felt then, utterly and completely alone.",

    "text": "[1977-11-15 19:10:00] bathroom | I made full use of this freedom: I let water fill the bathtub, sat in it, switched on the tape recorder, letting warm water cover my body. I sang, my voice echoing. I submerged my head underwater. One, two, three, four. I stayed underwater for four seconds. He didn’t like me taking baths too often—he believed once a week was sufficient—and he watched my bathing frequency closely, just as he monitored every other thing I did. Ah, I can take a bath—if I still have enough time before Dad comes home. I could see myself from the outside, mouth open, as if my head were a skull. I plunged my head underwater and suddenly felt horror: I couldn’t see anything! Maybe something had attached itself to me! Is anyone there! Those four seconds opened a wormhole in time—someone might have slipped through. Perhaps not into the bathroom—no, the bathroom was empty—but maybe they had already entered the house.\n[1977-11-15 19:10:00] kitchen | On such a night, I knelt on a kitchen stool in the dark, gazing out the window. Outside, wind and snow raged. The wind swept across the land with a mournful howl, the gutter under the eaves creaked, the chimney pipe rustled. It was pitch black outside, no one visible under the dim yellow glow of the streetlights, only swirling snowflakes filling the air. Under these conditions, the best thing I could do was turn off the light in the kitchen or my room and look outside, because then, without reflected light on the window, I could see the houses outside, other families, and sometimes other children out there. There is nothing safer than being a spectator.\n[1977-11-15 20:00:00] kitchen / hallway | A car drove up. It came from the roundabout, heading toward our house. It turned into the driveway and stopped. I ran out of the kitchen, down the stairs, and into the outer hallway. I stood there. The car was coming here? No doubt about it. Who could it be? Nobody ever visits us. Who could this be? I was afraid.\n[1977-11-15 20:15:00] doorway | I walked all the way to the front gate and pressed my nose against the glass of the door. The car door opened, and a dark figure tumbled out! It crawled forward on all fours. It swayed toward me like a bear. It stopped beneath the doorbell, then straightened up! I backed away. The shadow dropped onto all fours again. Then it stood up once more, pressed the doorbell, and immediately dropped back down onto its hands and feet. Ding—dong, the doorbell rang. There's no need to open the door—I can tell who it is just by standing here. Oh no! Oh no! What is that? Is it that terrible snowman? That hairy monster? Here? In Tibaken?\n[1977-11-15 20:20:00] doorway | I opened the door, and at that very moment, the dark figure began wriggling backward. It turned around. It was the man from the city government who is paralyzed in his body. My heart started pounding wildly, like a drum. But I understood immediately. Ah, of course! It had to be this way. That hateful snowman couldn't have driven here. It was him.\n[1977-11-15 20:25:00] doorway | I shook my head. \"Hi,\" he said, \"Is your father home?\" \"No,\" I said, \"He went to a meeting.\" \"Give him my regards and say I stopped by.\" \"Okay,\" I said. This man has a beard, wears glasses, and has tiny specks of saliva at the corners of his mouth; he often drives around town in his special car, giving rides to young people. He sighed.\n[1977-11-15 20:30:00] doorway / bedroom | Using his arms, he dragged himself to the car, opened the door, and hoisted himself into the seat. I stared wide-eyed. He shifted positions repeatedly, then the car started moving—slowly, laboriously. He started the engine, reversed up the slope, then drove down onto the road. The car disappeared. I closed the door and went upstairs to my room.\n[1977-11-15 20:35:00] stairs / bedroom | I had just lain down on the bed when the door downstairs opened. From the sound, I knew it was Henrik Inge. I got up and went out. \"Are you there?\" he called from the stairs. \"I'm starving,\" he said, \"Shall we have a late snack now?\" \"It's only just past eight,\" I said. \"The sooner the better,\" he said, \"Then I can brew some tea. Besides, I really am hungry.\" \"Alright, call me when the tea's ready,\" I said.\n[1977-11-15 20:40:00] kitchen | Fifteen minutes later, we sat down with bread, each with a large teacup in front of us. I nodded. \"A car came here tonight, didn't it?\" Henrik Inge said. \"The cripple from city hall.\" \"What did he want?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Someone talked about you today,\" he said. \"Oh?\" I said. \"Yes. Ellen.\" \"Well, what did she say?\" \"She said the way you walk is strange.\" \"She didn't say that!\" \"She did. It's true, isn't it? You walk a bit oddly—haven't you ever noticed?\" \"I don't!\" I shouted. I felt cold all over.\n[1977-11-15 20:45:00] kitchen | He stood up and began walking across the kitchen floor, each step looking as if he were about to fall backward. I watched him, tears welling in my eyes. He sat down. I threw the bread at him with all my strength. He dodged, and the bread hit the stove with a soft thud. \"Ah, you do,\" said Henrik Inge, \"Little shrimp, can't walk properly.\" \"I walk just as normally as anyone else—nothing different about me,\" I said. \"That's what Ellen said, not me,\" he said, \"They're talking about you, you know. You're a bit odd.\" \"I'm not odd!\" I yelled.\n[1977-11-15 21:00:00] kitchen / living room | I stood up holding my teacup. Henrik Inge saw me and rose too. I hurled the hot tea at him. It splashed onto his stomach. I lunged at him, pounding his belly with all my might. He grabbed my arms, twisted my body, I tried to break free, but he held me firmly. I tried to kick him, but he pulled me tighter. I tried to bite his hand, but he shoved me away. I charged at him again, but he knew exactly what to do—he'd been through this before—so he gripped me tightly as usual, pinning me until I tried to bite him, at which point he couldn't dodge anymore and pushed me off. I ran out of the kitchen. On the living room table was a fruit bowl; I grabbed an orange, and with all my strength smashed it onto the floor. The orange burst, spraying a small jet of juice upward, running down the wallpaper. \"Now our little boy is angry?\" he said. \"You look so cute when you're mad, Grete Lundnes,\" he said, \"Poor little shrimp. Maybe I should teach you how to walk? I walk just fine, you know.\" \"Alright, alright,\" he said. Tears filled my eyes, but that wasn't why I couldn't see—my vision was blocked because I was burning with rage. A red haze clouded my sight. All I could think about was punching his smug face, smashing his nose, and if I had a knife, I wouldn't hesitate to stab it into his gut. And still calling me 'little shrimp,' saying how 'cute' I looked when angry. But this time, I wouldn't just let it go.\n[1977-11-15 21:10:00] living room / kitchen | Henrik Inge stood in the doorway watching. I looked at him. Then I glanced at the stain on the wallpaper. Henrik Inge just stared at me. He bent down, picked up the orange, and walked into the kitchen. Then came a clatter—I realized he had shoved the orange deep into the trash bin. He returned with a cloth and wiped the floor. My body trembled violently; I could barely stand. \"What did you do?\" he said. \"You better clean it all up, you idiot,\" I said. \"It won't come off,\" he said, \"The mark will only spread the more you rub. Dad will go ballistic when he sees it. Why did you do this?\" \"He might not notice,\" I said. \"Let's hope so,\" he said. The stain was thin but long. I couldn't imagine how Dad could possibly miss it when he came home.\n[1977-11-15 21:20:00] kitchen | Henrik Inge washed the teaspoon and the two cups. He threw away the bread slices and wiped every crumb from the table. I sat on a chair at the dining table, holding my head in both hands. Henrik Inge stopped in front of me. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"I didn't mean to make you cry.\" \"I know, I get it.\" \"But you got so angry,\" he said, \"You have to understand—it was just teasing? I've apologized already.\" \"It's not that,\" I said. \"Then what is it?\" \"I walk strangely.\" \"Come on, it's over,\" he said, \"Everyone walks differently. The most important thing is being able to move forward. It was just a joke, right? I just wanted to provoke you, make you mad. And I succeeded. Your walk isn't any stranger than anyone else's.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Of course. As solid as a bank. Undeniable.\"",

    "text": "[1977-11-15 23:30:00] bedroom | I was already asleep when Dad came home. I lay in the dark, following his footsteps. He didn’t stop in the hallway as I had hoped, but went straight into the kitchen. He fiddled around in there for a while before coming out again, and this time he didn’t pause either. He didn’t notice the wallpaper. We’re safe.\n[1977-11-16 18:00:00] Stintahallen | I went to swimming lessons with Karl Larsdal. We took the bus from Holt to the city station, each carrying our backpacks on our shoulders, then walked up the hill toward Stintahallen. My backpack contained a dark blue Arena swimsuit, a white Speedo swim cap printed with the Leivik flag along the edge, a pair of Speedo goggles, a bar of soap, and a towel. I remember that since last winter we’ve been part of Aucity’s swimming club. Back then we couldn’t really swim—we’d just flail desperately from one end of the pool to the other without stopping until we were completely exhausted. But because being able to swim was the minimum requirement for joining the club, and because the coach—a man with wooden clogs and tattoos on his arms—was always pacing alongside the pool, shouting at us, we learned how to swim surprisingly quickly and without much difficulty.\n[1977-11-16 18:30:00] swimming hall | The swimming hall buzzed with voices; outside the windows it was pitch black. I saw the lane dividers floating between the lanes like coral necklaces, the starting blocks, and the long, warm thirty-minute showers after swimming. I knew we weren’t very good swimmers, at least not compared to the older boys whose limbs were long, thin, and muscular. They swam with their mouths open, wearing insect-eyed goggles, shooting through the water like jets. Sometimes I thought that compared to them, we looked more like tadpoles—floundering and struggling, clawing our way along the edges of the pool. Our skills were improving bit by bit, and soon we’d be able to swim a thousand meters in a single training session. I realized I would never become a competitive swimmer, because during races I always gave my all, yet still never did well enough—even failing to overtake Karl Larsdal. No, what I loved was everything else: from the moment we boarded the bus, traveling through darkness, walking the path into Aucity, passing through the empty nighttime city, pausing at the same shops along the way. I loved entering the swimming hall itself, that large public building which blended the outside and inside so perfectly. It felt as if we passed through a funnel: standing in the outer corridor bundled tightly in winter clothes, then fifteen minutes later standing nearly naked, having completed the ritual of undressing, showering, putting on swimsuits and caps. Now we stood at the edge of the pool, clad only in small swim trunks, ready to leap into that strange, transparent coolness tinged with chlorine. That was what I truly loved. Then the whole process reversed: we transformed from pale-skinned, bony boys with big heads and almost bare bodies back into fully dressed boys stepping outside, wet hair hidden under hats, skin still faintly smelling of chlorine, limbs limp yet deeply content.\n[1977-11-16 19:00:00] pool | Water might seep into my goggles, sloshing into my eyes. I might swallow water or fail to grab the wall properly when turning, leaving me breathless and gulping even more. I could see the swimmer in the next lane pulling far ahead of me. I quickened my strokes, giving it everything for a few seconds, but made little progress. Karl Larsdal still swam ahead of me, touching the edge first, then finally my hand reached it. I also liked the feeling of being sealed off when I put on my swim cap and goggles, especially during races, when I had an entire lane all to myself waiting beneath the starting block. While waiting there, I often felt a kind of loneliness, confusion, and sometimes anxiety similar to that of an astronaut. This both hurt and blurred my vision, making it hard to concentrate. An inner voice urged me to fight for victory, and I would argue with it. Yet even when this internal dialogue remained calm, as I swam trying to do everything perfectly, a sense of near panic still surrounded me—like a military command center deep underground where officers calmly discuss tactics while a fierce battle rages overhead, enemy and ally locked in chaos. I couldn’t understand it—I was actually stronger than him, I knew far more than he did, and I wanted to win even more than he did.\n[1977-11-16 19:30:00] shower room | I heard the coach blow his whistle. I sighed in relief, placed my arms on the pool edge, hoisted myself up, and ran across the tiled floor with Karl Larsdal into the inner shower room. Inside, time seemed to slow down—at least we slowed our pace once we removed our caps and pulled off our swim trunks. We stepped under the showerheads, closed our eyes, and let the warmth spread through our bodies. There was a dreamlike atmosphere inside. I saw pale bodies moving slowly from the doorway, standing under the showers in a contemplative state. The sound of water hitting tiles merged with low murmurs from outside. Steam fogged the air, and whenever someone spoke, their voice echoed hollowly and dully. This training session was over. There was no need to say or do anything now, even if someone—now that the swimming hall was open to everyone—walked in singing to themselves. We didn’t have to laugh.\n[1977-11-16 19:45:00] shower room | Usually we stayed there a long time after everyone else who trained with us had left. Karl Larsdal faced the wall, while I turned my face toward the room to hide my buttocks. His arms were thinner than mine, but he was stronger. I was slightly taller, but he moved more nimbly. But that wasn’t why he swam faster than me. He was faster because his belief in winning was stronger. And then there was his drawing—it was his specialty, a natural talent always present within him. Aside from people, he could depict everything else with precise accuracy and vivid realism: houses, cars, ships, trees, tanks, airplanes, rockets. He never copied things like I did, and his mother never allowed him to use rulers or erasers. Sometimes he said odd things—he’d say 'bad think' instead of 'fantasy,' or 'square-shape' instead of 'square.' He wouldn’t say 'an orange,' but 'a piece of orange.' Though I corrected him every time, he kept doing it, as if these strange words were fixed parts of him, like the color of his eyes or the position of his teeth. When he wasn’t looking at me, I’d sometimes glance at him. How did he do it? It was astonishing, almost like a mystery.\n[1977-11-16 20:00:00] shower room | I said, 'They look like raisins.' He said, 'Mine too,' he said, 'Imagine—our whole bodies look like this when we swim!' I said, 'My balls are always wrinkled like this.'\n[1977-11-16 20:05:00] shower room | We both bent down to look. I slowly stroked the hard yet sensitive skin with one finger. I picked up a bar of soap and tossed it across the room. It slid along the floor, stopped by the corner wall, and lay on a drain grate. I turned off the shower, about to follow Karl Larsdal to dry off, but picked it up again and threw it into the trash bin against the wall. I pressed my face into a dry towel. I said, 'It feels so good rubbing it with your hands.' A shiver ran through me. In that instant, I suddenly couldn’t bear the sight of the soap lying in the middle of the floor.\n[1977-11-16 20:10:00] shower room | I laughed. I saw Karl Larsdal take a few steps forward, legs apart. Karl Larsdal said, 'Imagine what our little dicks will look like with hair.' I said, 'Imagine the hair growing super long!' 'Down to our knees!' 'Then we’ll have to comb them!' 'Or tie them in a ponytail!' 'Or go to the barber! I want mine trimmed a bit, please!' 'Alright. What kind of haircut do you want?' 'Shave it all, leave just the dick, thanks!'\n[1977-11-16 20:15:00] shower room / changing room | Just then the door opened, and we stopped laughing. An older, fat man with sad eyes walked in. He politely nodded at us, then turned away shyly to take off his swimsuit. Our laughter abruptly ceased... We grabbed our swimming gear and left the shower room... Then we slammed the door behind us and ran into the changing room. Karl Larsdal shouted, 'His thing must be huge!' I said, 'Maybe it’s tiny!' The sudden silence left by our cut-off laughter was instantly filled with our suppressed giggles.\n[1977-11-16 20:20:00] changing room | We sat there laughing for a while, until we calmed down and slowly began gathering our things, getting dressed. I wondered whether he had heard us at all. At that moment, the only sounds were footsteps on the linoleum floor from inside, the rustle of legs sliding into trousers, arms moving through jacket sleeves, the sharp noise of lockers opening or closing, and a man’s groan—probably from the comfort of the hot shower.\n[1977-11-16 20:30:00] changing room | I took my backpack out of the locker and started putting in the things I’d used for swimming. First the goggles—I held them in my hand and looked at them carefully. Then the swimsuit, swim cap, towel, and finally the soap case. It was brand new, and it belonged to me—that gave me pleasure. The soap case had soft, rounded lines; its green color and faint scent set it apart from the other swimming items. It belonged to another world—one closely tied to Mom and the things in her cabinet: earrings, rings, perfume bottles, belt buckles, brooches, scarves, and veils. And Mom must have been completely unaware of this world’s existence; otherwise, she would never have bought me that girl’s swim cap. Because a girl’s swim cap belongs precisely to that other world. And everyone knows you must never mix things from one world with things from another.\n[1977-11-16 20:40:00] changing room | Karl Larsdal beside me was nearly dressed. I stood up and put on my underpants, then searched for my thermal long underwear, first pulling one leg in, then the other. I pulled the pants up to my waist, turned around, and began searching through my clothes for my socks. I found only one, so I rummaged through the pile again. It wasn’t there. Angrily, I turned the whole pile upside down, tossing each item into the air. No, no, no. I desperately hoped to see the sock fall down and lie before me on the floor. But it was nowhere to be found.\n[1977-11-16 20:45:00] changing room | I saw that he was already dressed, sitting on the bench across from me, watching me. He bent down, looking under the bench. He crouched and searched beneath all the benches, while I went back into the shower room, thinking maybe the sock had accidentally gotten wrapped in the towel and slipped out along the way. But it wasn’t there either. Karl Larsdal said, “What’s wrong?” I said, “I can’t find the other sock. Did you see it?” He said, “Not here.” I said, “But it must be lying somewhere else. Can you help me look? Please!” Oh no! I heard my voice tremble slightly. But Karl Larsdal didn’t seem to notice—or perhaps he just pretended not to hear.\n[1977-11-16 20:50:00] changing room | I rushed back and dumped everything from my bag onto the floor. Nothing. No sock. I said, “It’s not under there?” Karl Larsdal said, “No, but we’ve got to go, Grete Lundnes. The bus will be here soon.” I said, “I have to find the sock first.” He said, “But it’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Can’t you just wear your shoes barefoot?” Maybe the sock was packed into the backpack together with the swimwear, and I just didn’t notice?\n[1977-11-16 20:55:00] changing room / shower room | I didn’t answer him. I shook out all my clothes once more, squatted down to check under every bench, then went into the shower room again. I saw him hold his watch up in front of me. He nodded and began idly wandering around, scanning the floor with his eyes. I put on my T-shirt and sweater. Karl Larsdal said, “Now we really have to leave—if I miss this bus, they’ll yell at me.” I said, “Can you keep looking while I get dressed?”",

    "text": "[1977-11-16 21:00:00] changing room | I stood on the bench and peered inside. Nothing. I put on my pants and fleece-lined trousers, zipped up my jacket, sat down, and tied my shoelaces. Karl Larsdal said, “Now we have to go.” I said, “I’m coming. Wait outside.” Could it be on the top shelf?\n[1977-11-16 21:05:00] changing room / shower room | After he left, I quickly ran back into the shower room. I looked into the trash can, felt along the windowsill with my hand, even opened the door leading to the hall. But nothing.\n[1977-11-16 21:10:00] outdoors | When I stepped outside, I saw Karl Larsdal standing by the little hill. Before I could catch up, he had already started running downhill. I hopped after him, entering the dark area below, passing the grayish trees, until I reached the lit path further down. With every step, my bare foot rubbed against the rough fur lining inside the boot. I shouted, “Wait for me, hey!” But he didn’t stop, not once turning his head back. My sock is lost, a voice inside me said. My sock is lost, my sock is lost.\n[1977-11-16 21:15:00] outdoors | At the same time, a ticking sound began in my head. As I ran, a sound ticked away inside my skull, somewhere behind my left temple—tick, tick, it went. Though it was unsettling—sounding as if something had come loose, or as if something inside was scraping against something else—I couldn’t tell anyone, because they’d only say I had a loose screw in my head and then make fun of me. Tick, tick, tick. Tick, tick, tick.\n[1977-11-16 21:20:00] candy shop | I kept running behind Karl Larsdal all the way down to the little shop that sold candies and pastries, the one we often went to, walking out with bags full of sweets—this was always the highlight of our trip. Karl Larsdal stood outside the store, impatiently shifting his weight from one foot to the other. I stopped in front of him. The snowplow had pushed snow up along the roadside, so the ground where we stood was more than half a meter higher than usual. This new vantage point changed our perception of the shop. It gave the place a cellar-like feeling, and that altered everything. The shelves were just 'shelves,' the goods merely 'goods,' arranged in an utterly ordinary room inside a house. In short, the shop was just an ordinary 'shop.' But at the time, I didn't understand this. The thought suddenly entered my mind, then vanished just as quickly as it had come.\n[1977-11-16 21:25:00] candy shop | I saw Karl Larsdal open the door and walk in. I followed right after. I saw the shopkeeper inside put down her newspaper, step into the store, and take her place behind the counter. I said, \"We don't have much time, do we?\" He said, \"No, the bus leaves in eleven minutes.\" Her face wore a bored, even contemptuous expression. She was an old woman, unpleasant to look at; on a mole on her lower jaw grew three long, gray hairs.\n[1977-11-16 21:30:00] candy shop | I saw one wall covered with pipes and pipe cleaners of various shapes and colors, rolling papers and cigarette rollers, tobacco tins, cigarette packs, cigar boxes, and snuff containers, each package bearing different fonts and tiny illustrations—dogs, foxes, horses, sailing ships, race cars, grinning black men, smoking sailors, and casually posed women. The candy shelf that both of us now stared at occupied the opposite wall. Unlike the tobacco products, these candies had no packaging; chocolates, hard candies, and gummy sweets were displayed in transparent plastic containers, showing themselves openly. There were no pictures between us and them: what we saw was exactly what we would get. Black candies tasted like salt or licorice, yellow ones were lemon-flavored, orange-red ones tasted of mandarin, red ones of strawberry, brown ones of chocolate. The small square chocolates were called \"recruits\"—they had a hard chocolate shell surrounding firm caramel, matching their shape. Heart-shaped chocolates contained soft, jelly-like fillings that tasted of apricot, just as expected. With few exceptions, we tried to figure out the correspondence between colors and flavors of the candies and gummies. Some black candies tasted like dark green ones, while some dark green candies tasted like green lozenges or eucalyptus oil—not the kind of flavor one would expect from green candy when seeing its color. Their taste was milder. Some black candies tasted like the anise-flavored \"King Baywick\" candies, the orange-marmalade-colored kind. Strangest of all, they never worked the other way around: the orange-marmalade-colored \"King Baywick\" candies never tasted like black candies, nor had we ever encountered eucalyptus-green candies that tasted like green or black ones.\n[1977-11-16 21:35:00] candy shop | Karl Larsdal took out the money he intended to spend, placed it on the glass counter, then bent forward to get a better view of the candies. Clearly, he felt tense due to the time pressure. He pointed at different jars as he spoke. I saw the shopkeeper pick up an empty paper bag and turn toward the shelf. The shopkeeper asked, \"What would you like?\" Karl Larsdal said, \"Uh... uh...\" I said, \"You've got to hurry!\" So he rushed through it. \"Three of these, three of these, and three of these, plus four of these, one of these, and one of these.\" The shopkeeper said, \"Three...?\"\n[1977-11-16 21:40:00] candy shop / outdoor stairs | When we stepped out of the shop holding our little paper bags, only five minutes remained before the bus left. We talked to each other as we ran toward the stairs. Snow on the steps had been trampled into slippery ice, so we had to hold onto the railing, but that prevented us from moving as fast as we wanted. \"Green ones. Or maybe four. Then three red-and-white ones. You know, polka dots... And five pacifier candies...\" he said. We reassured each other, \"There's enough time.\" The city lay beneath us. The white streets, lit by streetlamps, looked almost yellow. At the station, incoming and outgoing buses moved slowly, gliding like sleds over the snow, and there was the red-brick cathedral with its green spire. Above it all stretched the black sky, studded with twinkling stars.\n[1977-11-16 21:45:00] outdoor stairs | I saw Karl Larsdal let go of the railing and start running downward. On the last few steps, he lost control. The only chance to keep his balance was to rush through the final stretch as fast as possible. He charged down at top speed. Then he changed tactics, trying to slide the rest of the way, but his upper body was still moving too fast, so he pitched forward and crashed straight into the snowplow parked at the roadside. \"Hahaha!\" Only ten to fifteen steps remained. It all happened in an instant—I hadn't even started laughing yet when he was already lying there.\n[1977-11-16 21:50:00] outdoor stairs | I saw him lie motionless. I hurried down the last few steps and stood beside him. At first he gasped briefly. Then suddenly came a long, hollow groan. He shot me a brief, gloomy glance. He began breathing rapidly again. He nodded, sat up, and could breathe normally. Tears welled up in his eyes. He whispered, \"Satan, Satan. Satan. Satan.\" I said, \"I really wish you wouldn't curse like that.\" I said, \"Did it hurt?\" \"Could you not breathe?\" Was he seriously hurt?\n[1977-11-16 21:55:00] outdoor stairs / station | He shifted his body sideways, trying to stand up, his face twisted in pain. We saw our bus start up, pull onto the road, and disappear around the corner. I said, \"Now we definitely won't make the bus.\" He said, \"I couldn't breathe—that's why. I wasn't crying.\" I asked, \"Can you walk?\" He said, \"Yeah, I can.\" From the entrance of the Alnøna shopping center, we saw our bus start up, pull onto the road, and vanish around the corner. The next bus would come in half an hour.\n[1977-11-16 22:00:00] station | We walked into the station and sat down on a bench beside the photo booth, eating our candies. Karl Larsdal popped a red-and-white candy into his mouth. He raised his eyebrows at me. I said, \"What color does it taste like?\" He said, \"Red and white, of course! It's a red-and-white candy!\" There weren't many people around. Two young guys bought hamburgers and fries, their car parked outside. A drunk man sat on the floor, head drooping forward, asleep. And a girl's friend was working at the newsstand.\n[1977-11-16 22:05:00] station | I said, \"But what you taste isn't necessarily what it looks like—for example, this candy I'm eating might taste like a green one?\" He said, \"What are you even talking about now?\" I said, \"Say, for instance, it tastes like jam.\" \"Jam?\" \"You don't get it at all, do you?\" I said, \"We can't possibly know whether the flavors match the colors!\"\n[1977-11-16 22:10:00] station | After Dalson and I put our black candy pieces into our mouths, we looked at each other. We said exactly the same thing: It tastes like the green candy! Solvi said to Dad, \"Think about it—this lobster is one you caught yourself. It really does taste good.\" Grandmother said, \"Truly delicious.\" Dad said, \"There's nothing more delicious than lobster, but we don't know whether it tastes the same to all of us.\" Later that autumn, we had a gathering at our house. Grandmother, Grandfather, Marivik, Grandfather's brother Alf, and his wife Solvi all came. We ate shrimp, crab, and one large lobster that Dad had accidentally caught in his fishing net a few days earlier. But he still didn't understand. I wasn't sure I understood it either.\n[1977-11-16 22:15:00] station | Solvi stared at him. \"What do you mean by that?\" Dad said, \"I know how it tastes to me, but I don't know how it tastes to you.\" Solvi said, \"It tastes like lobster, obviously!\" Dad asked, \"How can you be sure the lobster tastes the same to me as it does to you? Maybe to me, lobster tastes just like jam.\" Everyone laughed. I didn't know why they were laughing. What they said seemed right. But I laughed too.\n[1977-11-16 22:20:00] station | Solvi seemed about to say something, then held back, looking down at the lobster, then at Dad. Then she shook her head. She said, \"I don't get it—the lobster is right there. We're tasting lobster, not jam!\" The others started laughing again. I knew Dad was right, but I didn't know why. I sat there for a long time thinking about it. I felt like I was always on the verge of understanding, but just as I was about to grasp it completely, it slipped away. The whole thing was too complicated for me to fully comprehend.\n[1977-11-16 22:30:00] station | While I was thinking this, I glanced toward the door—and just then it opened. It was Andersson. When he saw us, his face lit up. He walked over and sat down beside us. He said, \"Hi.\" Karl Larsdal said, \"Hi.\" I said, \"Hi.\" He said, \"You missed the bus, didn't you?\" This was even more mysterious to Karl Larsdal.\n[1977-11-16 22:35:00] station | Karl Larsdal waved his hand and held out the paper bag. Andersson smiled and took a pacifier-shaped candy. Then I had to give him one too. He said, \"Have some?\" What exactly was Karl Larsdal doing? We didn't even have that much candy to begin with.",

    "text": "[1977-11-16 22:45:00] on the bus | When the bus arrived, he sat in the seat in front of me and Karl Larsdal. We kept talking until we were nearly out of the mountain road. Then he turned forward and stayed that way for the rest of the ride. Karl Larsdal and I also sat silently. Andersson was in a higher grade than us. He trained in gymnastics in town three times a week. He had competed in national competitions, but unlike Snorri—who acted superior after competing nationally in swimming—he didn't think much of it. Andersson was kind, in fact, the kindest person I knew. Then the matter of the lost socks hit me again, stronger and more intensely than before.\n[1977-11-16 22:50:00] on the bus | Oh no, no. What will happen? What will happen? Oh no, no, please no. No, no, no! Maybe he already noticed we came home late. Maybe he'll be waiting for us in the hallway. But perhaps he hasn't noticed at all—he might be busy with something else. Then I'd be safe; if only I could slip quietly through the corridor into the basement room, everything would be fine, because there are other socks hanging there—I could just switch into a new pair.\n[1977-11-16 23:00:00] on the bus | Karl Larsdal always liked being the first to pull the stop cord, and now he reached out and grabbed it, even though we were the only ones getting off here. The bus stopped at the lowest point beneath the hill. The bus drove onto the bridge, wind lashing against the body. The windows rattled. I always felt a bit guilty getting off there, because the bus had to start up again and climb several hundred meters uphill before regaining its original speed. This guilt was so strong that I usually wouldn't get off until the next stop—by the Rockehaug Supermarket up ahead—especially when I was riding alone. Now, even though the sock issue burned in my mind, when Karl Larsdal pulled the cord and the bus swayed and slowed down just for us, I still felt a sharp pang inside.\n[1977-11-16 23:05:00] outdoors | We stood near the snowplow, waiting until the bus started moving again. Andersson raised his hand to wave goodbye. Then we crossed the road and walked up the path toward the residential area above.\n[1977-11-16 23:10:00] hallway at home | I didn't stamp my feet. I only brushed the snow from my trouser legs, carefully opened the door, slipped in, and closed it behind me. His office door opened—I heard it—then the door leading into the hallway opened. He stood before me. I stumbled slightly. He said, \"You're late.\" I said, \"Yes, sorry, but Karl Larsdal fell on the way, so we missed the bus.\" Usually I would stamp my feet on the stone slab outside the door to shake off the snow and mud from my boots, then use the brush leaning against the wall to sweep the snow from my trouser legs—but this time, I didn't stamp. Maybe he heard it. But what difference would it make?\n[1977-11-16 23:15:00] hallway at home | I began untying the shoelaces on the foot that was wearing a sock. I took off my shoe and placed it neatly against the wall. I looked up at him. Standing there with one shoe on and trying to walk across the floor was out of the question. Neither could I just stand still, motionless, waiting for him to leave—because he wouldn't leave. I slowly continued untying the laces. After unwrapping my scarf and placing it beside the shoe, once the laces were undone and I pulled my foot free, I picked up the scarf and casually draped it over my bare foot. He said: \"What's wrong?\" I said: \"Nothing, nothing at all.\" He shows no sign of leaving. My heart is pounding inside my chest. While doing this, an idea came to me.\n[1977-11-16 23:16:00] hallway at home | Still standing there with the scarf half-covering my bare foot, I got up. I looked down at my foot. Gave him a brief glance. Then lowered my eyes again. Dad said: \"Where's your sock?\" I said: \"I couldn't find it.\" He said: \"You lost your sock?\" I said: \"Yes.\"\n[1977-11-16 23:17:00] hallway at home | I saw him staring straight at me, then violently grabbed my arm and slammed me against the wall. He shook me. Then let go. \"You lost your sock?\" \"Yes!\" I shouted. \"How old are you? Do you think we're rich? Do you think we have money to buy new clothes every time you lose something?\" \"No,\" I said, looking down at the floor, tears welling up in my eyes. The next moment.\n[1977-11-16 23:18:00] hallway at home | He grabbed my ear and twisted it hard. He said: \"You goddamn brat! You need to take care of your things!\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"No more trips to the swimming pool. Understand?\" I said: \"Huh?\" He said: \"You're not going to the swimming pool anymore!\" I said: \"But...\" I started sobbing. \"No buts!\"\n[1977-11-16 23:20:00] hallway at home / bedroom | He released my ear and walked toward the door. Turned around to face me. He said: \"You're not old enough. Tonight has proven that. You're not allowed to go anymore. Understand?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Alright. Go upstairs to your room. No dinner for you tonight. You can go straight to bed.\"\n[1977-11-23 18:00:00] home / swimming pool | So when the next week came, I acted as if nothing had happened, packed my things, and got on the bus with Karl Larsdal and Dalson. I didn’t go to the swimming pool the second week, but I missed it so much. But in the end, everything turned out fine—when I came home, things were as usual, and he never mentioned again that I wasn’t supposed to go to swim practice. A small fear would occasionally spread through me, but a voice inside me said it would be alright.\n[1977-12-03 14:00:00] bathroom | I quickly wiped myself clean, flushed the toilet, pulled up my pants, opened the bathroom window, and stuck my head out. I heard the sound of Dad’s car turning into the driveway and stopping. What followed wasn’t the familiar sound of the front door opening and closing, but instead, the ring of the doorbell. Early December, three days before my birthday, two days before Mom was due to come home, while I was sitting on the toilet having a bowel movement. What’s going on?\n[1977-12-03 14:05:00] doorway / driveway | I dressed as fast as I could and went outside. He secured my skis and poles onto the roof rack, placing them beside a long, brand-new pair of Splitkein wooden skis. He said: \"Hurry up! We’re going skiing!\" I said: \"You bought new skis?\" He said: \"Yeah, aren’t they great? Now we can ski together.\" I saw Dad standing below me, wearing new ski clothes. On his legs were breeches and blue long socks, and on his feet, brand-new blue-and-white ski boots—everything was completely new.\n[1977-12-03 14:10:00] inside the car | I got into the car and sat beside him. He didn’t say anything until he started the engine and drove off. I said: \"Great, so where are we going to ski?\" He said: \"We’ll take a trip along the outer island, to Hove.\" \"Are there ski trails there?\" \"There are!\" he said. \"That’s where the best ski trails are.\" He said: \"Let’s go!\" I was a bit doubtful, but I said nothing. He looked like a stranger in his new clothes, and then we drove off toward Hove.\n[1977-12-03 14:30:00] Hove | He drove through a place that looked like a military camp, past rocky cliffs rising above the sea like concrete bunkers, past pebble beaches near the edge of the woods, and past charming little huts nestled among low shrubs. He left it all behind, driving down a narrow forest path that ended at a small sand pit, where he stopped the car. There were several red houses and wartime barracks—like a shooting range, though I’d heard rumors it used to be an airport. It was a place we often played during our afternoons on May 17th National Day, climbing onto roofs and entering the rooms of those buildings.\n[1977-12-03 14:40:00] Hove | He took the skis down from the roof of the car, then pulled out a small box packed tightly with various ski waxing tools he had bought. We applied blue Swix ski wax to the skis. He had read the instructions on the back of a tube, which claimed it was the best wax available. He clearly wasn't familiar with how to use the bindings properly, so it took him longer than me to fasten his ski boots onto the skis. Then he slipped his hands into the straps at the top of the ski poles. Instead of threading his hand up through the bottom of the loop and placing the strap around his wrist—a method that keeps the pole from slipping away even if you lose grip—he simply slid his hand straight into the loop. I could have taken my hand out and put it back in correctly, demonstrating the right way; if he had noticed, he would have known what to do. Only children who don’t know how to use ski poles hold them like that! It was painful just watching him, but I couldn’t say anything.",

    "text": "[1977-12-03 14:50:00] ski trail | I saw that he didn’t look at me, but instead gazed up toward the small ridge above the sandpit. As he moved forward, I noticed his skis weren’t gliding—they dragged along. His motion resembled his usual walking gait: short, unsteady steps, clumsy and stiff. Worse still, he staggered as he went, awkwardly jabbing his poles into the snow every few seconds just to keep from falling. I heard him say: “Well, let’s get started!” Although I’d never seen him ski before, not even in my wildest imagination could I have pictured that he actually couldn’t ski at all. But he really couldn’t.\n[1977-12-03 15:00:00] ski trail | When we reached the top of the ridge… and began to glide down the slope, I saw he was still the same as before. Sometimes he stopped and smiled at me. I stayed behind him, keeping my distance. From there, we could see the sea between the trees, its gray waves crested with foam. I thought maybe this was just the beginning—he might soon find his rhythm. I felt such sorrow for him that I wanted to cry out loud. Poor Dad. At the same time, I felt embarrassed—my father couldn’t ski. If anyone passed by, they wouldn’t think we were together. To them, he’d just be a stranger, a tourist. I was out here on my own, a local, someone who knew how to ski.\n[1977-12-03 15:10:00] ski trail | I saw the trail dive back into the woods, the ocean disappearing from view. Yet I still heard the murmur of the sea lingering among the trees, rising and falling, and I could still smell the salt and the ever-present scent of rotting seaweed, mingling with other forest smells to form the faint aroma of winter—a curious blend of decay within the snow and a mild breath beneath it—perhaps the most noticeable of all.\n[1977-12-03 15:20:00] ski trail | I saw him stop and lean on his ski poles. I stopped beside him. He looked at me. I heard him say: “Do you ski well?” I said: “Pretty well, don’t you think?” He said: “Yes. Well then, shall we continue? We’ll need to head back soon—we’ve got dinner to make. Why don’t you go ahead?” I saw a ship pass along the horizon. The sky above us was pale gray. The two lighthouses outside Torungen were bathed in a faint golden-gray light, marking the sun’s position.\n[1977-12-03 15:30:00] ski trail | A few meters ahead, I slowed down and began moving forward slowly, in an uneven way—but not nearly as clumsy as he was. I said: “Don’t you want to go first?” He said: “No, you go ahead. I’ll follow behind.” I felt the new arrangement forced me to completely overturn everything in my mind, reshuffling it all. If he followed behind me, he’d see exactly how I skied—and realize how utterly inadequate his own technique was. With every stride forward, I could feel his eyes on me. They cut sharply into my awareness. Worse still, if he noticed I was imitating his style, it would be even more unbearable.\n[1977-12-03 15:40:00] ski trail | We slowly shuffled through slushy snow. On the final short slope, after gliding a few meters forward, I pretended to lose balance and fell hard onto the ground beside the trail. I got up as quickly as I could and stood brushing snow and mud off my pants just as he passed by. I heard him say: “The key is to control your legs.” I saw white slush splattering across the pebble beach. Wind lifted snowflakes from the stones or somewhere else into the air. A seagull glided overhead, wings motionless.\n[1977-12-03 16:00:00] inside the car / driveway | We drove home in silence. When the car finally turned into the driveway in front of our house, I felt a sense of relief—our skiing trip was finally over. We stood wordlessly on the walkway, taking off our ski clothes. But as he opened the door to the staircase leading inside, I saw him turn toward me. I heard him say: “Come keep me company while I make dinner.”\n[1977-12-03 16:10:00] living room | I nodded and followed him upstairs. In the living room, I saw him stop and stare at the wall. My shake of surprise must have been utterly genuine, because he shifted his attention away from me, bent down, and reached out with his finger to rub at the stain. I heard him say, 'My God, what happened here? Have you ever seen this before?' I had completely forgotten about the orange juice stain. Not even with his wildest imagination could he guess that it was precisely me—who had been there, in the hallway outside the kitchen, spilling orange juice on the floor.\n[1977-12-03 16:20:00] kitchen | I saw him straighten up again and walk into the kitchen. I sat down on my usual stool. He took a bag of green cod from the fridge and placed it on the counter. From the cupboard, he fetched flour, salt, and pepper, sprinkled them onto a plate, and began coating the soft, slippery fish fillets. I watched him slice off a piece of butter and push it into the frying pan with his fingers. I heard him say: “Tomorrow after school, we’ll go into town to buy your birthday present.” He didn’t look at me as he spoke. I said: “I’m coming too? Then it won’t be a secret?” He said: “You already know what you want, don’t you? A jersey, right?” I said: “Yes.” He said: “Then you’d better come along—to try it on, so we can see if it fits.”\n[1977-12-04 15:00:00] sports store | I walked into the sports store and didn't see this jersey on the racks. I looked at the Everton jersey. I stared at Dad. I saw he was getting impatient, glancing around several times. I pulled the jersey over my sweater and held the shorts in front of me, pretending to try them on. I watched Dad take the jersey to the counter to pay. While they were wrapping it for him, Dad counted bills from his thick wallet, pushed his hair back, and gazed out at the road. I said, \"Can't we ask someone who works here? Maybe they have some in the storeroom?\" Dad said, \"If it's not hanging here, they don't have it. Pick something else from the rest.\" I said, \"But I want Liverpool's.\" He said, \"Well, take Everton then—they're from the same city.\" I said, \"This one's pretty good too.\" Dad said, \"Then that's settled.\" The streets were crowded with holiday shoppers, three weeks before Christmas. I wanted a Liverpool jersey.\n[1977-12-06 07:00:00] bedroom / bathroom | I woke up at dawn. I tore open the wrapping paper, took out the clothes, and pressed them against my nose. I put on the shiny jersey, then the shorts, and finally the white socks. Then I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror, turning my body back and forth. I thought about how the bag that wrapped the jersey was still in my closet, and I couldn't wait to wear it. Is there anything in the world that smells better than new clothes? The shorts felt a bit rough, rubbing against my skin. But it felt good—this wasn't a Liverpool jersey, but it was fine. Both teams came from the same city.\n[1977-12-06 07:05:00] bathroom | I saw Dad suddenly push the bathroom door open. He looked at me. He grabbed my arm and shoved me into the room. I heard him say, \"What the hell are you doing, boy?\" He shouted, \"You opened your present! Opened it yourself?\" He said, \"Now wrap it back up again! Right now!\"\n[1977-12-06 07:10:00] bedroom | Crying, I took off the jersey, folded it as neatly as possible, put it back in the wrapping paper, and sealed it with the small piece of tape left on the paper. I saw Dad watching my every move. As soon as I finished, he snatched the package from my hands and walked out. I heard him say, \"I should've taken it from you earlier, but now I'll have to hide it until the moment you're supposed to get it. It's your birthday today.\"\n[1977-12-06 08:00:00] bedroom / kitchen | I lay in bed crying until the others got up. When I walked into the kitchen, I heard Mom wish me happy birthday, saw her putting the round buns she'd baked the night before into the oven to warm, and boiling eggs. I knew this day was important—that today I would finally wear it. I hadn't expected to receive more gifts when we had cake in the afternoon. He couldn't possibly understand that. I was right, not him. This was my jersey! Today it would become mine! But I didn't care—my hatred toward Dad overshadowed everything.",

    "text": "[1977-12-06 16:00:00] living room | In the afternoon we ate cake and drank juice. I sat sullen and silent, eating a piece of cake without enthusiasm. I saw Dad place the birthday gift in front of me with a smile, but I just lowered my eyes and unwrapped the Everton jersey without showing any sign of joy. I heard Mom say, \"It's beautiful—don't you want to try it on?\" I said, \"No need—I tried it on at the store. It fits.\" Dad said, \"Put it on, let Mom and Henrik Inge see.\" I said, \"Don't want to.\" I thought about how they never let me invite guests on my birthday—and it was the same this time. Dad acted as if nothing had happened that morning, as if everything could just start fresh again.\n[1977-12-06 16:10:00] living room / bathroom | I saw him glaring at me. I took the clothes into the bathroom, changed into them, and came back out. I heard Dad say, \"Fantastic! I bet you'll be the toughest player at football training this winter.\" I said, \"Can I take it off now?\"\n[1977-12-06 16:15:00] living room | I saw him hand me a small square box—probably a cassette tape. I opened it. Inside was a brand-new cassette. Wings' *Back to the Egg* album. I looked at him. He was looking out the window. I heard Dad say, \"This is mine to give, after we've finished all the other presents.\" He said, \"Do you like it?\" I said, \"Yeah, yes! It's the new Wings album! I'm going to play it right away!\"\n[1977-12-06 16:20:00] living room | I unwrapped it. It was a folding stool. Four wooden legs connected by a mesh seat. I heard him say, \"Wait, you still have a few more gifts.\" Mom said, \"Here's my little present—just something useful for your room.\" Henrik Inge said, \"A stool.\" I said, \"Thank you so much—I can sit on it when I read!\"\n[1977-12-06 16:25:00] living room | It was a book on playing guitar. I looked at him, my eyes filling with tears. I heard Henrik Inge say, \"Now comes my present.\" I said, \"Really? What did you find for me?\" I said, \"Thank you so much.\" He said, \"It's got solos, scales, and everything—all very simple. Just press down where the black dots are. You'll figure it out.\"\n[1977-12-06 16:30:00] bedroom | I spent the rest of the evening listening to the tape of 'Back into the Egg.' Henrik Inge came in, and together we found an introduction—it was a recording from the radio. I heard that Ola Valdal, the drummer of Led Zeppelin, also played on one of the tracks. He read in the newspaper that a priest from Leivik participated in the opening part of one of the songs. That should appear early on the album.\n[1977-12-06 17:00:00] bedroom | I heard Henrik Inge say, 'There it is!' I said, 'Play it again!' Then I heard it too. Now let's try appreciating this piece from the perspective of the New Testament—a frail, raspy old man's voice. Think about it: whether Paul McCartney, Helen Ingrid, Danny Lane, Steve Holly, or Lawrence Juber, none of them knew what he was saying, but Henrik Inge and I understood, because we were from Leivik—and that made us feel dizzy, wonderfully so.\n[1977-12-31 10:00:00] at home | I know Dad usually stays in good spirits throughout Christmas, even in the mornings. By New Year's Eve, the shops finally reopened, and Mom went into town to buy food and fireworks. I think this must have been difficult for her—she probably didn't see the need to spend hundreds of kroner on rocket launchers, as Dad always did. This time, she was in charge of buying the fireworks, and Dad had completely stepped back from the task.\n[1977-12-31 11:00:00] at home | I felt things weren't going well. Dad would usually show us the rocket launchers he'd bought and boast that this year we'd beat Oskar Magnus... As night fell, I could picture him standing outside on the glistening snow, agile and careful, preparing the launch on the snow-covered lawn... My mind kept circling back to why Dad had stepped down. But whatever the reason, I knew it would bring great changes. No, not just a guess—I *knew* it.\n[1977-12-31 23:30:00] living room / balcony | It left me utterly speechless. I saw Dad smirk with quiet satisfaction. Still, he followed Henrik Inge and me outside. He stood beside us on the balcony at the back of the house—the place where we were supposed to launch the rockets. I heard Mom say it might be time to go out and set off the fireworks. I said, 'Fireworks? We only have one? Just one rocket?' 'Yes,' Mom said, 'Isn't that enough? It's a big one. The shopkeeper said it's the largest and best they have.'\n[1977-12-31 23:40:00] balcony | I saw her stick it into a bottle, but the bottle was too small—the rocket and the bottle both toppled over. She straightened them up and looked around. I saw Dad standing silent. Mom said, 'We need something to support it, or we can't launch it.' The rocket really was huge. I saw her light-colored leather coat hanging open, the zippers of her tall boots undone underneath, flapping open and shut as she moved, making her look like something sprouting from a strange root. Around her neck was a thick, rust-brown scarf.\n[1977-12-31 23:50:00] balcony | I saw Mom fetch it and prop it up in the snow. She leaned the rocket against it, but as soon as she saw it wouldn't stay upright, she immediately grabbed it with her hand and held it steady. I heard Henrik Inge say, 'Dad usually uses the clothesline pole for support.' Mom said, 'That's right!' I saw the wooden clothesline stand, used only in summer, leaning against the wall. All around us, people had started setting off fireworks—they whistled upward and burst across the sky. I thought there must actually be far more fireworks than we could see, since the sky was full of clouds and mist. Those trembling starbursts and all the brilliant colors and intricate patterns became nothing more than flickering, shimmering lights.\n[1977-12-31 23:55:00] balcony | I saw Mom do as he suggested. She pulled a lighter from her pocket, crouched down, shielded the small flame with her hand, and twisted her whole body aside, as if ready to leap away at any moment. The instant the fuse caught fire, she ran back toward us. I heard Henrik Inge say, 'If you lean it against the side, that’s how Dad usually does it.' Dad said, 'It’s midnight now—aren’t you going to launch our rocket?' Mom said, 'I will.'\n[1978-01-01 00:00:00] balcony | I heard her say, 'Happy New Year!' Henrik Inge said, 'Happy New Year!'\n[1978-01-01 00:05:00] balcony | I stayed silent, because at the rocket, I saw the flame on the fuse sputter forward, then come a muffled hissing sound. Then the flame died, and the sound stopped. I said, 'Ah, no—it didn’t ignite! It fizzled out! We only had one. Why did you only buy one? How could you do this?' Dad said, 'It’s New Year’s Eve—maybe next year I should be in charge of the fireworks?'\n[1978-01-01 00:10:00] balcony / indoors | As we left the place where fireworks were being set off, stepping into the warm interior amid neighbors' joyful shouts and the crackling bursts of fireworks. I felt such sorrow for Mom, a feeling I had never experienced before. I realized that what was most heartbreaking was that Mom had already done everything she possibly could. In fact, she couldn't have done any better.\n[1978-01-15 15:00:00] Tjerna | I stood beside Tjerna below, joining nearly all the children from the housing area. We each had numbers pinned to our chests and would all receive medals, but first, we had to wait in weather so bitterly cold it pierced right through us. When my turn came, my skis kept sliding backward; I could never really pick up speed, and ended up finishing last. As soon as I reached the finish line, I got my medal and began skiing toward home. Two weeks later, one afternoon, my feet were completely numb with cold. The Folke movement, a children's organization affiliated with the Labour Party, was holding a ski race.\n[1978-01-15 16:00:00] outdoors / doorstep | My skis scraped and slid forward. On the steepest part of the hill, I couldn’t even manage the diagonal stride anymore—I had to sidestep upward instead. Leaning on my poles, I crossed the road, entered the driveway, unfastened my skis, leaned them against the wall of the house, opened the door and stepped inside. I stopped still. I saw darkness hanging between the spruce trees, cold gnawing at the trunks... The road finally appeared, the streetlights came on, casting a glowing ribbon down the slope, and our house lay on the other side.",

    "text": "[1978-01-15 16:10:00] doorstep | I caught the smell, heard voices speaking in the kitchen upstairs! What is that smell? Grandmother’s? Is it really her here? No, don’t be foolish—it can’t be. Maybe Dad went to Vesfjord and brought the scent back? No, I fucking refuse to believe it.\n[1978-01-15 16:20:00] hallway / basement / stairs | I quickly kicked off my shoes, noticing my socks were wet—couldn’t go inside wearing those, they’d notice. I jogged down the hallway into the basement room, where a fresh pair hung drying on the clothesline. I put them on and hurried up the stairs as fast as I could, then paused.\n[1978-01-15 16:25:00] kitchen | I heard Dad say: \"Is that you, boy?\" I said: \"It's me.\" He said: \"Come up here a moment!\" The smell upstairs was stronger now. There was no doubt—Grandmother was here.\n[1978-01-15 16:30:00] kitchen | I walked into the kitchen. I saw Grandmother sitting there! I rushed over and hugged her tightly. She laughed and ruffled my hair. She said: \"You've grown so big!\" I said: \"What are you doing here? Where’s your car? Where’s Grandfather?\"\n[1978-01-15 16:35:00] kitchen | I heard her say: \"I came by bus.\" I said: \"By bus?\" She said: \"Yes. My son is managing alone with the children—I thought, well, I should come see and lend a hand, shouldn’t I? Look, I’ve already prepared dinner for you.\"\n[1978-01-15 16:40:00] kitchen | I saw her smile. I hugged her again. I asked: \"How long will you stay?\" She said: \"Well… hmm, I think I’ll have to leave tomorrow. Grandfather needs looking after too, you know. He can’t be left alone for too long.\" I said: \"No, please don’t go.\"\n[1978-01-15 16:45:00] kitchen | I saw Grandmother lean forward, lift her handbag, and take out a small package, handing it to me. I heard Dad say: \"Alright, alright, go to your room until I call you for dinner.\" Grandmother said: \"But he must take his gift first.\" I said: \"Right, thank you so much for the Christmas present—it’s wonderful.\"\n[1978-01-15 16:50:00] kitchen | I tore open the wrapping paper.\n[1978-01-15 16:51:00] Grandfather's kitchen | I saw a Start cup. It was white, with the Start team logo printed on one side, and on the other side a football player wearing a golden jersey and black shorts. I gave Grandma another hug. I said, \"Ah, a Start team cup!\"\n[1978-01-15 18:00:00] Grandfather's kitchen / bedroom | I knew they were sitting in the kitchen, talking quietly. I closed the door but left a crack open, through which I could hear them. The conversation would sometimes pause... then resume again... He called us, and we ate dinner... Sometimes he would agree with Grandma, then look away... I felt something strange about Grandma being there. I had almost never seen her without Grandpa, and I had almost never seen her alone with Dad. I felt he was like a different person—sometimes drawing close to us, and at other times deliberately keeping his distance.\n[1978-01-16 20:00:00] bedroom | I saw her leave. She gave Henrik Inge and me a hug, then Dad drove her to the long-distance bus station in town. I played 'Rubber Soul,' took a biography of Marie Curie, and lay down. Then the second song came on, 'Leivik's Forest.' I lifted my eyes from the page and lay flat, staring at the ceiling. I kept reading Marie Curie’s biography until ten o'clock, when I turned off the light. Suddenly the door swung open, and the ceiling light turned on. I felt the indescribable atmosphere from the music plant joy deep within me, lifting me up into its own world above. It was an incredibly beautiful feeling—not just because of the melody, but because it contained something else... I once had a girl... On the way to sleep, I found everything around me in the room expanding like pictures, emerging from nowhere I could guess, yet I willingly embraced them.\n[1978-01-16 22:00:00] bedroom | I saw it was Dad. Dad turned off the light and closed the door, saying nothing more. He said, \"How many apples did you eat today?\" I said, \"One.\" He said, \"Are you sure? Grandma said she gave you an apple.\" I said, \"Really?\" He said, \"But you also ate an apple after dinner. Remember?\" I said, \"Oh no! I completely forgot!\"\n[1978-01-17 16:30:00] kitchen | The next afternoon he stopped me. I walked into the kitchen. He handed me an apple. I glanced quickly at him. Our eyes met—his gaze was stern. I sat down and began eating the apple. When I finished, he gave me another. I heard him say, \"Sit down, I'll give you an apple.\" I said, \"Thank you.\" He said, \"Sit here and eat it.\"\n[1978-01-17 16:40:00] kitchen | I nodded, took the apple, and ate it. He handed me another. I heard him say, \"Another one.\" I said, \"Thank you, but I'm only allowed one apple a day.\" He said, \"Yesterday you got two, didn't you?\" He said, \"One more—this is your lucky day.\" I said, \"I'm full.\" He said, \"Eat your apple.\" I wondered where he got these apples from. Was there a bag behind him or something?\n[1978-01-17 17:00:00] kitchen | I ate it, though much slower than the first two. Dad handed me another. I tried to take a bite, but couldn't swallow. He watched me. Then he picked up the remaining half-apple and threw it into the trash can under the sink. I said, \"I can't eat anymore.\" Dad said, \"Eat it—you love apples so much.\" I said, \"I can't take it.\" He said, \"You can go to your room now. But I hope you've learned your lesson.\" Chunks of apple piled atop the food from dinner—I could feel the cold mush of apple in my stomach. Each swallow churned my gut, and I had to gulp repeatedly to keep from vomiting. He stood right behind me; there was no way to fool him. I swallowed apples with tears, swallowed tears with apples.\n[1978-01-17 17:30:00] bedroom | In my room, there was really only one thing I longed for—becoming an adult. I hated Dad, but I was in his power, with no escape. Only in the world of cherished thoughts and dreams could I destroy him. In that world, I could become an adult... I could place my hand on his cheek and squeeze tight... I could clench my fist and punch him hard in the nose... Kill him. I could press him against the wall, throw him down the stairs. I always fantasized like this, but whenever I was in the same room with him, it all vanished... He forced my will to submit to his, as if mine meant nothing.\n[1978-03-01 10:00:00] bedroom | I listened mostly to The Beatles and 'Wings,' and also to Henrik Inge's tapes—mostly band and solo artist recordings for a long time... By the time I reached adolescence, the music he listened to began to change... I realized this must be why I unconsciously transformed the interior of my room into a vast outer world. While reading, I was always wandering in outer realms... I existed in all foreign countries... I existed in the Stone Age... And in times yet to come. Music opened up this room, bringing its own atmosphere and aura, along with powerful emotions that deeply moved me.\n[1978-05-10 14:00:00] Henrik Inge's room / Bedroom | One day in early May, Dad was going out for a few hours, and with the front door left open, Henrik Inge had the chance to lead him into his room. We sat down to play guitar and listen to records. A while later, I heard them knock on my door—Henrik Inge wanted to introduce me to Bård. I knew he was beginning to connect with people who shared his interest in music, and especially those who played guitar. One of them was Thomaslund.",

    "text": "[1978-05-10 14:10:00] Bedroom | I was lying on the bed reading when they came in, and I got up. Henrik Inge loosened the thumbtack, took down the poster, and turned it over. \"Look here,\" said Henrik Inge, \"can you guess what's on the back?\" Bård shook his head. \"Check this out,\" he said, \"Berit Lars! He's put Elvis right in front!\" Both of them laughed. \"Can I buy it from you?\" Bård asked. \"It's mine.\" \"But you've hung it completely backwards!\" Bård said, laughing again. \"No, I haven't,\" I said, \"this is Elvis, it's him!\" \"Elvis is nobody!\" Bård said. \"No, Elvis Costello is someone,\" said Henrik Inge. \"Yeah, that's true,\" said Bård. The poster of Elvis I'd pinned to the wall above my desk.\n[1978-05-10 15:00:00] Bedroom / Outdoors | After they left, I examined both sides of the poster. Every spring we did this outdoors: cut birch branches, tied bottles to upright stumps, then collected the bottles the next day, drinking the thick, clear, sweet sap inside. We cut willow branches and made flutes from their bark. I thought Berit Lars looked so ugly, while Elvis was so handsome. Why would I put the ugly one in front and hide the beautiful one at the back?\n[1978-05-15 10:00:00] Woods / Basement laundry room | I dragged Karl Larsdal deep into the woods... We each picked a large bunch of anemones and raced back home. When I entered, I saw Dad standing in the basement laundry room. He turned toward me, every movement charged with anger. He reached out, took the flowers, and threw them into the largest sink. I said, \"I picked you a bouquet of flowers.\" I heard him say, \"Only little girls pick flowers.\" Light filtered through the leaves, and the moss glowed with a soft green light. Picking a large bunch of white anemones and giving them to our mother. Yes, in truth, this was no longer something appropriate for our age group, but it was a ritual, a gesture of love for Mom. I know a place where anemones grow thick and white, spreading like snow across the ground. While picking them, I often feel guilty—flowers are alive, and by plucking them, I kill them. But still, it feels good, because flowers help us spread joy to others.\n[1978-05-15 11:00:00] At home | One day, when some of his colleagues visited the house, they saw me standing on the stairs—fair-haired, long-haired, wearing red tights because it was winter. One colleague said, \"What a beautiful girl you have.\" Dad replied, \"It's a boy.\" I felt he was right. He was probably already ashamed of me. He smiled then, but based on what I know of him, I could tell it upset him deeply. I cared a lot about how I dressed; I would cry if I didn’t get the shoes I wanted, I would cry if it was too cold during our boat trips, yes, I would even cry whenever he raised his voice. And in situations where he really needed to raise his voice, he must have thought: What kind of son have I ended up with?\n[1978-08-15 18:00:00] At home | I was the spoiled son of my mother—he kept telling me that. It was true. After summer ended, I would start fifth grade, and it would be Dad’s turn. He was going to Baysang, living in a student housing complex called Fantoft, studying Leivik literature to become a senior teacher. I miss her. Nothing could make me happier than knowing Mom would move back home by the end of this month.\n[1978-08-20 18:00:00] Dining room / Driveway | I followed them outside to say goodbye on the driveway. I watched him put his luggage into the car’s trunk, then sit in the passenger seat—Mom was driving him to the airport. She sat beside him, started the engine, and began reversing. I waved; Dad lifted his hand slightly, and then they drove away. I heard him say, \"Sorry I can't come home every weekend—maybe once a month.\" I said, \"That's too bad.\" This was one of the strangest scenes I’d ever seen. Dad should never be sitting in a Volkswagen Beetle—that much was certain. And if he absolutely had to be in one, he certainly shouldn’t be in the passenger seat. That looked downright ridiculous. Dad wasn’t just a passenger—that was beyond doubt.\n[1978-08-20 18:00:00] At home / Henrik Inge's room | I found one of his records, put it on the turntable, and turned the volume up to maximum. I chose Magazine’s 'Secondhand Daylight.' What should I do now? Go to the tool shed, saw wood, hammer nails, do all the rough carpentry I usually do? Go to the kitchen and bake pancakes? Fry an egg? Make tea? Sit in the living room with my feet on the table? No—I knew exactly what I wanted. Go to Henrik Inge’s room.\n[1978-08-20 18:40:00] Living room / Kitchen | I turned the volume almost to the maximum, left the door open, and walked into the living room. I closed my eyes and began swaying back and forth. After doing this for a while, I went into the kitchen, grabbed a chocolate bar lying there, and ate it. Then I started swaying again. I opened my eyes and gasped. I rushed into the room and immediately switched off the stereo. I heard Henrik Inge shouting from downstairs: \"What the hell are you doing up there?\" The bass sound made the walls tremble. Music rolled out of the room. It roared around me like thunder. I didn’t feel like myself—I felt more like part of the house, like the dining table or a painting on the wall. As if I were swallowing the music, letting it enter my body and become part of me, especially when my eyes were closed. Then someone called from below. Had they forgotten something and come back to get it?\n[1978-08-20 18:45:00] Stairs / Henrik Inge's room | I heard him climbing the stairs. Behind him followed another boy. I had never seen him before. I said, \"Nothing, I borrowed one of your records.\" \"Are you completely out of your mind?\" Henrik Inge said. \"You'll blow the speakers! They're definitely ruined now. You damn idiot!\" \"I didn't know,\" I said. \"Sorry. A thousand times sorry.\" The other boy laughed. \"This is Thomas Linddal,\" said Henrik Inge. \"And that's my stupid little brother.\" \"Hi, little bro,\" said Thomas Linddal. \"Hi,\" I said. Ah. Thank goodness. Maybe he’s from the volleyball team?\n[1978-08-20 18:50:00] Henrik Inge's room / living room | I saw Henrik Inge walk into the room, turn the volume up a little more, and press his head close to the speaker. Henrik Inge closed the door; I stood there for a while in the living room until I saw Marianne and Lilund outside, pushing a baby stroller. I went out and ran after them. \"Good thing it didn't shake loose,\" he said, straightening up. \"Lucky for you. If it had broken, you'd have to buy me a new one. I'd make sure you did it too.\" He looked at me. \"How long have they been gone?\" I shrugged. \"Half an hour,\" I said.\n[1978-08-20 19:00:00] on the road | \"Can we walk together?\" I said. \"Sure,\" they said. \"Where are you going?\" \"Up that way.\" \"To whose place?\" I shrugged. \"Whose kid is it?\" \"The Leonardsens' kid.\" \"How much do you earn?\" \"Five kroner.\" \"What are you saving for?\" \"Nothing special. Maybe a coat.\" \"I'm going to buy myself a new jacket,\" I said, \"a black Matinique. Have you seen that style?\" \"No.\" \"The sleeves are wide, made of a different material than the rest—kind of like corrugated paper. And there's a strip down the front covering the whole zipper. What kind of coat do you want?\"\n[1978-08-20 19:10:00] on the road | Marianne shrugged. \"I think, a coat.\" \"A coat? A light-colored one?\" \"Maybe. A shorter one.\" \"You're the only boy who talks about clothes.\" Lilund said. \"I know,\" I said. This was a trick I'd recently figured out. Talking with girls was so hard. You either took their hats or yelled insults behind their backs, and then the conversation ended. Maybe you could talk about homework. There was nothing else to say. Then suddenly I realized it: clothes—this was an interesting topic. You could talk endlessly about it.\n[1978-08-20 19:30:00] Yenhaug Supermarket / playground / football field / Karl Larsdal's house | When I got near Yenhaug Supermarket, I said goodbye to them, ran down the cliff to the playground, where no one was, climbed the grassy slope to the shipwreck site, also empty, then walked to the football field, still deserted, so I climbed over Presbakkmo's yard fence and came to the front of their house, where I rang the doorbell. But Karl Larsdal was having dinner, and afterward he was going up to Vemd. Ah well.",

    "text": "[1978-08-20 19:45:00] on the road / floating dock | I ran down the hill, but his bicycle was gone—they must have already left. I began slowly walking down toward the floating dock. The road was also completely empty. There were many clouds in the sky, not so hot anymore; surely no one would be at Naben. It was Sunday, dinnertime. Children were either eating, playing with friends outside, or out with their parents. Suddenly it flashed through my mind: Henrik Inge has visitors! Maybe I could sit in his room and stay with them? What else could I do? It would probably be empty there too, but if there was nowhere else to go, I could go look at the boats and breathe in that special smell of fiberglass, wood, gasoline, and saltwater.\n[1978-08-20 20:00:00] floating dock | I quietly joined the group. The boat owners were sitting on their boat decks, spitting into the water while listening to those standing on shore—people without boats, but who were soon getting one. I stood among this crowd. There was a large gathering of people. No. But owning a boat wasn’t my dream—it was too unrealistic, just as unrealistic as waking up the next morning in the Viking Age, like the boy in a book I’d read. No, if I had any dream object, it would be a brand-new pair of white tennis shoes with a light blue Nike logo, like the ones Henrik Inge had, or a pair of light blue Levi’s jeans, or a light blue Catalina jacket. Or maybe a new pair of Puma sneakers, an Admiral tracksuit, an Umbro shorts, or a Speedo swimsuit. The black-and-white Adidas Olympia shoes were what I wanted most. I also wanted shin guards, a Puma bag, Atomic Atom alpine skis and slalom ski boots for winter, an alpine ski pants, and a real down jacket. Splitkein fiberglass skis with new bindings. Light-colored Sami boots, the kind with slightly upturned toes. A new white shirt, a red sweater. I’d rather have white rubber boots instead of the dark blue ones I was wearing now. I also wanted a pale red coral necklace I once saw, or white would do too. I wasn’t very interested in boats, motorcycles, or cars. But since I couldn’t tell anyone that, I still had some favorite brands. Boats: the ten-foot With Dromedille with a five-horsepower Yamaha engine. Motorcycles: Suzuki. Cars: BMW. These brands all started with unusual letters: Y, Z, W. For the same reason, I was also drawn to 'Wolverhampton,' my first supported team, even though Liverpool later replaced it. Wolves still thrilled me—their stadium called Molineux, their emblem a black wolf on an orange background. How could I not love them?\n[1978-08-20 20:15:00] floating dock | In one of Henrik Inge's football magazines, I read a comparison between Kevin Keegan and Kenny Dalglish, who was his substitute. I constantly thought about trousers, jackets, sweaters, shoes, and sports gear because I wanted to look good, I wanted to win. When the tennis player Jenssen—who I thought was the best of them all—after a referee's call gave a fierce glare, angrily locking eyes with the referee while throwing the ball onto the grass, I desperately thought, no, don’t do it, don’t do this, it’ll be terrible, you can afford to lose this point, don’t do it! But he did—he launched into a furious tirade at the referee and even slammed his racket hard onto the ground, sending it flying several meters away. I could hardly bear such scenes. I loved him so much that every time he lost a match, I cried and couldn’t stay indoors—I had to go outside, onto the road, where I sat by the roadside, weeping bitterly over the loss. It was the same with Liverpool. If they lost the Football Cup final, I’d go outside, tears streaming down my face. My favorite player in that team was Emlyn Hughes—he was my man. Of course, I liked a few others too, especially Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan, but only before Keegan moved to Hamburg and Newcastle. It was a very specific comparison—they were similar in many ways, yet each had their own personal style and shortcomings. The comparison was roughly fair. But one thing mentioned in the magazine unsettled me deeply: Kevin Keegan was extroverted, Kenny Dalglish introverted.\n[1978-08-20 20:20:00] floating dock | Just seeing the word 'introverted' filled me with despair. Was I introverted? Wasn’t I? Didn’t I cry more often than laugh? Didn’t I always stay in my room reading? That must be introversion. Introverted, introverted—I didn’t want to be an introverted person. That was the last thing I wanted. It was the worst. But I was introverted—that idea spread rapidly through my mind like cancer cells. Kenny Dalglish also always stayed alone. Ah, so did I! But I didn’t want to! I wanted to be extroverted! Extroverted!\n[1978-08-20 21:20:00] In the woods / At home door | An hour later, I returned to the path through the woods, wanting to climb a tree to see how far I could see. The moment I stepped onto the path, I saw Mom’s Volkswagen Beetle driving up the hill. I waved, but she didn’t see me. I ran after her car as fast as I could, up the slope, across the small lawn, and reached the house just as she was stepping out, slinging her handbag over her shoulder and opening the front door. \"Hi,\" she said. \"Would you like to help me bake bread?\"\n[1978-09-01 10:00:00] Baysang / Iceland (memory) | By chance, during a summer in the early nineties, I visited him. He was drunk, and I told him I would move to Iceland that winter. \"Iceland,\" he said, \"I've been there once—Reykjavik.\" \"You haven't been there, have you?\" I said. \"When did you go?\" \"Back when I lived in Baysang, remember?\" he said. \"I had a girlfriend there—she was Icelandic—we went together.\" \"While you were still with Mom?\" \"Yes. I was thirty-five, living in a student town.\" \"You don’t need to justify yourself. You can do what you want.\" \"Okay, thanks, son.\" This might have been the year he began escaping his father's control. Many years later, he would say he started drinking in Baysang. \"I couldn't sleep,\" he said, \"so every night before lying down, I'd have a little drink.\" Later he had a girlfriend in Baysang.\n[1978-09-15 10:00:00] home | Of course, back then we didn't know anything, nor did we have enough experience to imagine such a scene. What mattered most to me was that he was no longer at home. Although the house was no longer a confined space and for the first time I could do as I pleased inside it, he still existed in some strange way. Whenever I walked into the hallway with muddy feet, spilled food on the dining table during meals, or let pear juice drip from my chin while eating, I would think of him—as if struck by lightning. 'Can't you eat a pear properly without making such a mess, boy?' I heard his voice speaking.",

    "text": "[1978-10-01 10:00:00] school | That autumn, when I started fifth grade, I became deeply attracted to almost all the girls... This year a senior female teacher, Miss Horst, joined us and taught several subjects. She enjoyed having us do role-playing exercises. She often arranged short dramatic scenes, and I always volunteered—this was my favorite activity... I made Miss Horst laugh so hard that tears streamed down her face. If I did well on an exam, I wanted to share the good news with him rather than with Mom—that felt different. At the same time, everything happening outside was slowly changing in nature, becoming both better and worse. It was as if within that gentle, mild world of childhood, even the blows that came were soft and harmless... But now they were sharp and clear; doubts had vanished... Something else was unfolding before me, but this something else wasn’t personally related to me... It belonged to people of the outside world. Yet I didn’t feel much difference between them. Something inside me encouraged me, enabling me to approach them. I didn’t know then that this was a grave mistake—yes, perhaps the greatest mistake a boy could make. To be noticed by everyone, yet become someone else. I had a special talent: playing girls. I was good at it. Sweeping my hair behind my ears, pursing my lips into a cherry-like pout, swaying my hips when walking, speaking in a more sentimental tone than usual.\n[1978-10-15 19:00:00] residential area | One evening, I stayed over with Karin Ingrid. I suggested we go to Miss Horst’s house. \"Good idea,\" he said, \"but my bike tire is flat. You can't walk that road.\" \"Let's hitchhike,\" I said. \"OK.\" He also liked performing and excelled academically; his appearance resembled mine somewhat—two substitute teachers couldn't tell us apart and thought we were twins. She lived about three kilometers east of the residential area.\n[1978-10-15 19:15:00] intersection / inside car | We went down to the intersection and stood by the roadside. The first car passing that evening stopped. Two young men. We got in. We told them where we were going. He stepped on the gas, the car accelerated sharply, and our bodies pressed against the seats. At the intersection, the car suddenly braked hard. The driver turned toward us. \"Where are you headed?\" \"Who lives up there anyway?\" \"Miss Horst,\" Karin Ingrid said, \"she's our schoolteacher.\" \"Ah-ha!\" said the man sitting next to the driver. \"You're going to play a prank? We used to do that when we were kids. Run over to the teacher's place and cause some trouble.\" \"No, we're not causing trouble,\" I said. \"We just want to visit her.\" He turned and looked at me. \"Visit her? Why? To ask about homework or something?\" \"No… no,\" I said, \"we just wanted to come.\" \"Well then, get out, kid,\" said the driver. They had the music turned up loud—the bass made the windows vibrate. Over the past year, I had frequently hitchhiked here, usually with Marivik·Kristian, going to Hof or up to Roligheden or somewhere else, but never had it taken more than an hour before we found a ride. He turned his head back. For the rest of the ride, they didn't say another word.\n[1978-10-15 19:30:00] outside Miss Horst's house | I sincerely thanked them, as compensation. Karin Ingrid and I stepped onto the gravel path. We had never been inside this house, but we clearly knew its location. I pressed the doorbell. \"It's you?\" she exclaimed in surprise when opening the door. They roared off into the darkness. Towering plane trees stood along both sides of the road, stretching out their branches. Two cars were parked outside the house, and every room was brightly lit. I felt a bit guilty—I realized I had disappointed them, but lying wasn't right either.\n[1978-10-15 19:40:00] Miss Horst's living room | We went in. The living room was full of adults seated. Miss Horst introduced us, and we sat down on stools beside the table. She placed a plate with three cookies and a glass of juice in front of us. I tucked my hair behind my ears, pursed my lips, and began improvising. \"We thought maybe we could come see you,\" I said. \"Can we come in?\" Karin Ingrid asked. She hesitated. \"I'm sorry, I have guests, you understand. But you've come all this way just to see me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then come in! You can stay half an hour, if you'd like. I've got cakes too. You can try some. And some juice!\" She said we were her star pupils, excellent at performing. \"Could you give us a little performance right now?\" one person asked. Miss Horst looked at us. \"Sure,\" I said, \"will you join me?\" \"Of course,\" said Karin Ingrid. But the performance went fairly well—the audience laughed.\n[1978-12-20 19:00:00] carnival venue | When the performance ended, we bowed. Both Marivik·Kristian and I were dressed as women, fully made-up, wearing dresses and carrying handbags. My imitation was so convincing that no one recognized me—not even Dalson, who stood beside me for at least five minutes before suddenly realizing who this unfamiliar girl actually was. During the pre-Christmas carnival, I achieved another success. Our cheeks were slightly flushed, but we felt very pleased with ourselves because of the applause.\n[1978-12-28 14:00:00] ice rink / Mariann's house / school | We went ice skating together; she would sit on my lap and kiss me. I was invited to her birthday party—the only boy there. She sat on my lap while chatting with her girlfriends, and I held her close, and then we kissed and hugged... Finally, I persuaded Marivik·Kristian to tell her that I had broken up with her. On that day, I made a terrible mistake—she ran after me, and instinctively, when she reached the shelter, I stuck my foot out. She tripped and fell to the ground, her face hitting the gravel, bleeding, and she started crying. The prettiest and most outstanding of them was Mariann—we were together for two weeks... Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful girls at school, though not *the* most beautiful... She lived with her mother and sister in quite poor conditions. She almost never wore new clothes; her mother always tried her best to mend and alter old clothes handed down from relatives, striving to keep them neat and presentable. I never felt ashamed of dressing as a girl, nor embarrassed talking about girls—I even became close with several of them. But later I simply couldn't bear it anymore—being in her room, I felt emptiness; kissing her gave me claustrophobia, I just wanted to escape from there as fast as possible... But that wasn't the worst part. The worst was that she unleashed all her anger on me, and all the girls took her side, siding against me. For the following weeks, I was extremely unpopular.\n[1979-01-10 10:00:00] school | Sometimes the girls seemed to hate me—they thought I was no good—but at other times their attitude would do a complete turnaround, not only willing to talk to me, but even dancing with me during class parties—whether held at a student's home or at school. I explained that I hadn't meant any harm, that it was just for fun, but no one could understand.\n[1979-01-10 10:10:00] school | My feelings toward them were also contradictory—at least toward the girls in my class. On one hand, nearly five years of school life had given me considerable understanding of them, so I felt somewhat indifferent. But on the other hand, they were beginning to change—their bodies developing beneath their sweaters, taking on curves, their hips becoming fuller, their gait different, and they started paying attention to boys two or three grades above us.\n[1979-01-10 10:20:00] school | With our shrill, thin voices, we could only steal brief glances at them—girls whose qualities now filled us with awe, yet to whom we seemed like mere air. What was so special about girls that made them strut around so proudly? They knew so little about the world. How much did they really understand about men, women, and desire? Had they read Wilbur Smith’s books, where women are captured and raped beneath thunderous skies? Had they read Ken Follett, where a man shaves a woman's pubic hair while she lies with closed eyes in a foamy bathtub? Had they read Helen Sandnes’ *Insect Summer*? I can recite that scene word for word—him tearing off her panties in the hayloft. Had they ever looked at porn magazines? And what about music—what did they know? They only liked whatever everyone else liked—the Kids, those trashy top-ten hits. Music meant nothing to them; they had no idea what it truly was or what worlds it could build. They barely knew how to dress—otherwise they wouldn’t constantly show up at school in such bizarre outfits without even realizing it. So how dare they look down on me? I’ve read Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett, and Helen Sandnes. I’ve been looking at porn magazines for years. I listen to real bands and I know how to dress properly. How could I possibly be worse than them?",

    "text": "[1979-03-16 14:00:00] music classroom | Every Friday we held a class competition. Six students each brought a song, and everyone voted. I complained to Henrik Inge. To prove how knowledgeable and sophisticated I was about music, I tried to impress during music class. But my songs always came in last, no matter which band I played—Led Zeppelin, Queen, Wings, The Beatles, The Police, Jam, Skids—it was always the same: one or two votes, dead last. I knew they didn’t actually dislike the music—they were resisting me. In truth, they weren’t even listening. That infuriated me. He not only understood why I was angry—he also disliked the mainstream pop hits—but he came up with a plan to help me.\n[1979-03-23 14:00:00] music classroom | One Friday, I brought Aller Værste!'s debut album *Tired*, which Henrik Inge had bought just days earlier. I told them I had gotten an advance copy of the upcoming album by The Kids. The music teacher didn't see through my trick and played the first track from the record, which was hidden inside a white paper bag. I claimed the disc was too new for the cover art to be ready yet. Then I stood up and revealed that they hadn't been voting for The Kids, but for Aller Værste!—my eyes gleaming with triumph. I said: \"This proves they're not interested in music at all—other factors influenced their votes.\" The Kids' second album hadn’t even been released yet. To them, Aller Værste!'s music was unbearable—last time I played their single \"Clean Hands\" in class, they shouted \"Clean hands! Clean hands!\" and mocked me for days. But now, as the first notes rang out in the classroom, murmurs immediately spread through the room. Their excitement grew, peaking by the end of the song. It turned out that Aller Værste!, disguised as The Kids, had won. Ah, how furious they were! But they couldn’t say a thing. I’d really fooled them. Of course, I’d heard them say it—that I was arrogant, that I thought I was someone special, that I liked strange things no one else liked. But that wasn’t entirely true. I simply liked good music and disliked bad music—was that my fault?\n[1979-05-01 10:00:00] at home | I went through them all, and Henrik Inge played music for me. He taught me more guitar chords, and when he wasn’t home, I would stand there with the black Gibson pick and the black guitar strap, playing for myself. Thanks to Henrik Inge and his music magazines, I learned more and more about music—Magazine, Cure, Killers, Simple Minds, Skids, Stiff Little Fingers, XTC, and Leivik’s rock bands like Meat, Bluebird, Aller Værste!, Cut, Stavanger Ensemble, News, Concrete Hysteria, Destruction, and so on.\n[1979-06-01 10:00:00] at home / at Marivik Christian's house | Just to be safe, I bought a textbook on percussion, whittled two sticks with a knife, and arranged some books in a circle on the floor—one on cymbals to the left, another on snare drum beside it, and three more below on hand drums. The only person who joined me in these activities was Marivik Christian, with whom I spent more and more time. Most often, we sat at his place listening to records, trying to play his twelve-string guitar. He also came over to my house, where we would sit together reading our magazines—since my mom wasn’t so strict—and listen to my records, talking about girls or the band we were going to form, especially its name. He wanted to name the band \"Marivik Christian's Nameless Disciples,\" but I wanted to call it \"Clot.\" Actually, both names were equally good—we agreed on that point—and anyway, we didn’t need to decide now. We could wait until the time was right, until we actually had a chance to perform on stage, before settling the issue.\n[1980-02-15 20:00:00] class party | Winter passed, and so did our first class party, where we played Postman’s Knock and slow-danced, holding the girls—whom we’d known for five years—close as we circled the floor. We knew these girls so well, perhaps even better than our own sisters. When Ingeborg Lofnes pressed so close to me, my head nearly exploded. The scent of her hair, her shining eyes, alive with energy. And ah, those small breasts beneath the thin white shirt. Wasn’t this an incredible feeling? It was something entirely new—I’d never experienced it before in all these years. Now that I knew what it tasted like, I wanted to feel it again.\n[1980-03-27 07:00:00] kitchen | As usual, I walked into the kitchen in the dark and rain to prepare breakfast. Mom had already left for her early shift. I buttered a slice of bread, added a piece of sausage, and poured a glass of milk. Winter had passed and spring arrived, bringing light. Each day stretched a little longer toward night. Cold spring rains melted and sank the snow. One March morning... she forgot to turn off the radio. There had been an accident in the North Sea—a offshore oil rig had capsized and sunk. Even locked in my room, I could piece together what had happened overnight—the sound of the radio, though I couldn’t make out every word, carried an unusual dramatic intensity in its rising and falling tones.\n[1980-03-27 07:10:00] kitchen / Rockhaug Supermarket | Half an hour later, I arrived at Rockhaug Supermarket, pants rolled above my rubber boots, hood pulled tight over my head. Everyone was talking about nothing else. I saw rain slowly streaming down the glass windows. It pattered softly on the roof like a steady drumbeat, wrapping the building in a thin film. Water flowed continuously through the gutters. Up above, Oskar Magnus started his car, and the headlights flickered on. It was a disaster—missing people uncountable, no one knew the exact number. Everyone had friends, or friends of friends, whose fathers or brothers had been working on that rig. A man named Alexander Schjølberg apparently broke a leg. Was it hundred-year waves? A bomb? Or a structural failure?\n[1980-03-27 08:30:00] classroom | During the first lesson—though it was supposed to be math—the teacher spoke about the accident. He always urged us to pursue careers related to oil extraction. Oil was the future. Yet another voice emerged: the daily news predicted that oil reserves would soon run dry, consumed far faster than expected—within twenty-five years, all oil would be gone. I wondered what Granddad would say about this. I was fascinated by the number mentioned in the news—2004. It felt unreal, so distant, yet in the broadcast it was presented as serious reality, utterly unlike the years in sci-fi stories or magazines. It shocked me: would 2004 really come? Within our lifetimes?\n[1980-03-27 08:45:00] classroom | At the same time, the gloomy tone in their voices unsettled me deeply—it hinted that something terrible was coming, that everything would end. I didn’t like that. I wanted everything to keep going on forever. All endings frightened me. That’s why I hoped Jimmy Carter would be re-elected, and that Odvar Nordli and his Labour Party would win the next election. I liked Jimmy Carter. I liked Odvar Nordli, even though he always looked so exhausted. I didn’t like Mogens Glistrup or Olof Palme—they had an unpleasant slickness and falseness that showed in our words and glances. Einar Førde and Reiulf Steen were similar, though less obvious. But I liked Brundtland. I didn’t like Golda Meir or Menachem Begin, even though he signed the Camp David Accords. It was hard to judge Anwar Sadat. Brezhnev too, though for different reasons. I saw him standing there in a thick fur coat and large fur hat, his bushy eyebrows shadowing narrow eyes, mechanically waving down at the parade below, where rockets mounted on platforms rolled past one after another, surrounded by thousands of soldiers marching in perfect unison. I didn’t think he belonged to humanity—he seemed like another kind of being, impossible to relate to. Did I like Knut Henrik? In a way, yes—at least I fervently hoped his \"anti-inflation plan\" would work. I liked Hans Hammond Rosbach, but found Trygve Bratteli odd—his voice soft, almost whispering, his strange rolling 'r', his thin shoulders and skull-like head, with thick, dark eyebrows.\n[1980-03-27 09:00:00] classroom | The topic of the maritime disaster occupied us for a quarter of an hour, then class began as usual, which meant we started working on arithmetic problems from the textbook while the teacher walked between the desks, helping those who raised their hands with questions. Outdoors, the hand of darkness loosened its grip on the morning, and everything gradually became clearer. During break, someone said there might be air pockets beneath the oil drilling platform, allowing people inside to survive for several days.\n[1980-03-27 10:00:00] classroom | The next lesson was Leivik. When the female teacher sat down behind her desk, I raised my hand. \"Yes, Grete Lundnes?\" \"Have you graded our essays yet?\" \"You'll find out soon enough,\" she said. Others claimed that none of our schoolmates' parents were on that ship, but a boy from Roligheden had lost his father. It was hard to trace where all these rumors came from or how much truth they held.\n[1980-03-27 10:10:00] classroom | She must have reviewed the notebooks already, because next she wrote some vocabulary and grammar rules on the blackboard—likely errors taken from our assignments handed in last Thursday. It was true—she pulled out a thick stack of corrected notebooks from her backpack. I stared at the small pile, trying to spot my own among them. \"This time there were many well-written essays,\" she said, \"I really wanted to read them all aloud. But unfortunately, time doesn't allow it. So I've selected four. That doesn't mean these are necessarily the best—you understand. Everyone in the class wrote very well.\" It's not the top one, at least I'm sure of that.\n[1980-03-27 10:15:00] classroom | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes raise her hand. She was wearing a white knitted sweater. \"Yes?\" the teacher said. \"Can we knit while you're reading the essays?\" Ingeborg Lofnes asked. \"Of course, I don't think that would be a problem,\" the teacher replied. I think that sweater suits her perfectly. Her jet-black hair and dark shining eyes go so well with the white, as do her red lips and the blush that appears on her face when she gets warm.\n[1980-03-27 10:20:00] classroom | I saw four girls lean forward and pull out their knitting from their bags. I saw Karlsen smile, then flush slightly. \"Can we do homework instead?\" Karlsen said. Someone laughed. \"You need to raise your hand like everyone else, Karlsen,\" the female teacher said, \"but the answer is no, of course not.\" I don't think it was anger that made him react, but rather that he had spoken in front of everyone. He always blushes when he speaks in class.\n[1980-03-27 10:30:00] classroom | The teacher began reading the essays. The first wasn't mine. I stretched my legs under the desk. The second wasn't mine either. Nor was the third. I looked up anxiously as she picked up the fourth notebook. Three more left, I thought. I love early classes, when it’s still pitch-dark outside and we sit like in a bright capsule, all of us with messy hair and sleepy eyes, a bit dazed, but as time passes, we slowly wake up until finally everyone is running around wide-eyed, flailing arms, shouting loudly. Still not mine? Ah. She won’t read mine after all. Something sank inside me—I felt disappointed. But another emotion began to grow. My essay was the best, I knew that. And so did she. Yet again, just like last time, she hadn’t chosen to read mine. What good was writing well then? Next time I’ll write the worst, most terrible essay possible.\n[1980-03-27 10:50:00] classroom | Finally, she put down the poorly written essay. I raised my hand. She clapped her hands and nodded toward Karl Larsdal·B., who stood up and walked to the front. As the class monitor, he would distribute the notebooks. I quickly flipped through my essay from beginning to end. There was one mistake per page. \"Why didn’t you read mine?\" I said. \"Is it really that bad?\" For a moment, she narrowed her eyes, then opened them again and smiled. \"I received twenty-five essays. I can’t possibly read every single one—you understand that. I often read yours. Now it’s time for others to be heard.\" \"This time, they truly wrote quite well. How rich your imaginations are! I really enjoyed reading your work.\" In the end, she had written: \"Imaginative and fluent writing, Grete Lundnes, though perhaps the ending feels a bit abrupt? Few errors, but you need to put more effort into handwriting!\"\n[1980-03-27 10:55:00] classroom | In my essay, I had written 'Hotel,' and she circled the word in red, adding an extra 'l' beside it. I raised my hand, and she came over. \"There’s only one 'l' in this word. I know that. I’ve seen it in a book—I’m certain.\" We were supposed to write about the future. I wrote a story about space travel. I spent many pages describing the various training programs astronauts had to complete before launch. After ten pages, I still hadn’t reached the rocket launch. After some thought, I decided the mission would be canceled at the last moment due to some error, leaving the astronauts to return home empty-handed.\n[1980-03-27 10:58:00] classroom | I saw her lean toward me. Then she straightened up and returned to her desk. \"Ah, in a way, you’re right. But in English, 'Hotel' has only one 'l'. In Leivik, it should have two.\" \"But Hotel Phønix has only one 'l',\" I said, \"and it’s in Leivik. Right in Aucity.\" \"You’re correct.\" \"So it’s not actually a mistake then?\" \"Then it’s not a mistake. That settles it. Your essay was very well written, Grete Lundnes.\" I caught the scent of soap from her hands, and a faint trace of perfume from her neck. Her words warmed me, even though they were meant only for me.",

    "text": "[1980-03-27 11:15:00] gym locker room | After break ended, as we entered the indoor gymnasium, the wind blowing against the high walls of the building was so strong... I sat on the bench in the locker room, thinking about this as I undressed. I stood up naked, took my towel, and walked into the shower, already filled with steam. I found a spot among the boys whose pale skin looked almost like marble. Warm water poured down, first onto my head, then flowing continuously down my face and chest, my neck and back. Wet hair clung to my forehead; I closed my eyes. Outside, rain continued to fall, driven by wind. Trees beyond the school swayed, creaking and groaning... It sounded just like waves crashing. The metal grates of the ventilation system roared and gasped, and the whole building seemed alive—a giant beast hidden within rooms, corridors, and passageways, crouching beside the school, singing a lonely, mournful song to itself in despair. The sounds rose and fell, sometimes lingering briefly, now here, now there, as if playing a game. Perhaps it is the sound that is alive.\n[1980-03-27 11:20:00] shower room | I opened my eyes and saw Karin Ingrid pointing at Thor across from me. I saw Thor standing there laughing, his private part sticking straight up in the air. I heard someone shout, \"Thor's thing down there is standing up!\" I heard Karlsen exclaim in amazement. I knew Thor always liked wearing tight pants to show off his large member—it wasn't a secret in class.\n[1980-03-27 11:25:00] shower room / gymnasium | I saw Miss Hensel cleaning up inside the gymnasium. I heard Karin Ingrid suggest taking Thor to physical education teacher Miss Hensel. I heard Thor refusing, saying, \"No, don't do this!\" I saw Miss Hensel wearing her blue gymnastics outfit and white tights—everything perfectly neat. I knew she was from Oswick and spoke broken Leivik dialect. She was every student's nightmare.\n[1980-03-27 11:30:00] gymnasium | I saw Karin, Karlsen, Marivik, and Karl lift Thor up together. I followed behind them, watching as we all walked naked through the locker room into the gymnasium. I heard Karin Ingrid shout, \"Go! Two more people!\" I also heard Miss Hensel demand, \"What are you doing?\" I felt the gymnasium was chilly. I thought this scene was incredibly exciting—seeing Thor being carried by four people, resisting but not really trying hard to escape.\n[1980-03-27 11:35:00] gymnasium / locker room | I saw the boys hold Thor upright in front of the teacher, then quickly rush back to the locker room. As far as I knew, apart from telling them not to do it again, Miss Hensel didn’t react with the horror we had expected. I thought even though she didn’t scream, it was still a huge success—we’d successfully shown her Thor’s thing.\n[1980-03-27 12:00:00] locker room / classroom | I learned the incident blew up into something big—the four who carried Thor were kept after school. I heard that Thor actually became the winner in everyone’s eyes. I realized the principal and teachers labeled this as bullying, but I thought Thor actually benefited—he now had every girl knowing about his special feature.\n[1980-03-27 20:00:00] bathroom | I waited until after dinner when Mom sat down in the living room, then went to the kitchen, took a chair, and closed the bathroom door. I climbed onto the chair and looked into the mirror. I knew the only full-length mirror in the house was in the hallway, but I couldn’t stand naked there. I thought even if no one was home, I could be seen anytime in the hallway. I already had an excuse ready—if Mom asked about the chair, I’d say I needed it to place the tape recorder safely away from electricity.\n[1980-03-27 20:10:00] bathroom | I stood on the chair observing my body, held my private part to examine it, and looked from the side. I looked down at my thin, bony arms and flat chest. I remembered a photo taken during the Leivik Cup—I was so skinny my front nearly touched my back. I realized my thing wasn’t as big as Thor’s—it was more like a cork. I thought that because I’d slacked off training, I couldn’t even do a single push-up.\n[1980-03-27 20:20:00] bathroom | I climbed down from the chair, filled the bathtub with water. I ran back to my room, grabbed the tape player, placed it on the chair, then lay in the tub, closed my eyes as warm water flowed over my body. I sang out loud in the bathtub, singing Sting’s song: \"I feel so lonely, I feel so lonely.\" I felt the hot water stinging my skin. I heard music flowing from the player. I closed my eyes, dreaming of the day I’d become famous, imagining how girls would adore me then.\n[1980-03-27 20:40:00] bathroom / bedroom / living room | I turned off the player, changed into a light blue shirt and dark blue jeans. I walked up to Mom and stood before her. I asked Mom, \"When exactly are we going to buy my clothes for May 17th?\"\n[1980-03-27 20:45:00] living room | I heard Mom say it was still early before the end of March, but I suggested it might be cheaper now. She smiled and told me I’d naturally have new clothes and shoes by May 17th. I knew money was tight at home because Dad was still in school.\n[1980-05-10 10:00:00] Aucity (Aucity) | I knew May 17th was the most important day of spring. I knew that on this day, the island's school band would parade in yellow jacket uniforms, and the city streets would be packed with people waving national flags. I thought about how everyone would wear ribbons and hang out their flags, and my heart swelled with pride.\n[1980-05-17 08:00:00] Home / Tyholmen | I was wearing new jeans and crisp white tennis shoes. I saw students gathering at Roligheden School, and though it kept raining, I still felt full of anticipation. I saw that it was raining. I heard children around me blowing horns and trumpets. I felt the tense excitement in the air. I thought unhappily that the rain forced me to put on an ugly raincoat over my new clothes.\n[1980-05-17 09:30:00] In the parade | I saw the parade begin to move. I noticed a girl with light curly hair smiling at me, so I moved toward her. I slipped my flag under her shirt and flicked it upward. I heard the teacher start singing, and we joined in. I heard a band playing music from far away. I saw that although she shouted for me to stop, her eyes were smiling. I thought I must get another chance to tease her again.\n[1980-05-17 09:45:00] In the parade | I continued fiddling with her clothes. I saw the girl turn and smile again. I remembered the flag and quickly raised it high. I heard her shout, “Stop it! Don’t be so childish!” I remembered last year’s parade when Dad got angry because I let the flag droop. I noticed she didn’t have a southern accent—was she a visitor? I prayed she wasn’t just visiting, because I really wanted to see her again.\n[1980-05-17 10:00:00] Aucity streets | I saw Marivik glowing under the flashlights, his parents standing in the front row. I stared at the girl, watching her twist her body to keep her shirt from being lifted. In the sunlight, I saw she was wearing a pale rose-colored coat, blue shirt, and white tights. I looked at her full chest, and suddenly my stomach tightened with a sharp pain. I silently pleaded: Dear God, let me be with her.\n[1980-05-17 10:30:00] Phoenix Hotel Street | I saw Mom waving and taking photos on the street by the Phoenix Hotel, and Dad nodding at me. After the parade disbanded, I saw the girl disappear into the crowd. I heard Mom calling my name: “Hey, Grete Lundnes!”\n[1980-05-17 14:00:00] Hove | I spent the entire afternoon searching the crowd for the girl in the rose-colored coat. Every time I spotted a similar color, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. I saw little kids holding cans of cola, and everywhere there was lively festival energy. I knew the celebration was held in Hove, where there were sausage and ice cream stands. I also knew which class she was in. I thought that on this not-so-big island, I would eventually run into her. I didn’t dare ask directly for her name—I was afraid word would spread.",

    "text": "[1980-06-01 18:00:00] Home / Floating dock | I saw Dad pilot the 'Frogfish 17' gliding into the bay. Though he didn’t wave, I could sense his inner pride. I saw the shallow-draft boat swiftly skimming across the bay. I knew Dad had moved back home and was proud of completing his course. I also knew he had sold his stamps and tidied up the garden. I thought Dad looked most certain not as a passenger, but standing behind the steering wheel.\n[1980-06-01 18:15:00] Floating dock | I saw him slow the boat but still bump into the floating dock. Then he tossed the mooring line to Mom. He climbed ashore to inspect the boat, and finally we got into the car and headed home. I asked him, “Smooth ride?” He replied, “Couldn’t be better—you saw it yourself.”\n[1980-09-15 05:00:00] At sea / On the boat | Every morning I followed Dad to collect the nets. I stood at the bow, fists tucked in my pockets, watching Dad maneuvering behind the wheel. I felt the bone-chilling cold across the sea surface. I saw no one around—just quiet silence in the bay. I knew that this summer he had crashed the boat against the small skerries near Ylsta Island. I hunched my shoulders and hugged my arms, thinking it was simply too cold out on the water. I watched Dad, focused and intent at the helm.\n[1980-09-15 05:40:00] at sea / on the boat | I saw Dad steer the boat closer to shore. I tried to grab the slippery buoy, but my hands were too frozen to succeed. I saw Dad angrily back the boat up and try again. I heard Dad shout: 'You have to hurry up—it's just about pulling them in!' He called me an idiot. I cried and said, 'It's not easy to control.' He corrected my pronunciation: 'Styre!' I felt the seawater piercingly cold, and the wind kept blowing. I saw waves crashing against the hull, spraying foam. I could see anger flashing in his eyes. I wondered why this thing was so hard to grab.\n[1980-09-15 06:30:00] at sea / on the boat / laundry room | I saw him busy hauling in the fishing nets, fish leaping joyfully in the bucket. When we got home, I saw him cleaning guts in the laundry room while I put on my backpack and headed off to school. I saw the first light of dawn appear on the horizon. I felt the cold deeply penetrating my soul. I realized I hated my father, and on the way home we didn't exchange a single word.\n[1980-10-15 16:00:00] church basement | I saw Magna handling guitar and vocals, I played guitar, Viktor played bass, and Dalson played drums. I wrote our band name on my backpack. I learned that in autumn our band 'Bloodclot' was officially formed, named after my strong insistence. We practiced in the church basement.\n[1980-12-20 19:00:00] school gymnasium | I stood on the playground wearing ripped jeans, feeling a coolness I'd never felt before. I went to find Håvard from town and asked if we could perform there. I asked Håvard: 'Can you let us play at \"Legend Night\"?' I knew we performed 'Love the Teacher' at the Christmas party. Though our performance was mediocre and we disbanded quickly, I still intended to continue the duo with Marivik. I thought even if they accused us of not being able to play, standing on stage felt incredibly wonderful. I looked forward to a real breakthrough.\n[1981-01-15 20:00:00] home | I learned that Dad once mentioned in conversation that it was Mom who saved us. I knew he lacked proper self-awareness. I pondered whether, despite Mom’s protection, our long exposure to fear of Father had left indelible scars. Doubt filled my heart.\n[1981-02-15 14:00:00] Rocky hall outdoor field | After being substituted out in the second half, I lowered my head and walked toward the locker room. I saw the coach run over to comfort me. I smiled at him through my tears. The coach asked me: 'What's wrong? Just because I took you out?' I replied: 'Nothing, it's fine. Completely fine.' I felt tears welling in my eyes, not wanting anyone to see me cry. I thought although I was disappointed, I still tried hard to act okay in front of him.\n[1981-03-01 10:00:00] Skeie | I learned that the team trained and played home games in Skeie, where there was a large residential area. I knew most of my teammates lived there. I thought maybe the coach only kept me on the team out of pity, which made me feel somewhat discouraged. I realized I had many shortcomings compared to others.\n[1981-03-15 19:00:00] school auditorium | I performed a piece at the parents' meeting. I saw Marivik standing beside me, playing a twelve-string guitar. I tapped a small drum and introduced punk to the adults. I explained: 'People who do punk music want to express rebellion. Safety pins are their symbol.' I knew we were going to perform our own song, 'Step on the Upper Class.' I learned some of the adults present were barbers and cleaners. I gazed enthusiastically at the parents before me.\n[1981-03-15 19:10:00] school auditorium | I looked at the barbers and housewives in the audience. I sang loudly and beat the small drum according to my mood. I saw Marivik continuously playing beside me. I announced: 'Next, we'll perform our original song called \"Step on the Upper Class.\"' I knew I had frequently performed on stage during the past five years. I was twelve years old, and now I was a member of the band 'Bloodclot'.\n[1981-04-10 14:00:00] classroom / home | I sent an extremely secret letter to the television station. I saw classmates jeering when we performed in class. I heard our homeroom teacher Finsdahl say that Marivik had improved in guitar playing. I knew there was a TV program that allowed children to perform alongside their idols. Amid the class's boos, I felt the pain of defeat. I fantasized about singing onstage with Åge Aleksandersen, hoping this would make me a star.\n[1981-05-01 10:00:00] home / football field | I heard the coach say we might play a warm-up match. I know my uncle is friends with star player Dahl and once got my brother an autograph. I know Ståt is the champion team. I recall the feverish scene at the final game in the stadium. I think it would be extraordinary to play at Vesfjord Stadium—so many spectators and players would see me.\n[1981-05-15 10:00:00] home / football field | I think even though I'm currently the worst on the team, this is only temporary—my abilities will shine through eventually. I imagine myself dribbling past opponents and scoring from all positions in my mind. I wonder why I can't perform as well in warm-up matches as I do in training. I notice I’m still playing as center forward.\n[1981-06-05 18:00:00] Sjøna field | I was practicing kicking the ball on the field when I saw a group of kids swimming in the water. I saw branches casting shadows over the field. I saw the deep blue sky and green shade. I felt sweat running down my back, heard seagulls screeching and the distant hum of a lawnmower. I saw the brownish-yellow water of Tjønna. As I gasped for breath, I heard the faint sound of the football.\n[1981-06-05 18:30:00] Sjøna field | I had a pair of white shorts and Le Coq Sportif cleats, which I was carefully wiping and oiling. I turned them over and over in my hands, examining them closely. I know we’re entering the Leivik Cup next month, and our goal is to reach the final. I know next year I’ll be playing with boys one year younger than me. I feel joy pulsing in my chest. I think our team’s lead is now secure.\n[1981-06-05 19:00:00] Sjøna field | I saw four girls stop by the edge of the field. The girl wore blue jeans and a white T-shirt. After training ended, I handed out drinks and sat down on the grass. I know these boys are all one year older than me. I recognized her immediately. For the rest of the training session, I thought everything I did was for her—my attention never strayed from her.\n[1981-06-05 19:10:00] Sjøna field | I saw Lars and Einar call out to them, and then everyone burst into laughter. I asked cautiously, “You know them, right?” Lars replied, “Yeah, Kaja and Suvå. The other two are in HC class.” I thought that since they’re in the same grade, she must be either Kaja or Suvå.\n[1981-06-05 19:15:00] Sjøna field | I asked Lars, “What’s the name of the one on the far right? Kaja?” He answered, “Yeah, probably her.” I saw the orange-red rays of sunlight. I saw my teammate dunk his head into a bucket and fling off a sparkling spray of water droplets. The sun stung my eyes, making me squint. I pretended casually that I’d just 'seen her before' while trying to get information.\n[1981-06-05 19:20:00] Sjøna field | I felt Lars poke me in the chest. Lars looked at me and asked, “You like her? Want me to introduce you?” I stubbornly said, “No. I just thought I’d seen her before.” I know Lars has known her since childhood. I suddenly felt my mouth go dry, thinking I must not let him see through me.\n[1981-06-05 19:25:00] Sjøna field | I saw Kaja looking at me. I followed Lars toward the changing room. I tilted my head back and drank the green liquid he tossed to me. I weakly shook my head. Lars whispered, “Kaja’s nice. She has big breasts.” I asked, “Can I have some?” He asked if I wanted to go swimming, but I said I had to go home. When I noticed she was looking at me, my heart raced with panic. I felt Lars laughing at me.\n[1981-06-05 19:40:00] changing room / forest gravel path | I changed out of my T-shirt in the changing room, then biked home along the old gravel road. I saw the mountainsides exposed under the sunlight. I saw spruce trees standing like walls on both sides of the road. I felt the air suddenly turn cool in the shade. I saw clusters of tiny insects, forcing me to keep my mouth tightly shut. I know last year’s fire left the mountains bare.\n[1981-06-05 19:50:00] Old Gravel Road | I pedaled my old bicycle, seat and handlebars adjusted to their highest settings, speeding forward over the bumpy ground, the rear wheel occasionally skidding. I heard myself loudly singing The Beatles' 'Come Together,' though I wasn't sure whether the lyrics I heard were entirely correct. As I rushed down the hill, I felt an incomparable joy welling up inside me, and I thought it didn't really matter whether the lyrics were right or not.\n[1981-06-05 20:00:00] Spedemann / Fina Gas Station | I braked at the junction where the path met the road, waited for passing cars, then pedaled hard up the slope. I swallowed a few licorice candies and tried to cough them back up. Passing the gas station, I crossed to the other side of the road to avoid the crowd. I saw a group gathered around a table outside the Fina gas station, and I noticed Helen Ster, Tor, Winnie, and Marianne were among them. I told myself I wasn't afraid of them, but I truly disliked being scrutinized.",

    "text": "[1981-06-05 20:10:00] Forest Path | I jumped off my bike before the hill and pushed it up the ascending trail. Later, I climbed to the top of the slope and walked down the gentle incline, then got back on and rode onto the road. I saw dense broadleaf trees lush with green leaves and heard the chirping of birds. I saw the narrow path made of soil and bare rock, and massive tree roots and rotting fallen trunks stretching across the grassy banks of a stream. I felt the trees closing in behind me, as if entering a deep, mysterious world. I realized it wasn't the world that limited imagination, but imagination that limited the world. At that moment, I was immersed in the sense of freedom sparked by just one glance from Kaja.\n[1981-06-05 20:20:00] Below the Chapel / On the Road | I pushed my bicycle uphill past the chapel. I saw people playing ball in front of Magnus's house and Tom washing his car. I rode over the crest of the hill, and strong winds blew sand into my eyes. I saw the distant blue bay behind the green trees and the white gas tank. I smelled barbecue smoke drifting from Magnus's house and heard the music of Dr. Hook coming from Tom's car radio.\n[1981-06-05 20:30:00] Home | I saw two cars parked outside my house, went inside, and greeted relatives sitting in the living room. Anne handed me a bag of M&Ms, which I took as I headed toward the kitchen. I heard Anne laugh and say, 'I suppose you're too old for this kind of thing now?' I replied, 'People of any age can enjoy M&Ms.' I learned that the cars parked there belonged to Sven Nils’s Citroën and Dagney’s 2CV. I had completely forgotten they were coming, and seeing them filled me with a thrilling mix of joy and excitement.\n[1981-06-05 20:40:00] Living Room / Bedroom | I took the candy bag into my room, lay on the bed reading, watching the last rays of sunset cast across the walls. I heard Anne laughing at the writing on my back, and Mom explained it was the name of a football team. I told them, 'The name comes from a Viking-era name.' I saw the final streaks of sunlight projected onto the ceiling.\n[1981-06-15 10:00:00] Home | I knew that over the next two weeks, Kaja’s image would remain constantly in my mind. I could close my eyes and see her as she looked on May 17th, or lying naked on the grass. These images stirred a quiet ache inside me, and I fantasized about doing passionate things with her.\n[1981-06-15 11:00:00] Home / Outdoors | I sat at the dining table peeling fish skin or chewing ox lung. I leaped my bike off a hilltop, felt my feet skim the water’s surface, then plunged into the sea. I swam slowly upward through the water toward the surface. I felt the sun beating directly on my face, tasted salty seawater on my lips, and felt my body wrapped in churning waves. I remembered that summer when we first moved here—I was thirteen, Dad planted potatoes and raised chickens. I felt a deep surge of ecstasy and trembling within. I realized Kaja was like a dream or a star to me—though not far away in distance, the gap between our worlds felt vast and nearly impossible to cross.\n[1981-06-15 12:00:00] Tvet Old House (memory) | As far as I knew, Dad bought several chickens, but they all ran away within half a year. He enjoyed planting potatoes along the edge of the lawn and tending the compost pile—gardener was one of his dream jobs.\n[1981-06-19 19:00:00] Sjøna Field | I was playing football at Sjøna field. From the corner of my eye, I saw three people walking along the sideline. I felt the warm sun and the flat grass beneath me, though the center of the field was slightly uneven. I immediately recognized that one of the three was Kaja. I found that during the rest of the game, I spent nearly as much time looking at the spectators as I did watching the ball.\n[1981-06-19 19:30:00] Shena Court | After the match, I saw a girl walk up to me. I stared at the ground, blushing, unable to suppress a smile. I heard her ask, 'Do you know who Caesar is?' I replied, 'Yes.' She went on, 'Caesar wants to know if you'd like to be with her. Would you?' My heart racing, I answered, 'Yes.' I felt a wave of heat rush through my body; my longing was so intense it was as if my heart were on fire.\n[1981-06-19 19:35:00] Shena Court | I watched her walk back. I began pacing nervously along the edge of the court. I asked her, 'Where is she?' She replied, 'She's waiting by the changing room. We'll meet there later?' I answered, 'Okay.' I could hardly believe it. I silently thanked God. Then I started worrying about what I should say or do next.\n[1981-06-19 19:40:00] By the changing room | I saw Caesar standing by the roadside with two other girls, leaning on their bicycles. I walked toward her; when she smiled at me, I smiled back. I greeted her, 'Hi.' She said, 'Hi.' I told her, 'I'm going in to change clothes, then I'll come right out.' She nodded in agreement. I smelled the scent of fresh grass in the air and heard the pleasant chirping of birds. It was a warm, golden evening. I knew we had just won the match, and everyone inside the changing room was jubilant.\n[1981-06-19 19:50:00] Inside the changing room | Slowly, inside the makeshift changing room, I unstrapped my knee pads and gazed out the window at the lake. I unwound my bandages and rolled them up. Then I stood and pulled on my light-colored jeans. I heard Helen Ster call Jostein an idiot. The changing room was a simple shed, very rudimentary. I anxiously searched for decent words. I had considered using 'homework' as an excuse, but feared it would make me look worse. I wanted to announce to everyone that I was with Caesar, but I knew I’d never actually do it.\n[1981-06-19 19:55:00] Inside the changing room | I zipped up my Puma shoes, slung my bag over my shoulder, and walked out. I heard Jostein mock my pants and ask if my belt was designer. Helen Ster called me 'Fermi.' I shot back, 'What about you, damn daddy’s good boy.' Finally, I said goodbye to them. I knew my jeans were bought at the fashion store Interlude, and my belt was punk-style. I thought to myself that I was definitely not someone chasing trends. I felt irritated by Helen Ster’s provocation.\n[1981-06-19 20:00:00] Outside the changing room | I stopped in front of them, my eyes meeting Caesar’s. I lifted my leg and swung it over my bicycle. I said to her, 'Hi.' She replied, 'You guys played well.' I asked, 'Can I see you tomorrow?' She said, 'Sure, I’ll come by after school.' I asked if she knew where I lived, and she said she did—Tibaken. Then we said our goodbyes. I saw she was wearing a white T-shirt, and from this close distance, I noticed her breasts clearly outlined. I nervously swallowed. I kept thinking I needed to find some busy excuse, so I wouldn’t be caught off guard now. Knowing she wanted to be with me filled me with overwhelming joy.\n[1981-06-19 20:15:00] On the way home / Home balcony | I pedaled furiously until they were out of sight. When I got home, I saw my mother sitting at the camping table on the backyard balcony. I walked over and sat down. I asked my mom, 'Where’s Dad?' She said, 'He went fishing.' She asked how the game went, and I told her we won. I saw coffee on my mother’s table. I smelled a quiet, peaceful atmosphere around me. The joy of knowing she wanted to be with me felt absolutely incredible. But then anxiety crept in—I started wondering what I should do with her tomorrow.\n[1981-06-19 20:20:00] Home balcony | I sat on the balcony, looked up, and saw Marta also sitting in a deck chair. I saw Presbakkmo working in the vegetable garden. I noticed a moving white figure on the path and realized it was Freddy. Mom asked, 'Did something happen?' I said, 'No.' She asked, 'Is there something you want to ask me?' I said no again. I heard the sound of a radio coming from Presbakkmo’s house. I caught a whiff of barbecue smoke drifting over. I knew Freddy had albinism and was hunchbacked.\n[1981-06-19 20:30:00] Home balcony | I gasped, opened my eyes wide, rushed into the room and turned off the stereo. Then I went into the kitchen and ate a chocolate bar. I asked Mom, 'Do you know what exactly “Fermi” means?' Mom said it meant 'female.' Realizing my mistake, I quickly made an excuse: 'I almost came in with my training shoes on.' I heard Henrik Inge shouting from downstairs, asking what the hell I was doing. I felt the music vibrating through the walls, as if it had become part of the house itself. I was completely absorbed in the music, as if I had swallowed it whole. I’d mistaken the noise for Dad returning, which gave me a sudden fright.\n[1981-06-19 21:00:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw my brother come up the stairs, followed by Thomas. After he entered his room, he leaned close to the speaker to inspect it. Later, I went into his room to ask him for advice. I told my brother, 'Tonight I’m with Caesar.' He congratulated me. Awkwardly, I asked him what I should say to a girl. He laughed and reassured me, 'Don’t overthink it, and everything will be fine.' He introduced me to Thomas as 'the little idiot brother.' I had never seen the boy who followed my brother before. Thank goodness it wasn’t Dad who came back. I felt a helpless nervousness about the upcoming date.\n[1981-06-19 21:30:00] bedroom | I walked into my room. I put on a record of McCartney II, lay face down on the bed and rubbed against the mattress, humming a tune. I asked my brother what he was doing, and he said he was working on chemistry and geography homework. He said high school required reading a lot. I knew my brother had to study natural sciences as Dad wanted. I imagined whether Caesar might also be lying in bed thinking of me right now. At the thought of our relationship, I felt shivers running through my body.",

    "text": "[1981-06-20 18:00:00] Home / On the way | I paced by the window watching the road, and saw her riding up the hill on her bike. I put on my shoes and jacket and went outside. I saw her talking with my friends. I pushed my bicycle over. Karlsen shouted, 'She wants to know where you live.' I said to Caesar, 'Hi, easy to find?' She said no problem. I said, 'Shall we go?' She said okay. I saw my friends standing there leaning on their bikes. When I saw Caesar appear, I felt a breathless shock, and at the same time an immense pride at having such a beautiful girl. I sensed my friends were filled with jealousy toward me.\n[1981-06-20 18:10:00] On the way | I got on my bike, and she did too. On the uphill stretch, we both got off and walked. I waited for her to catch up, walking side by side on the gravel path. I heard the sound of my trouser legs rubbing together. I told her, 'Your jacket looks great—where did you buy it?' She thanked me and said it was from Bajazzo. I said goodbye to the four of them, 'See you!' I heard gusts of wind rustling through the trees. I saw her wearing low-heeled sandals and heard the sound of them tapping against the pavement.\n[1981-06-20 18:30:00] On the road / outside the store | I got on the bike and pedaled downhill, holding the handlebars with one hand and tilting toward her. We rode down to the small shop at the bottom, where we saw nobody around. I asked her, 'Do you know Lars?' She said yes. I suggested, 'We could go over to the shop.' I felt a breeze rushing past my ears. The shop door was shut tight, looking very empty. I stole glances at her moving chest, wondering if she noticed my gaze. I kept agonizing over whether I should kiss her now, or hold her hand.\n[1981-06-20 19:00:00] old gravel road / outside Caesar's house | We continued riding uphill until we reached the house where she lived. I stayed on my bike, ready to leave. I suggested riding in the direction of her house, and she agreed. She told me her parents were home, so I couldn't come in. I suggested meeting tomorrow, but she said she'd be going out on a boat, and we agreed to meet on Thursday. I felt the bike kept us apart, leaving no chance to kiss. I thought I must make a move next time somewhere no one could see—we couldn't just keep talking like this.\n[1981-06-20 19:30:00] outside Caesar's house / on the way home | I got on my bike and said goodbye to her, then rode away as fast as I could. I stood on the pedals and accelerated wildly. I said to her, 'Well, I'm off then, bye!' She said goodbye too. I felt an incredible happiness, repeating in my mind over and over, 'I was with Caesar.' But then I fell into anxious planning for our next date, grateful that her two-day trip gave me time to prepare.\n[1981-06-23 20:00:00] Fina gas station phone booth | I biked to the phone booth at the Fina gas station. I looked up the number in the phone book. I dialed slowly, pausing for a few seconds before the last digit, trying to steady my breathing. The phone booth was covered in dust. I saw that it was already dark outside. I knew the home phone wasn't convenient to use, and I had to be back before 8:30—it was an unbreakable rule. My heart kept pounding; I kept rehearsing in my mind how I should start speaking.\n[1981-06-23 20:05:00] phone booth | I pressed the receiver tightly against my ear and heard the call connect. After hanging up, I felt a wave of relief. I heard a woman's voice. When Caesar answered, I told her I had training tomorrow and couldn't go to her place. She suggested coming down instead. I asked if a boat trip would be good, and she said yes. In the end, we agreed to meet tomorrow. I heard the rumble of a bus slowly pulling into the station.\n[1981-06-23 20:15:00] Outside phone booth / on the way | I pushed open the door of the phone booth and stepped out. I saw an old teacher sitting on the bus staring at me. I cycled past the gas station and saw Helen Ster. I ran my hands through my hair, pushing it back, and realized it was all sweaty. I heard Helen Ster call my name. I shouted back. I heard the roar of a motorcycle engine starting. I felt the hot, thick air full of exhaust fumes. I saw Helen Ster wearing a black mask and bare-chested. I knew that the old teacher worked at Dad's school. I thought I must maintain a perfect appearance tomorrow—I was going to see Caesar again.\n[1981-06-23 20:30:00] Rockehaug Supermarket bus stop | I stopped outside the supermarket bus stop, propping my foot on the curb stone. I remembered the scene when Tor performed a kissing act. I recalled Tor saying at the time, 'Let’s see how long we can kiss, shall we?' In the end, he announced ten minutes. I saw a thick glob of spit on the sidewalk. Melese was hugging Tor with her eyes closed. I remembered meeting Tor here with Marivik a few weeks ago. I knew Tor had a homemade bicycle with a motorcycle seat attached. I realized I could copy Tor’s method—use a watch to time how long I kiss Caesar, so I could naturally go ahead and kiss her.\n[1981-06-23 20:45:00] on the way home / woods | I got on my bike and rode toward Holt. I was looking for a suitable place, and finally decided on the wooded path just above the gas station. I saw the light filtering gently through the deciduous trees. The ground there felt soft. I felt terrified and thought I had to find a place where no one could see us.\n[1981-06-25 17:00:00] Sjøna field | I pushed my bicycle up the hill to Sjøna field. I saw two companions sitting on the fence, and I walked over and stood between them. I asked, 'Doesn't anyone have a ball?' Christian asked me, 'Is it true you're with Kaja?' I bit my lip to suppress a smile and answered, 'Yes.' He said, 'Nice, her.' I saw the sprinkler hissing out a curtain of water in all directions. The sunlight was blindingly bright. I knew Christian had never had a girlfriend before. I struggled not to laugh, but inside I was overjoyed.\n[1981-06-25 17:10:00] Sjøna field | I saw everyone watching him. I casually replied, 'Yeah.' I remembered how last year during the Leivik Cup, Christian had been scolded by his father for buying a porn magazine. I knew he'd had to apologize and throw the magazine away.\n[1981-06-25 19:00:00] Sjøna field | I saw Larssen come in with a ball. We ran through the sprinkler to take shots. Near the end of practice, I saw Kaja arrive with her friends, and I waved at her. I heard Larssen shout, 'Focus, Grete Lundnes! Training first, girls second!' I saw the sprinkler moving across the field.\n[1981-06-25 19:30:00] Sjøna field / outside the changing room | After training, I dipped my head into a bucket of water. I saw Kaja walk down from the stands; she reached out her hand, and I grabbed it. I heard her ask, 'Are you going to change? I'll come with you. I have something to tell you.' I told her, 'Okay.' I felt nervous, wondering if she was going to break up with me. When her hand touched mine, I hesitated—was it accidental, or could I hold it? Finally, I decided to take the initiative and grab it.\n[1981-06-25 19:40:00] path above the field / changing room | I held her hand tightly as we walked along the path above the field. We reached our destination, I went inside to the bench and leaned my head against the wall. After changing, I slung my bag over my shoulder and walked out. She said to me, 'Well, hurry up.' I replied, 'Okay.' I saw Lars and Helle whistling. I knew they were waiting for me, leaning on their bikes. I noticed Kaja's fingernails were painted pink. I felt an unbearable happiness. I thought she looked especially appealing right then.\n[1981-06-25 19:45:00] outside the changing room | I heard her say, 'I’ll be home alone on Saturday. I told Mom that Suvi is coming. Do you want to come?'\n[1981-06-25 19:45:05] outside the changing room | I nervously swallowed saliva. I said, 'Yes.'\n[1981-06-25 19:45:15] outside the changing room | I heard shouts from the players inside the changing room. I saw Kaja standing there, holding her bicycle.\n[1981-06-25 19:45:30] outside the changing room | I suggested, 'Shall we go? Downward?' She said yes.",

    "text": "[1981-06-25 19:50:00] gravel road | We got on our bikes and raced down the shaded gravel road, me in front, her behind. We flew side by side down the slope. I saw sunlight shining on distant mountains. A shimmering swarm of insects gathered in the air.\n[1981-06-25 19:55:00] forest path | As we rushed down the slope, I spotted a narrow forest path to the right. We turned and cycled up about ten meters before jumping off our bikes. I shouted to Kaisa over the wind, \"Let's ride over there!\" She nodded in agreement. I suddenly realized it might be a good spot for a rendezvous.\n[1981-06-25 20:00:00] top of the slope | Without a word, I walked with her along the grassy path. We reached the top of the slope and looked out toward the woods; I surveyed the surroundings. I saw many broken branches and fallen logs lying across the ground. Tree stumps were everywhere, and spruce trees grew so densely they resembled a wall. I concluded this wasn't a suitable place.\n[1981-06-25 20:01:00] top of the slope | I said to her, \"No, this won't work. Let's keep going.\"\n[1981-06-25 20:02:00] on the road | I saw her mount her bike and start pedaling hard—harder than I would have.\n[1981-06-25 20:03:00] on the road | I glanced at her from the corner of my eye. I felt terrified, as if standing atop a high mountain looking down at water. I hesitated, wondering whether I should back out. I wondered what her serious expression meant now.\n[1981-06-25 20:05:00] main road uphill | We got off our bikes and pushed them through the deep shade of deciduous trees. We hadn’t exchanged a single word since leaving the court. The treetops formed a high canopy above us. I thought that if I were to speak now, it would have to be something important.\n[1981-06-25 20:05:10] main road uphill\n[1981-06-25 20:10:00] main road | I followed her onto the main road. I imagined myself cycling around the world. Before us stretched a long downhill stretch. I felt an urge to escape, to leave everything behind. I fantasized about being known as \"the cyclist from Leivik,\" exploring the world beneath ghostly lights.\n[1981-06-25 20:15:00] downhill road | We swooshed swiftly down the hillside. I heard her ask, \"Where exactly are we going?\" I replied, \"I know a good spot—not far.\"\n[1981-06-25 20:20:00] Rocky path | I saw the car parked there. I locked up my bike, then started walking deeper into the woods, feeling her following behind me. I tried to find a suitable spot to lie down, whether on grass or moss. Deep in the woods, I heard our footsteps sounding unusually clear. I heard myself say to her: \"We can leave the car here.\" I saw light seeping through the treetops, refracting like underwater rays, and shafts of sunlight slanting across the ground. The air was filled with birdsong. I felt unable to look at her, fighting back the urge to vomit.\n[1981-06-25 20:25:00] deep in the woods | I sat down without looking at her. I noticed she hesitated before sitting beside me. I reached into my pocket, took out the watch, and held it in my open palm, offering it to her. I heard myself say: \"We can lie down here.\"\n[1981-06-25 20:27:00] deep in the woods | I placed the watch on the ground. I heard myself say to her: \"I've got the watch—Thor kissed for ten minutes. We'll beat them by going longer.\" I noticed it was now seven forty-two.\n[1981-06-25 20:27:30] deep in the woods | I heard her ask: \"What?\" I repeated what I'd said about Thor's kissing time.\n[1981-06-25 20:28:00] deep in the woods | I felt my hand rest on her shoulder as I leaned toward her and pressed my lips to hers. After we both lay down, I slipped my tongue into her mouth. I felt her tongue—pointed and soft. I began moving mine inside, but kept my hands against my own body, not touching any other part of her. I felt as though we were two small boats moored beneath the canopy of trees. I tried to focus all my attention on the movement of the tongue. I could feel her breasts and thighs so close to me, my body burning, but I didn't dare touch her.\n[1981-06-25 20:31:00] deep in the woods | I felt her lying there with her eyes closed. I opened my eyes searching for the watch and saw only three minutes had passed. I pressed my lower abdomen against the ground and continued moving my tongue. Nine minutes later, I saw her eyes open, but she stared straight up at the sky. I felt saliva running from the corner of her mouth, making me uncomfortable. I noticed she shifted slightly, as if something was wrong. I heard her make a sound—\"Mmm... huh...\"—but it didn't sound like pleasure. I saw a few dry leaves fall onto her head. I thought it wasn't as wonderful as I'd imagined—actually, it felt rather strenuous. I realized we'd already surpassed Thor's record, but I still wanted to last fifteen minutes. My tongue root began to ache, and the sensation of drool on my chin made me feel disgusted.\n[1981-06-25 20:43:00] deep in the woods | At three minutes to eight, I pulled my head back. I saw her stand up and wipe her mouth, not looking at me at all. I stood up too. I excitedly said to her: \"We did it—fifteen minutes! We beat them by five!\"\n[1981-06-25 20:45:00] end of the path | I saw the bicycle glinting at the end of the path. I walked toward it and saw her brushing leaves off her clothes. I stopped and reached out to remove a blade of grass stuck to her sweater. I heard myself say: \"Wait, there's one more on your back.\" After that, I said: \"Okay, done.\"\n[1981-06-25 20:47:00] end of the path | I saw her mount her bike and pedal away down the path. I gripped my handlebars and began riding upward. I heard her say: \"I should probably head home soon.\" I said: \"Me too.\" I pointed ahead and said: \"There's a shortcut through the woods.\" Then we said goodbye to each other.\n[1981-06-25 22:00:00] Bedroom / On the way | I lay in bed. On Saturday, I waited until the last possible moment before biking down to the phone booth. I thought about her white, full breasts, imagining what we could have done in the woods. I realized I needed to call and confirm the exact time we'd meet on Saturday.\n[1981-06-27 19:30:00] home | I heard my mom ask me what I was going to do. I told her I couldn't say. She said no then, I had to know where I was. In the end, I confessed to her about Kaja. As far as I knew, I had to be home by eight-thirty, and that conflicted a bit with going over to her place. I knew the house phone was in the hallway, where anyone could overhear. I thought I couldn't leave her place at eight—that's what she'd think of me? I realized I had to get in touch with Kaja first.\n[1981-06-27 19:45:00] on the road / bus station | I cycled downhill, fastening the buttons on my coat. I saw two minivans parked at the station, and noticed the drivers chatting through their windows. Then the vehicles drove off in opposite directions. I saw many dark clouds in the sky, draining color from the earth. I felt the air grow cooler. The roads, stones, and leaves all looked gray. I felt my clothes puff out in the wind, like a balloon.\n[1981-06-27 20:00:00] phone booth | I parked my bike behind the green shelter. I took coins from my pocket and inserted them into the slot. I flipped through the phone book searching for the number, my eyes glancing at the dusty window outside. Finally, I dialed. I saw a small stream flowing through the bushes. I saw trash everywhere—wrappers from Caramello and Hubba Bubba gum, some newspapers, and cardboard boxes. Some silly word games popped into my head. I felt myself gathering courage.\n[1981-06-27 20:05:00] phone booth | I heard her say, 'Hello?' I quickly said, 'Hi, this is Grete Lundnes. Is this Kaja?' She answered yes. I told her I needed to confirm a suitable time. But she told me the date was canceled. I asked if it was because her parents weren't going out, and she replied, 'It's not because of that... I can't be with you anymore.' I felt a shock, thinking she was breaking up with me—we'd only been together for five days.\n[1981-06-27 20:06:00] phone booth / bus station | I said nothing. I felt hot tears running down my cheeks. I hung up the receiver and walked over to the station. I asked her, 'Is it over?' She answered, 'Yes, it's over.' In the end, she said goodbye, and I said it back. I could hear her breathing on the other end of the line; I felt overwhelming pain inside.\n[1981-06-27 20:10:00] on the road | I wiped away tears with the back of my hand and sobbed as I cycled back. I felt my vision blurred by tears, barely able to see the road. I kept wondering why she would do this—everything had just begun. I couldn't help shouting inwardly, 'Damn it!'",

    "text": "[1981-06-27 20:20:00] Yenhaug Supermarket / on the road | When I reached the supermarket, I dried my tears with my coat sleeve. I pedaled up that little hill, unable to stop sobbing. I saw the parking lot packed with cars and people carrying shopping bags, along with groups of children. The store was about to close. I worried people would notice I'd been crying, even though I was cycling. I felt a white, empty void opening inside me, and then Kaja's face appeared again, making me even sadder.\n[1981-06-27 20:40:00] home / Henrik Inge's room | I locked my bike, slipped into the bathroom to wash my face thoroughly, then returned to my room and sat down. After a while, I went into my brother's room and saw him sitting on the bed playing guitar. He looked up at me. I heard Henrik Inge ask, 'What's wrong? Have you been crying? Is it Kaja? She's not with you anymore?' I paused inside the doorway when entering—I didn't want to run into any family members.\n[1981-06-27 20:45:00] Henrik Inge's room | I nodded, and started tearing up again. I heard Henrik Inge tell me, 'It'll pass soon. There are plenty of girls out there.' I replied, 'This is serious. She was so great—I only wanted to be with her.'\n[1981-06-27 20:50:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw him stand up and rummage through his records, holding up one titled 'No Turning Back' in front of me. He placed the mat on the turntable, lowered the needle. I saw the turntable begin to spin with a soft crackle. He told me he was going to play a song that might help. He told me to listen to the lyrics.\n[1981-06-27 21:00:00] Henrik Inge's room | I sat in the chair listening to music. I heard Henrik Inge shout, \"Listen to this!\" The lyrics from the speakers said: What I'm saying isn't exaggeration, our relationship isn't perfect, long-term plans wiped out in a minute, you can just put on your coat and walk away. I heard powerful drumming accompanied by bass, guitar, and electronic instruments. The singer sang with a Stavanger accent.\n[1981-06-27 21:05:00] Henrik Inge's room | I heard the song say: We're one centimeter from mediocrity, we drink until we're drunk and sentimental, you shattered my heart and gave me pain, it will all pass, waking up to something entirely new.\n[1981-06-27 21:10:00] Henrik Inge's room | I saw the needle lift automatically and return to its base. I heard him say, \"It will all pass.\" I replied, \"I know what you mean.\" He asked if it helped, and I said a little, and asked him to play it again.\n[1981-06-27 21:30:00] floating dock | I walked down toward the floating dock. I saw a large group of people gathered around Jørn's new boat. As far as I knew, many people had gotten new boats this spring—mostly 10-footers with 5-horsepower Yamaha engines. I felt restless inside.\n[1981-06-27 21:40:00] floating dock | I heard Jørn say, \"Our Fermi is here too.\" Everyone laughed. I said, \"Hi.\" Jørn called to me, \"Come over here, I want to show you something.\" I answered that I didn't want to come. I felt uncomfortable again as that word was brought up once more.\n[1981-06-27 21:45:00] floating dock | I hesitated and took a few steps forward. I felt him suddenly grab my legs. The boat began moving backward, forcing me to crouch and then fall to the ground, being dragged toward the edge of the dock. I clung tightly to the edge. I felt the motor speeding up, my body hanging over the water. I started crying. Finally, Jørn shouted, and he stopped. I heard him yell at his brother, \"Back up!\" I screamed for them to stop. Finally, Jørn shouted, \"Enough!\" I felt intense fear. I noticed the others standing there just laughing, watching it happen, not helping me at all.\n[1981-06-27 22:00:00] cliff / bedroom | I saw Jørn release my legs. I scrambled up onto the dock and got away, sobbing the whole way. I sat on a rock to rest for a while. Eventually, I stood up and went home. I felt the warm air filled with the scent of sun-heated rocks, dry grass, and wildflowers. Night was falling. I felt physically weak. I thought about calling Kjell to ask why, but realized it was over anyway—asking wouldn’t change anything.\n[1981-06-27 22:30:00] bathroom / bedroom | In the bathroom, I washed my face with cold water. I returned to my room, drew the curtains, and put on a McCartney single. I began reading Bagley's *The Golden Keel*. I knew the book was about South American pyramids and underground caves, a treasure-hunting story. I could still feel my body trembling. I wanted to hide in the world of the book so I wouldn’t have to face reality.\n[1981-06-28 18:00:00] dining room | I sat down to eat dinner. I saw Mom looking at me and smiling. I heard her say, \"Maybe it’s time you started using a male deodorant—you’re almost in junior high. I’ll buy you a tube tomorrow.\" I foolishly asked, \"Deodorant?\" She said, \"You’re nearly in junior high.\" Henrik Inge chimed in, \"Actually, you will start to smell, and no girl will like that.\"\n[1981-06-28 20:00:00] bedroom | I heard Henrik Inge laugh and say he didn’t think it was that simple. I wondered silently—did Kjell leave me because I smelled bad?\n[1981-06-29 09:00:00] Bedroom / on the way | I closed the book and walked out the door without looking at Dad. I sat by the roadside, throwing pebbles onto the path. Then I started walking toward the big cherry tree to see if the fruit had ripened yet. I heard Dad come in and say to me, 'You can't just lie around reading all summer. How about going swimming?' I said nothing. I didn't want to respond to him. I thought I couldn't just sit here like this—people might think I have no friends to play with.\n[1981-06-29 09:30:00] big cherry tree | I climbed up the big tree, all the way to the highest branches. I picked cherries, bit off the skin, and spat the pits far away. I saw that the cherries weren't fully ripe yet—some green, some turning red, and the skins still hard. As far as I knew, no one had ever claimed ownership of this tree. We came to pick every year, and no one complained. I knew every branch of this tree.\n[1981-06-29 10:00:00] big cherry tree | I saw Jøn arrive on his bike and stop beneath the tree. I quickly scrambled down, and the moment my feet touched the ground, he was standing right in front of me. I turned and ran toward the woods uphill. I heard him call my name. He said, 'I just wanted to say I'm sorry! Come here—I can shake your hand, show you my apology!' I saw he was holding a gasoline can in one hand and gripping the handlebars with the other. I sneered inwardly and had no interest in accepting his apology.\n[1981-06-29 10:30:00] On the way | I stood on the hilltop after pushing through the bushes, watching him ride away. Then I walked back down the slope, then slowly back up again, glancing at the gardens on both sides. I saw the road was completely empty, everything quiet. I figured most people were probably out at sea or at work. I felt the sour cherries weren't interesting anymore. I hoped I'd run into someone on the main road, so I wouldn't look idle.\n[1981-06-29 11:00:00] On the way | I saw Tove's husband lying on a lawn lounger. Through the fence, I saw Mrs. Jacobsen sitting under an umbrella on her balcony, smoking, with her little son beside her. Then I saw Karl running toward me. I heard someone calling my name. I asked Karl, 'Where's Vemd?' He said he was on vacation. He asked me, 'Want to go out rowing with me?' I said yes. He suggested we go to Ylsta Island, and I said OK. I saw the grass had turned yellowish. Mrs. Jacobsen was wearing a white fisherman's hat.\n[1981-06-29 13:00:00] at sea | We got into the rowboat. I pushed off from shore and saw Karl sitting there rowing hard. I dipped my hands into the cool water. I heard him grunt 'Oof' with each stroke. I saw the sea was light blue, ripples forming whenever the wind blew. In the distance, waves crested with white foam. I knew Karl’s boat was a rowboat, so our range was limited. I gazed at the clear, cold water and felt a sense of clarity.\n[1981-06-29 14:00:00] small island | We approached the island. I jumped ashore and pulled the boat into a small cove. I saw Karl tie the rope to an iron post. We climbed the cliff, dove into the water to swim, then lay on the rocks to dry off. I heard him ask, 'Shall we swim?' I said yes. I felt the wind in the air was cold, but the water was warm. I knew there were many iron posts along the rocky edges of this island.\n[1981-06-29 15:00:00] small island | After dressing, I saw Karl squatting in the middle of the grass, lighting a patch of dry grass. I walked over and took the lighter from him. I asked him, 'Where did you get this?' He said he'd taken it from a holiday cabin. I suggested, 'Let's burn something.' I saw grass growing thick in the cracks. The bright flames were almost transparent.\n[1981-06-29 15:10:00] small island | I lit the grass. I felt a strong gust of wind sweep past, and the flame shot upward rapidly. We jumped up immediately and stomped to put it out. I shouted, 'Hey! Watch out! The fire's spreading!' Karl laughed loudly. I said to him, 'Help me—this fire's getting too big.' I saw the flame rise like a small blanket.\n[1981-06-29 15:20:00] small island | I took the lighter again. We lit fires in different spots. Where I set fire, the flames snaked outward like a serpent. Another gust of wind came, and I saw the flames leap as high as our knees. I heard him shout excitedly, 'Hear that? It's crackling!' I also heard him cry, 'Ouch, ouch!' I felt the fire grow fierce, the crackling sound right beside my ears.\n[1981-06-29 15:30:00] the islet | I saw him stomping frantically. I sensed fear in his voice, and I started stomping too. We took off our sweaters and desperately beat at the fire on the ground. I shouted, \"No! The fire's spreading over there too!\" I suggested, \"Take off your sweaters—we can use them to put out the fire!\" I felt the wind constantly whipping the flames, and the fire was spreading outward. I felt that the situation had already spiraled out of control.\n[1981-06-29 15:40:00] the islet | We kept beating at the fire, but it was no use. I stood a few meters away, watching the blaze. I heard Karl shout, \"We can't put it out.\" I said it would only get worse. He asked what we should do; I suggested using a ladle, but he snapped back if I'd lost my mind. Finally he yelled, \"Let's get out of here—go!\" I felt intense heat hitting my face. I saw the flames roaring fiercely, making sharp, crackling sounds.\n[1981-06-29 16:00:00] at sea | We pushed the boat away from shore. I saw Karl sitting there rowing hard. I looked back toward the shore. I heard him muttering over and over, \"Damn it, look at that fire go!\" I said who could have known. He reassured me it would be fine as long as no one saw us. I saw flames dancing across the grass, making terrifying noises.",

    "text": "[1981-06-29 17:00:00] shore / woods / home | We reached land and dragged the boat into the woods. We stripped off our clothes and scrubbed them in the water. To get rid of the smell of smoke, we jumped into the river and washed again. I sneaked into the basement to hang up the clothes, then went upstairs bare-chested, changed into clean clothes in my room. I thought that if anyone asked, we’d say our clothes had fallen into the water while swimming. I still felt somewhat shaken.\n[1981-06-29 18:00:00] bedroom | I saw Dad lying on the sunbed. I heard the distant sound of a radio. The lawn had turned yellow under the sun. The sunlight remained strong. I was observing from the window of Henrik Inge's room. I remembered how Mom used to sit on the windowsill in the living room. I thought he could lie there motionless like a lizard, basking in the sun.\n[1981-06-29 19:00:00] bedroom | I saw Mom walk into the room and hand me a bottle of MUM for Men. I looked at the little blue bottle and smelled its sweet scent. She explained that I should dab a bit under my arms after showering, and emphasized I must wash thoroughly first, or the smell would get worse. I knew I was about to start middle school. I noticed it was labeled for men only. I felt like I was truly becoming a man or a young adult.\n[1981-06-29 19:30:00] bedroom | I followed her instructions and applied the deodorant, then sniffed the new scent on my body. I lay down and continued reading my book about vampires. I knew I had bought the book myself, that it was my favorite, and that this was already my second time reading it.\n[1981-06-29 20:00:00] kitchen | I walked into the kitchen and sat down. I saw Dad’s skin deeply tanned, his eyes dark and heavy. I saw Mom brewing tea. I heard Mom say, \"Marta invited us up to their summer cabin today.\" Dad coldly refused, \"Don’t even think about it. Did she say anything else?\" Mom replied nothing special. I ate as fast as I could without seeming eager to escape.\n[1981-06-29 20:10:00] kitchen | I heard an engine starting up, accompanied by several groans. I saw Dad staring out the window, shaking his head. Dad asked, \"Isn’t Oskar Magnus away on vacation?\" I told him, \"Yes, but Helen Sterli and Tova aren’t gone—they’re home alone.\"\n[1981-06-29 20:15:00] kitchen | I heard the engine start again—this time with a loud roar. I couldn’t help wanting to stand up and see what was happening. I heard Dad command, \"Sit down!\" Mom asked what was going on. Dad sneered, \"Some damn kids are sneaking around driving their parents’ car.\" He looked at Mom and said, \"Unbelievable. Tova and Grete are in the same class—how could he steal a car like that?\" After finishing my meal, I said thanks for the snack and got ready to go back to my room.\n[1981-06-29 20:20:00] kitchen | I saw him turn and look at Mom. I sat there swallowing the last small piece of bread, finished the milk in my glass, then stood up. I heard Dad say, “It’s really unbelievable. Don’t they control their children at all? Toya Moen is in the same class as Grete Lundnes. He just took his parents’ car without permission?” I said to them, “Thanks for the snack. I think I’ll go to bed now.” Mom said to me, “Good night.” I heard the sound of the car rattling as it climbed up the hill.\n[1981-06-29 21:00:00] bedroom | I saw him come in before I turned off the light. I sat up in bed. I quickly looked up and met his eyes. I heard Dad ask, “How many apples did you eat today?” I answered, “One.” He pressed on, “Are you sure? Grandmother said she gave you one apple.” I replied, “Really? Oh, my God! I completely forgot about it!”\n[1981-06-29 21:05:00] bedroom | I felt his hand grab my ear and twist it hard. Then I saw his hand let go. I heard him demand, “You didn’t smoke, did you?” I shouted, “No!” He went on, “Helen Ster says you did. Are you saying Helen Ster is lying to me?” I answered, “Yes, he must be lying, because I never smoked.”\n[1981-06-29 21:10:00] bedroom | I saw him turn and walk out of the room, his face still dark. I lay down and stared at the ceiling for a while. I heard him say finally, “Why are you crying? If you’ve done nothing wrong? I know you, Grete Lundnes. I know you smoked. But don’t do it again. This time, we’ll leave it at that.” I wiped my eyes with the bedsheet. I thought, although I absolutely hadn’t smoked, he must know what I’d done—but how could he possibly know?\n[1981-06-30 14:00:00] the island | I saw Karl Larsdal put down his oars. We laughed in the boat until we almost fell into the water. I heard Karl Larsdal point at the island and say, “It’s all black up there!” I saw the island completely charred. I thought we couldn’t let go of this.\n[1981-07-15 10:00:00] farm / Jestead Lake / tent hospital | I stood under the scorching sun picking strawberries, packing them, and tidying carrot vines. At noon, I sat beneath a cliff eating my lunch, then biked to Jestead Lake and jumped into the water to bathe. I saw myself taken to a tent hospital in the middle of a field, where I lay until evening. I felt the weather unbearably hot. I heard someone playing Roxy Music’s 'More Than This' from far away. I gazed at the top of the tent. I knew Mom and Dad had gone hiking in the mountains this week, while I was working on the farm to earn pocket money. During a football match, I collapsed from the heat. I felt an unprecedented happiness, though I didn’t understand why—the feeling was clear.\n[1981-07-25 10:00:00] Bjørlingen | I sang loudly on the subway and chatted up strange girls. I bought a bunch of badges from a street vendor and a pair of black sunglasses. As far as I knew, Sverre was one year older than me and the most popular boy at school. His mother was Brazilian; he was handsome and strong. I realized that the trip Lars took me on to Bjørlingen had been very rewarding. I thought Sverre didn’t mind being with me—it gave me real status, made me feel above the kids from Tibaken.\n[1981-07-25 22:00:00] Bjørlingen | I lay in the tent. I heard Bryan Ferry singing 'More Than This.' I felt around me a luminous, clear, pale blue summer night. I sensed the big city filled with strangers, laughter everywhere, cars rushing past. I knew there were many record shops and concert halls here. I felt the song 'More Than This' was incredibly beautiful, touching me deeply. I thought this must be the reason for my happiness.\n[1981-08-15 10:00:00] home / school | I sat in the classroom attending the end-of-year party. I heard the principal speak to us. I knew that after summer vacation, we would enter seventh grade at Roligheden Junior High. I knew we had gone to a holiday cabin in South Bøvåg, and otherwise I usually spent the days lying in bed reading. I realized we were no longer children, but teenagers. I felt this summer was completely different from before, because ahead of me was a whole new school life.\n[1981-08-15 22:00:00] Torungen | I saw Dad take a powerful underwater flashlight, a rake, diving mask, and flippers. As we walked ashore, I saw seagulls scream and fly over our heads, some even diving toward us. We reached the outer side of the island. I felt the night pitch-black, the ocean lying quietly before me. I heard the piercing cries of the seagulls. I felt terrified by the diving seagulls. I saw that as we moved farther away, they gradually grew quiet.\n[1981-08-15 22:30:00] Trolungen | I saw Mom light the campfire. I saw Dad take off his clothes, put on his diving gear, and slip into the water, disappearing beneath the surface. After a while, I saw him emerge, water spraying from the snorkel of his mask.\n[1981-08-15 22:40:00] Trolungen | I saw Henrik Inge and me slowly walking toward the cliff. I saw Mom preparing food. I heard Dad say, 'There's nothing here—we should try a bit farther out.' I heard seagulls still shrieking behind us.\n[1981-08-15 23:00:00] Trolungen | I saw Dad surface again, holding a large crab in his hand. I saw Henrik Inge walk down to the water’s edge. I heard Dad shout, 'Bring the bucket!'\n[1981-08-15 23:10:00] Trolungen | I knew that usually people caught crabs on land using rakes and flashlights. I felt slightly embarrassed, thinking this way of catching crabs was unusual, and I was glad there was no one else on the island.\n[1981-08-16 00:00:00] Trolungen | I saw Dad pour a bucket of seawater over the campfire to extinguish it. I walked toward the boat and found a dead seagull in a hollow on the hillside. I reached out and touched it, noticing its body was still warm. I saw its leg twitch suddenly, so I poked a finger against its chest. I heard the crackling sound as the fire sputtered out. I saw the moonlight casting sharp clarity over the rocks, the dead seagull lying there with vivid colors and contours. The seagull’s spasm startled me—I wondered if it wasn’t really dead. Its lifeless appearance even made me feel a sense of disgust.\n[1981-08-16 00:05:00] Trolungen | I saw Dad’s flashlight beam hit my face, and I raised my hand to shield myself. He lowered the light onto the seagull. I heard Dad ask, 'What did you find?' I answered, 'A dead seagull. Over there.' The flashlight beam stood out sharply in the darkness.\n[1981-08-16 00:10:00] Trolungen | I saw the dead seagull lying in the beam of light, its eyes reflecting the glow. I heard Dad say, 'Looks like some chicks are in trouble. Their nest must still have young ones. That’s why they acted so crazed when they saw us—so agitated. Now let’s go.' I asked, 'Is that what you think?'\n[1981-08-16 01:00:00] On the boat / At home | We headed toward the lights. I looked at the bucket full of crabs. When we got home, I saw Dad drop the live crabs into boiling water. I kept hearing the rustling sound of crabs moving inside the bucket. I saw the crabs’ shells turn from green to brownish-yellow in the boiling water. Witnessing this act of killing gave me a strange sense of relief.",

    "text": "[1981-08-18 10:00:00] At home / Vesfjord | I saw Dad drive the borrowed trailer back and forth three times to move everything. I knew Dad had secured a teaching position at a high school in Vennesla, and he had rented an apartment in Sletta. As far as I knew, he planned to move our entire family there next summer.\n[1981-08-20 10:00:00] At home / School | I knew Dad had worked at the junior high school I was about to attend for thirteen years. I knew my brother had always been under Dad’s watchful eye. Dad leaving home felt like a huge relief to me. I was glad he’d been transferred—otherwise, I would have felt his gaze everywhere at school. Now, finally, I could breathe a little freer.\n[1981-08-20 14:00:00] Tvetter Old House (memory) | I saw Dad planting a peach tree beneath the sunlit wall, and I saw it heavy with fruit. I saw the garden lush with thriving plants. I realized Dad truly had a talent for gardening, and I saw how proud he was of that peach tree.\n[1981-08-25 08:30:00] Rolighetsøya Junior High | I walked into Rolighetsøya Junior High. I saw that all the buildings and teachers were unfamiliar. I saw that nobody played the games from elementary school anymore, except for football. I knew it was the first day of junior high, and it felt similar to starting elementary school six years earlier. I understood that the rules and rumors here were entirely different from those in elementary school. I realized we were no longer children.\n[1981-09-01 10:00:00] Schoolyard | During break, I saw groups of students who smoked standing by the shelter, playing with lighters. I saw some wearing leather jackets, others riding motorcycles. Sometimes I saw two boys break into a fight, drawing crowds from across the yard. I heard the smoking students laughing and chatting. I heard someone shout 'ah-ho!' As far as I knew, this group was shrouded in a mysterious aura of crime and drugs, and they hated school. I also knew Helen Ster often hung out with them. I sensed an unpleasant quality about these people, yet at the same time, I found it thrilling.\n[1981-09-15 10:00:00] School | I tried to understand the various rules of the school. I knew it took us several weeks to adjust to the new school. I knew we needed to figure out each teacher's limits and expectations.\n[1981-09-15 11:00:00] Classroom | I sat in class during lessons. I saw science teacher Lars always seemed dazed and absent-minded. I also saw home economics teacher Hansen sternly teaching us how to boil potatoes. I heard the crackling sounds Lars made during experiments. I heard Kurt happily talking with us, and everyone called him by his first name. I heard homeroom teacher Koløn speaking from the front of the class. I felt the air in the lab filled with smoke. I knew Kurt was in charge of the after-school club. Math teacher Vestad had been my brother’s homeroom teacher. Our homeroom teacher Koløn was a tall, thin man nearing thirty. I sensed each teacher had their own quirks—Lars might seem half-asleep, but he loved doing experiments, which made his class one we really enjoyed.\n[1981-10-01 10:00:00] School | I looked at the grades on my assignment notebook. I knew that junior high teachers gave us formal grades, which created a tense atmosphere in class. I knew my average grade was usually 'Good' or 'Good+'. I realized high grades weren’t necessarily a good thing—being top-ranked could even be seen as a character flaw. I sensed that although I didn’t hide my grades, I rarely mentioned them, aware of the shifting social dynamics in the classroom.\n[1981-10-15 10:00:00] School | I stood in the schoolyard, watching the upperclassmen who were the big names. I saw Ruri, Frida, and Sver hanging together, and I knew I could join them. I knew football was my great advantage, helping me connect with many older students. I knew Karl Larsdal and Karlsen had become insignificant figures in junior high. I realized I was trying hard to rebuild my reputation. I thought that if I could just stand beside those influential people, others’ opinions of me would change. I felt I no longer wanted to spend time with my old elementary school friends.\n[1981-11-01 10:00:00] School / Bratteklev | I saw Lars always laughing loudly and confidently. I went down into his basement and saw the walls covered with medals and wreaths. I heard Lars cracking jokes. I knew Lars had become my best new friend, and he lived in Bratteklev. I also knew his father was a European skating champion, and his mother was an enthusiastic Baywick woman. I felt Lars was extremely friendly and decisive—I really enjoyed being around him.\n[1981-11-15 08:00:00] On the way | On my way to school in the morning, I jumped off the car, climbed over the fence, picked the small apple, and ate it. Then I got back on my bike and kept riding. I saw a single small apple tree standing in the middle of the yard, with only one apple hanging from it. I knew that apple tree had been planted by the father for his child. I felt a whole new world opening up before me. I began thinking about the possibility of shoplifting—and strangely, I felt a sense of excitement.\n[1981-11-15 10:00:00] Residential area / On the way | I threw stones at streetlights and windows. I answered questions in class in a provocative way. I rushed into other people's gardens in broad daylight to pick apples. I started shouting swear words and crude slang loudly. I felt an exhilarating freedom in this sudden change. I thought I no longer needed to do good deeds or pray to God. I felt a kind of joy from destruction that I had never experienced before.\n[1981-11-20 10:00:00] home | I sat at home chatting with my mother and brother. I talked endlessly about my thoughts and imagination. I heard my own voice becoming more relaxed and joyful. I knew my mother probably didn't notice my change, since my father was no longer at home. I realized I had to keep certain things hidden from my mother. I thought to myself that in order to preserve the brightness and purity of our home, I must never bring back the shadows of the outside world. I felt completely open with my mother, but only within certain boundaries.\n[1981-11-30 10:00:00] home / outdoors | I sensed the twilight blurring, and everything in the outside world undergoing a shift in nature. I realized that whenever my father returned home on Fridays, the world inside me would be forced to shut down. I felt the outside world was unpredictable yet full of allure, while the patterns at home always required me to control every move I made.\n[1981-12-04 19:00:00] school gymnasium | I saw Henrik Inge carefully dressing up before going to the club, even wearing a neckerchief. I learned there would be a dance, with cola and sausages. As far as I knew, the school gymnasium hosted club events every Friday. I knew this had long been a mythical topic we often talked about. I felt this place was as distant and unreachable for me as a kite in the sky. My heart was filled with longing for this new world.\n[1981-12-04 19:30:00] school gymnasium | I biked to school. I passed by girls who were smoking. I bought a ticket and entered the dark gymnasium. I saw the flashing disco ball and spotlights. I felt the air was refreshingly cool. I heard loud music blasting through the speakers. I felt as if I'd been invited to some kind of ritual—my heart both tense and expectant.\n[1981-12-04 20:00:00] school gymnasium | I looked around and saw the older girls. I bought a bottle of cola, watched a few girls start dancing, and then I stepped onto the dance floor myself. I saw colorful lights flickering. The dance floor was empty at first, then gradually filled up. I knew the group of motorcyclists always gathered near the exit outside. I felt the rhythm of the music tempting me. I thought to myself that I didn’t just enjoy the music—I loved watching girls and dancing in this setting.\n[1981-12-04 21:00:00] school gymnasium | I danced to the beat, then sat with Lars and Erik drinking cola. I paid attention to my clothes and eyelashes. I smelled alluring perfume and sweat. I felt the intense rhythm of 'Funk Town.' I saw girls swaying their bodies in the dark. I knew this sense of superiority and concealing my academic performance might seem like a disaster to others. I felt like the center of attention, deeply content. I realized what I was chasing was exactly this—the beautiful body under shifting lights and the pounding heartbeat it brought.\n[1981-12-04 22:30:00] on the way / home | I biked home. I saw the familiar houses along the road and thought of the girls I’d seen at the gymnasium. I saw the indoor gymnasium transformed in the darkness. I felt dizzy, my mind full of anticipation. I knew Solveig, Håg and Marianne were all there. I knew they sold tomato-sauce sausages there. I realized that under the flashing lights, the otherwise dull gymnasium became magical. I felt that heavenly anticipation for the future.",

    "text": "[1982-01-15 10:00:00] residential area | I saw Lars leave by boat with his parents. While he was busy, I stayed in my room listening to music, reading, or chatting with my brother and mother. I no longer went to the beach or the floating dock. I knew Lars was good at skiing and often went to Årnes or Hofdene.\n[1982-01-15 20:00:00] school gymnasium | I approached a girl at the club and asked if she wanted to dance. I held her close and danced until the song ended. I asked her: \"Would you like to dance?\" She replied: \"Yes.\" I felt her soft, warm body. Music echoed all around us. I realized girls were easier to approach at the club. I felt those moments of closeness to the opposite sex carried an expectation of paradise. I thought even without anything further, such contact was immensely valuable.\n[1982-01-20 10:00:00] school | I watched the girls I had once interacted with. I saw Kaisa nearby and paid attention to whether she was talking about me with others. I knew Ingeborg, Marianne, and Kaisa all attended the same school and went to the club. I knew what happened between me and Kaisa in the woods was ridiculous. I felt a pang of pain when looking at them, but I knew they belonged to the past. I was deeply ashamed and vowed never to tell anyone about that incident. I felt the pressure of not being accepted, afraid they might spread a bad reputation about me.\n[1982-02-01 10:00:00] school | I watched Ingeborg Lofnes from the parallel class. I noticed the change in her figure. I knew I had been noticing her since fourth grade. I felt an attraction arising from her changing, fuller figure. I liked watching her smile and the way she dressed, finding her both fearless and gentle.\n[1982-02-07 10:00:00] Lars's house | I biked to Lars's house. I saw that he was about to leave for skiing but hadn't taken me along. I turned my bike around and rode away. I knew Lars was going to the ski slope with Sveinung. I felt intense disappointment. I realized my eyes were actually filled with tears, which made me deeply disappointed in myself. I hated these uncontrollable emotions.\n[1982-02-07 11:00:00] home / car | I received a phone call from Lars. I got into their car and we set off. I told Lars about the grain of sand (the excuse). Lars said on the phone there was a spot for me too. I told him I didn’t care about it—just had some sand in my eye. I knew Åmli had a large alpine ski center. I realized I should have refused to preserve my dignity, but I wanted so badly to go to that ski slope that I swallowed my pride.\n[1982-02-07 13:00:00] Åmli | I looked at the old pair of skis belonging to Lars’s father. I felt ashamed. I thought to myself: I’m already thirteen—why can’t I control my tears? I realized I had no justification whatsoever for crying.\n[1982-02-10 20:00:00] Hastensund | I took the bus to Hastensund with my friends. We knocked on a girl’s door and sat in her room. I looked at that beautiful girl. We chatted timidly. The pitch-black winter night made the surroundings feel desolate. There was an awkward atmosphere in the girl’s room. I knew the girl sang in the Ten Star Choir. I felt desire for her burning like fire inside me. On the way back, I felt so emotionally overwhelmed that I couldn’t speak.\n[1982-02-15 12:00:00] school cafeteria | I walked into the old gymnasium, now used as the cafeteria, and saw Lisbeth sitting at a table. I saw her looking at me. I heard Lisbeth say with disgust: 'Oh no, he makes me sick! I get goosebumps whenever I see him!' The cafeteria was packed with students eating lunch. I learned that Marianne repeated those words to me.\n[1982-02-15 12:10:00] school | I heard Marianne say: 'I don’t think so—I don’t think you’re a fag.' I asked in surprise: 'A fag?' She replied: 'You don’t know about this?' I answered honestly: 'No.'\n[1982-03-01 10:00:00] school | I walked through the schoolyard, hearing shouts all around. I saw the fourth graders following behind me. I heard everyone shouting: 'Fag! Fag! Fag!' I heard Nilssen mocking me: 'You faggot, you queer!' I realized the nickname was spreading at lightning speed. I knew even members of the soccer team were calling me that. I felt the word strike me like a verdict, leaving me nowhere to run. I realized I had become the laughingstock of the entire school, feeling overwhelming helplessness and despair.\n[1982-03-10 14:00:00] woodworking classroom | I grabbed a wooden bowl and smashed it against Helen Ster’s head with all my strength. I felt tears burst out. Later, I was sent out into the hallway. I heard Helen Ster laugh and apologize: 'I didn’t know you’d start crying. I didn’t mean it.' I had heard Helen Ster often did outrageous things, like shaving off her eyebrows or flashing her butt at teachers. I felt extreme anger and injustice. I realized that crying in public made me appear terribly weak, undoing all my previous efforts. I thought I must save myself and escape this contemptible situation.\n[1982-03-15 10:00:00] school | Lars said to me: 'Don’t pay attention to them.' I heard names like Sissel, Marianne, but I ignored the rumors. I understood the label 'faggot' had taken deep root. I knew teachers and parents usually didn’t call me that. I felt all my qualities erased by that single nickname. I was deeply grateful that Lars hadn’t distanced himself from me—I had feared it might lower his status. I realized that nothing I did seemed able to change the situation.\n[1982-03-15 16:00:00] Lars's garage | I saw Lars had placed many weight plates in the garage. I walked over and stood there talking to him. I told him I also wanted to try weightlifting and asked, 'How much do you lift?' After he gave me a number, I continued, 'Can you help me load the plates?' He replied, 'Can't you do it yourself?' I realized that even though he said I could use it freely, I had no idea how to operate it, so I had no choice but to ask for his help.\n[1982-03-15 16:10:00] Lars's garage | I followed him into the garage. After he left, I lay down on the bench and tried to lift the barbell. I first removed half the weight plates, found I still couldn't lift it, and finally took off all the plates, lifting only the empty bar up and down. Seeing him watch me after setting the weights, I said to him, 'I need to do this alone.' He asked doubtfully, 'You're kidding, right?' I felt I couldn't even move the barbell one centimeter. I thought if I didn't remove all the plates, I wouldn't be able to start at all.\n[1982-03-15 16:30:00] Lars's house | I walked back from the garage to Lars. I heard Lars ask how my lifting went and how much I'd lifted. I answered, 'Not as much as you—I had to take off two plates.' He said to me, 'But that's pretty good, you know!' I told a small lie, not telling him I actually only lifted the empty bar. Hearing his praise, I casually mumbled an agreement.\n[1982-03-20 10:00:00] Classroom | I was sitting in class during biology when I saw Jostein from the parallel class suddenly burst in and sit down. Later, I saw him get kicked out of class for causing trouble. I heard Miss Søsdal talking about homosexuality when Jostein shouted, 'Grete Lundnes knows everything about this! He’s gay, you know! Let him tell you!' Then I heard scattered laughter. I felt a wave of humiliation and began wondering if something was truly wrong with me. In that moment, I felt unprecedented darkness, thinking if I really were gay, what would be the point of living?\n[1982-04-01 10:00:00] School | As far as I knew, I had thought that after my past experiences with those girls, I would become increasingly skilled in handling emotions. But I found myself falling in love with Linea from the parallel class. I marveled that Linea was the most perfect, most beautiful rose in school. Her delicate shyness completely captivated me, making me feel no one else could compare to her.\n[1982-04-01 10:10:00] School | I learned that Linea had an older sister named Tove, whose beauty was entirely different—lively and provocatively charming. As far as I knew, both sisters were extremely popular among boys.\n[1982-04-01 10:20:00] School | I often secretly watched Linea, observing how she crossed her fingers when walking. I even started imitating her, tilting my head slightly to one side. I discovered that just seeing her made me content. I placed Linea on such a high pedestal that I considered asking her to dance or even speaking to her utterly absurd.",

    "text": "[1982-04-05 16:00:00] On the road | I saw Henrik Inge walking up the hill toward the store, so I hurried to catch up with him. He stopped and looked at me. I said to him, 'I'm in trouble—someone's given me a nickname.' He pressed, 'What is it? Come on, tell me!' I realized it took tremendous courage to tell him that nickname.\n[1982-04-05 16:05:00] On the road | I heard myself struggle to say the name: 'It's... they call me Femi Queer, I'm a queer.' Henrik Inge laughed and said, 'It's not a big deal—think of David Bowie; he's a 'gender-bender' in the rock world.' I knew that this 'femi' kind of androgyny might represent a certain artistic style in Henrik Inge's eyes. Seeing him actually laugh, I felt deeply disappointed. I thought, this is a huge deal for me, and he doesn't understand the pain such a nickname brings at all.\n[1982-04-05 16:10:00] On the road | I turned and went home. I heard him call after me, 'It'll pass, Grete Lundnes.' I responded gloomily, 'It doesn't seem like it will pass at all.' I felt he couldn't truly understand my situation.\n[1982-04-10 10:00:00] school | I heard Hilde say to me, 'You don't love me at all—you only love Line.' I argued back, but deep down I knew she was right. I learned that Hilde and Line were in the same class. She was tall and strong, even half a head taller than me. Our relationship lasted only two days before she ended it. I realized my infatuation with Line had become obvious to everyone. I noticed that on the playground, I constantly found myself subconsciously searching for Line’s figure.\n[1982-04-15 10:00:00] residential area | I often went hitchhiking by the roadside with Lars, heading to Hvasser, Sjølis or just hanging around outside supermarkets. I felt the nickname 'sissy' still loomed over me like a shadow. I knew I was gradually getting used to this torment. I always held onto a faint hope inside, wishing something special might happen while wandering around.\n[1982-04-20 10:00:00] residential area / gymnasium | I rode my bike to the new gymnasium, or went to the parish hall to watch choir rehearsals. I sat with Lars, chatting nonstop. I found out the hall was full of girls. Our minds were completely filled with thoughts of girls—constantly debating whose breasts were bigger, whose eyes sparkled most. I mentally calculated which girls seemed unattainable, and which ones might actually be interested in me.\n[1982-04-20 10:00:00] school | I watched Line from the school playground, and saw her look back at me. I heard from Lars that Line didn’t seem to think too badly of me, despite all the labels people mocked me with. I saw her give me a slight smile, even blushing. I thought to myself that this was my chance—I had to seize it, after all, I had nothing left to lose.\n[1982-04-23 10:00:00] school playground | I watched as Lars went to ask Line my question. I saw him coming back with a grin on his lips. I heard Lars announce, 'She said yes. Now you're together with Line.' I asked in disbelief, 'Is that really true?'\n[1982-04-23 10:10:00] school playground | I took a deep breath and walked across the playground toward Line. I heard Lars urging me from behind, 'Then go now and kiss her for me.' When I reached Line, I said, 'Hi.' I also heard her reply, 'Hi.'\n[1982-04-23 10:15:00] school playground | I saw Line lower her eyes, one foot scraping the ground. The class bell rang. I awkwardly said, 'Thank you for saying yes.' When I heard her laugh and ask what the next class was, I paused briefly before asking if it was Leivik language. Before the bell finished ringing, I invited her to meet after school. She readily agreed, 'Sure, I have training at the sports field. We can meet up afterward.' I looked at Line and thought to myself how incredibly beautiful she was.\n[1982-04-25 10:00:00] residential area | I started taking Line to various places, like Sjøna or the ferry terminal, but I always made sure to bring others along with us. I was fully aware this relationship wouldn’t last long—she would eventually end it. Line occupied my mind every single minute. This intense emotion made me feel anxious. I deliberately brought other people along to ease the pressure of talking with her—I was afraid I’d ruin everything.\n[1982-04-30 20:00:00] home | Lars stayed over at my place. We ate snacks and watched TV. I opened Helen Sandnes’s *Insect Summer*, my eyes instinctively falling on the page I had read countless times. I knew Mom had gone to Vesfjord to see Dad. I learned the rock concert on TV was meant to keep young people at home on the eve of May Day, so they wouldn’t go out causing trouble.\n[1982-04-30 20:30:00] home | I heard Lars suggest inviting Bent who lived upstairs. I exclaimed in surprise, 'Bent? Which Bent? But she's younger than us!' Lars shot back that she had developed quite nicely now. I realized it was too boring for just the two of us boys to be alone—we needed to invite a few girls to liven things up.\n[1982-04-30 21:00:00] Bent's doorstep | We quickly got dressed and ran up the hill, ringing Bent's doorbell. I saw Bent coming down the stairs, her face filled with surprise. We invited her over, and she told us, 'Not tonight.' We could only reply, 'Alright then, maybe some other time!' I knew Bent lived up here. Although I'd always thought of her as a child, Lars said she had changed a lot lately.\n[1982-04-30 22:00:00] Home | We returned to the TV and talked about our favorite bands and girls. We even called Siv from our class. My mind was in turmoil, unsure of what else might happen tonight.\n[1982-05-01 10:00:00] Home | I stared at the photos in a porn magazine, my insides churning. I felt an uncontrollable desire raging inside me. I marveled at how close yet distant the women in the pictures were. I couldn't understand how others could look at these images without going mad—the urge to rip a girl’s clothes off made my heart pound wildly.\n[1982-05-01 10:00:00] On the road | I carried the Bible handed out by school, asking others how they dealt with theirs. Lene sat quietly beside me, listening. I told Lene, 'I threw mine away.' I knew we would have our confirmation ceremony next autumn. It suddenly struck me that 'throwing away the Bible' might be a cool topic, something that could catch Lene's interest. But I also noticed Lene starting to look bored.\n[1982-05-10 10:00:00] Home | We carried playing cards with us, passing time at the playground or at friends’ houses. I knew during that period we wandered around aimlessly, our heads filled with girls’ names. I kept track of every little detail about those girls. I was certain Lene was the finest girl—no one could ever take her place in my heart. I thought to myself, not even Siv from our class could compare to Lene.\n[1982-05-15 19:00:00] Football field | I held Lene’s hand as we strolled across the field. After one training session, I stopped in the changing room hallway. I saw Lene leaning against a motorcycle, laughing and chatting with Frederiksen, who had already dropped out of school. I remembered kissing Lene at that crossroads once. Seeing the way Lene laughed at him, I instantly realized it was all over. I sighed—despite having perfectly straight teeth, to her I was still just a boring little boy.\n[1982-05-15 19:30:00] Football field stands | I walked up to the stands and sat down. Half an hour later, I saw Hilde approach and sit beside me. I heard Hilde say to me, 'I’ve got bad news—Grete Lundnes, it’s over with Lene.'\n[1982-05-15 19:35:00] Football field stands | I quickly turned my head away. I didn’t answer her at all. I whispered, 'Okay.' Hilde asked if I was crying, then added in surprise, 'You loved her? You were really serious?' I felt tears welling up, desperately trying not to let her see.",

    "text": "[1982-05-15 19:45:00] Football field / On the road | I trembled, gasping for breath, wiping away my tears. After seeing Hilde leave, I grabbed my backpack and walked out. I kept my head down as I passed Lene and Frederiksen. I heard Hilde ask if she should walk with me, but I refused. I heard Lene call my name: 'Grete Lundnes!' I felt a crushing tightness in my chest. I ignored Lene’s call, and as soon as I was out of their sight, I started running frantically.\n[1982-05-20 10:00:00] School | I saw boys in packs teasing girls in the school hallways and on the playground—yanking their sweaters from behind or grabbing them from the front. I heard the girls shrieking loudly, though clearly not loud enough to summon any teachers. I knew that because the upper grades were away on a camping trip, only our seventh grade remained at school, and this wild mood had quickly spread. I realized that attacking girls had somehow become normal under the current atmosphere, and I too sought some kind of release in that madness.\n[1982-05-25 14:00:00] Bøkevika (Bøkeskevika) | I came to Bøkevika for swimming with my entire class. Before me was a white sandy beach and deep blue sea. I felt the sun above burning intensely on my head. I knew it was the last week of May, and the weather had suddenly turned very hot.\n[1982-05-25 14:10:00] Bøkevika | I saw Ingeborg Lofnes walking out of the sea. She smiled brightly at everyone. I watched her wet white T-shirt and pitch-black hair. I saw sunlight shimmering on her wet hair, and her white clothes clung tightly to her body after being soaked by seawater. I noticed how the wet clothes outlined her soft curves, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from her.\n[1982-05-25 14:15:00] Bøkevika | I kept staring at Ingeborg. Without meaning to, I turned my head and saw teacher Kolås also standing there, staring at her. I immediately realized that Kolås’s gaze was exactly the same as mine. Suddenly I understood that he, as an adult, was desiring a thirteen-year-old girl in the very same way.\n[1982-05-25 14:20:00] Bøkevika | I saw him quickly lower his eyes. Though the moment was brief, I had already glimpsed a hidden corner of the adult world I’d never known before.\n[1982-05-25 19:00:00] Outside Sissel's house | Lars and I walked up to Sissel’s front door and rang the bell. I saw her father come out, then Sissel came downstairs and silently mouthed a clear 'no' to me. I heard Sissel say no. Although we asked if we could come in, we were left standing outside. I had heard rumors about Sissel and some boys. As far as I knew, some had pinned her down and gone too far. I imagined we also wanted to try something with her, but seeing her reaction, I realized it was nothing more than our own fantasy.\n[1982-05-28 14:00:00] Outside Vesfjord | Dad took me to see the old house by the river. I listened to him describe his plans for the future, moving around the house, peering through one window after another. I heard Dad talk endlessly about barns, fruit trees, and vegetable gardens. I saw it was a 19th-century house built beside water and against a hill. I knew this place was twenty kilometers from Vesfjord. I had already decided that no matter whether I truly liked the house or not, I would pretend to be excited and tell him I loved it, just to make him happy.\n[1982-05-28 15:00:00] The new house | I ran from one window to another. I decided I would transfer to the new school here. I saw the bright blue sky and heard the sound of flowing water. I saw lush green grass. I knew that if we moved here, Mom would apply for a nursing school position. I hoped Dad would see how excited I was, even though I was exaggerating a bit.\n[1982-06-01 10:00:00] At home | I learned that Henrik Inge refused to move. As far as I knew, this was the first time he openly opposed Dad. I felt the house shadowed by arguments. I thought to myself, this was unprecedented—because we had never dared defy Dad’s will before.\n[1982-06-01 19:00:00] Living room | I saw Henrik Inge standing in the living room, firmly telling an angry Dad no. I heard my brother protest: “I don’t want to switch schools in my final year. All my friends are here. Starting over somewhere else is absurd.”\n[1982-06-01 19:05:00] Living room | I watched the two facing off. I heard Dad roar: “Maybe you think you’re an adult, but you’re not! You belong with your family.” My brother replied simply: “No, I won’t.” I stared at them, suddenly realizing that Henrik Inge was now as tall as Dad.\n[1982-06-01 19:10:00] living room | Dad sneered, \"Then how will you support yourself? You won't get a single øre from me.\" My brother calmly replied, \"I can apply for a student loan. I've already looked into it.\"\n[1982-06-01 19:15:00] living room | I heard Dad ask sarcastically, \"You're going to apply for a student loan before even starting school? Brilliant idea. Where will you live?\" My brother answered that if there was no other choice, he'd rent a student flat. I knew the house was going to be sold.\n[1982-06-01 19:20:00] living room | Dad issued an ultimatum: \"Fine then, go ahead—but don't expect any help from us. Understood?\" My brother said firmly, \"Okay, no problem.\" I realized it was settled—my brother would stay alone in Vesfjord.\n[1982-06-05 14:00:00] Hove Boat Show | Lars and I swapped a winning ticket at the booth. I grabbed the large box of chocolates and quickly walked away. I heard Lars and Kristian arguing whether the ticket had expired. In the end, we compromised and each took half the prize. I knew we had stolen the winning ticket at the boat show in Hove. I felt both excited and tense—a guilty thrill after doing something wrong made me want to laugh uncontrollably.\n[1982-06-05 15:00:00] Hove | We ran into Sissel and decided to go for a walk together. I heard Lars ask her, \"Wanna come for a stroll with us?\" She readily agreed, \"Of course.\" The moment she agreed, I felt a strange stirring inside my body.\n[1982-06-05 15:30:00] pebble beach | We came to the pebble beach and lay down. I began carefully stroking Sissel's thigh, noticing that Lars was doing the same on the other side. I saw she was wearing red pants and a blue down jacket. I saw round, smooth pebbles all around us. I noticed that even when I touched the inside of her thigh, she remained completely silent.\n[1982-06-05 15:40:00] pebble beach | I heard Sissel say calmly, \"I know what you want—but you won't get it.\" I swallowed hard and forced myself to sound calm: \"We don't want anything.\" Lars mumbled agreement beside me. I felt my throat tighten with intense desire.\n[1982-06-05 15:50:00] pebble beach | I moved my hand up to the top of her thigh, then slipped it under her sweater, feeling her warm, pale skin. Finally, I tried to unzip her pants. I heard Sissel snap, \"No—what do you think you're doing?\" Embarrassed, I muttered back, \"Nothing at all.\" I touched her firm breasts—the surge of pleasure in that instant almost made me cry out. But after being rejected, I felt a sharp wave of frustration.\n[1982-06-05 16:00:00] pebble beach | I saw Sissel stand up and straighten her clothes. We sat there sharing the chocolate. I gazed at the sea, watching seagulls glide across the water. I heard her ask, \"Is there any more chocolate?\" Lars answered, \"Yeah, there is.\" I saw waves crashing against low rocks, spraying up like snow-white foam. I noticed a few seagulls skimming the surface with wings outstretched.\n[1982-06-05 17:00:00] boat show / on the way home | After finishing the chocolate, we returned to the booth. Coach Larssen stood there watching us. Eventually, we rode our bikes home. Larssen said coldly, \"I have no proof, but I know what you did. Otherwise, why would you accept only half the prize?\" We insisted we hadn't done anything wrong. He finally let us go, clearly disappointed. I caught the anger in the coach's eyes and sensed he never wanted to see us again that day.",

    "text": "[1982-06-07 08:20:00] school | I saw Lars lift up Siv's sweater, and I noticed myself instinctively pressing my hands against her breasts. I watched her walk away calmly. I heard her shriek that we were too childish.\n[1982-06-07 08:30:00] classroom | I went to the library and picked a book, then sat down on the seat beneath the window and started flipping through it. I saw there were many photographs in the book. I felt the outside air was foggy and extremely hot. I saw the schoolyard completely empty. I knew this was Leivik language class, and we had to finish reading our chosen book and write an essay within a week. I thought to myself that I had already read every single book in the school library—though the teacher didn't believe me, it was true.\n[1982-06-07 08:45:00] classroom | Suddenly I saw a naked woman in the book. I stared at her emaciated body, seeing even her ribs clearly outlined. I noticed a small patch of dark hair at the top of her thighs. I felt a deep shudder inside me at the sight.\n[1982-06-07 09:00:00] schoolyard | I stood up and went back outside, leaning against the wall and sitting down. I looked down at the grass growing in the cracks at the center of the yard. I felt the sun burning intensely, with a layer of haze all around. I saw the bright green grass and yellow dandelions slowly swaying in the strong wind. I felt waves of nausea and confusion. I thought this discomfort seemed to link the photo of the corpse I'd just seen with Siv's breasts and Cecilie's thighs.\n[1982-06-07 09:15:00] classroom | I stood up and returned indoors, calling Karl Larsdal over. I opened the book and pointed to the woman's photograph for him to see. I said to Karl Larsdal, 'I found a picture of a naked woman—want to see it?' I heard him exclaim after looking: 'Ah damn, that's disgusting. She looks like a dead person.' I looked at the woman in the book and felt she truly resembled a living corpse or a walking dead.\n[1982-06-12 10:00:00] Vesfjord / home | I followed Mom to visit Dad. I saw that his place in Slåtta was very simply furnished. Then Dad drove us to Grandparents' house for a meal. I saw that all the rooms in the apartment were white, with sunlight pouring through the windows and filling the interior. I knew whether we would move depended on whether the house sold and whether Mom got a new job. As far as I knew, Dad had suggested I stay with the grandparents. I felt something strange about Dad living in such an empty, spacious room. I thought it wouldn’t be bad to leave this neighborhood and go to a new school, since I’d already used up all the good transport here.\n[1982-06-15 11:00:00] school corridor | I stood in the hallway outside the classroom, staring at Cecilie. I heard Cecilie approaching me and saying, 'Did you know, Grete Lundnes? We were just talking about you in the locker room—I realized none of the girls in class like you.' I replied, 'Don't know.' From the expression on her face, I detected undisguised mockery.\n[1982-06-15 11:05:00] school corridor | I slapped her hard across the face. I saw her cheek instantly turn red, and people around us turned in surprise to look. I heard her shout defiantly, 'Did you hear? Not a single girl in class likes you!' I stared at her, feeling a sudden surge of rage welling up inside me.\n[1982-06-15 11:10:00] school corridor | I felt her fist hit my mouth. I grabbed her hair, and we took turns kicking each other. I couldn't stop crying. I felt a large hand grab the back of my collar. I saw Teacher Kulun holding onto both of us. I heard someone shouting, 'He's crying!' I heard Kulun loudly demanding why we were fighting. I said it was nothing. I felt utterly frustrated and pitiful. I thought to myself that I was truly worthless. I realized I had become a laughingstock—because I broke the no-crying rule and actually hit a girl.\n[1982-06-15 11:20:00] classroom | I did as the teacher said, reaching out to shake her hand. I saw Cecilie smiling at me. I heard Kulun insist that we must shake hands. I heard Cecilie say sorry to me. I sensed no mockery in that smile—only sincerity. I wondered if it meant we had shared something special between us.\n[1982-06-15 14:00:00] Tveita | As far as I know, when I first moved there two years ago, I was just a thirteen-year-old kid. I remember on my first day at school everyone wanted to talk to me. I recall that no one gave me a hard time back then—I preferred swimming and playing football. I remember how girls would often come riding from far away in the afternoons just to meet me.\n[1982-06-15 16:00:00] Tveita Beach | I am playing football. I see two girls stop their bikes behind the woods, looking over at us, then getting back on and riding further down, stopping again to look. I hear Trond ask, 'What do they want?' I hear Ciliavik reply, 'They came here to see Grete Lundnes.' I am at Tveita Beach, surrounded by woodland.\n[1982-06-15 16:05:00] Tveita Beach | I hear Trond say skeptically, 'Nonsense—they wouldn’t ride all the way from Hamresanden just for that; it’s ten kilometers!'\n[1982-06-15 16:05:05] Tveita Beach | I hear Ciliavik say, 'Well, what else would they come here for? At least not to see you—you’re always here anyway.'\n[1982-06-15 16:05:10] Tveita Beach | I see the two girls moving through the bushes. I notice one is wearing a pink jacket and the other a light blue one. I also see they both have thick hair.\n[1982-06-15 16:05:15] Tveita Beach | I hear Trond say, 'Alright then, come on, let’s play football.'\n[1982-06-15 16:05:25] Tveita Beach | We continue playing football on the beach. I see the girls standing in the reeds about a hundred meters away for a while, then they ride off like a flock of strange birds. I think I know who they are, but I don’t find them particularly pretty, so I ignore them.\n[1982-06-15 16:05:30] Tveita Beach | I hear Trond say, 'Alright then, come on, let’s play football.'\n[1982-06-15 16:10:00] Tveita Beach | We keep playing together on the narrow stretch of beach where Ciliavik and Tom’s father had earlier marked out the goalposts. When the girls arrive at a patch of reeds, I see them stop, over a hundred meters from us. I ignore them, watching as they stand there among the reeds for about ten minutes, like a flock of strange birds, before finally pedaling off toward home. I know who they are, and since I don’t think they’re especially pretty, I don’t pay them any attention.\n[1982-06-18 14:00:00] School | I receive farewell gifts from my classmates: a cabbage and a stuffed monkey toy. I knew I had to tell everyone about the move beforehand. I know my nickname, Kål, means 'cabbage' in the local dialect. I realize they gave me the monkey because they think I look a bit like one. I think to myself that this is all the gift I’m getting.\n[1982-06-18 18:00:00] Winnie's house | I walked out of the school gate. I saw the others set off on their bikes at six o'clock. I knew it was the last day of seventh grade, and there would be a class party in the evening. As far as I knew, several girls had started preparing in the afternoon. I thought this might be the last time I'd see these classmates.\n[1982-06-18 21:00:00] Winnie's garden | I felt the dark veil of summer night descending. I saw the red roofs of the residential area shimmering in the afterglow of sunset. I sensed something secretive, like hidden desire, brewing in the air. I noticed the party was gradually taking a different turn—though no one was drinking, I could feel an uneasy restlessness spreading.\n[1982-06-18 22:00:00] Winnie's garden | I felt my hand slip beneath a girl’s sweater. I saw several girls walking around topless. I watched their bare breasts quiver slightly as they moved. I stood among the lilac bushes in the garden, feeling a close, warm breath in the air. I felt lips meeting lips in kisses. I thought to myself that this was a long-building, preadolescent revelry—wild and unrestrained.",

    "text": "[1982-10-15 17:00:00] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I was moving small wooden planks in the warehouse of the solid composite flooring factory. I saw three girls from Hamresanden walk into the large storage hall. I saw Line come straight toward me and lean her arms on the wooden rack. I learned that Ciliavik’s father worked in the factory’s management department, and if there was work available, he would pass word to us through William’s father. I knew this job paid by the piece. I thought I had already learned how to move the planks quickly and neatly. I noticed Line seemed very confident, chewing gum while watching me work.\n[1982-10-15 17:10:00] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I knew Line was only in seventh grade, but I’d heard she was very interested in me. I observed that Line was much bolder than the girls I’d seen earlier in the reed fields. I saw her two companions timidly hanging back behind her.\n[1982-10-15 17:10:10] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I knew Line’s older sister was a photography model. I knew she was popular in class. I had heard the rumor that she liked me, and I thought perhaps I could go along with it. I looked at her long legs and full hips, though I thought she looked gangly, like a young calf. I noticed she couldn’t pronounce the 'r' sound, which made her seem a bit dazed, even a little foolish.\n[1982-10-15 17:10:20] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I heard Line say to me: “Hi, I came here to see you. Are you happy about that?”\n[1982-10-15 17:10:30] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I turned around, picked up a stack of planks, threw them onto the rack, and pushed the protruding ends flat. Then I went to pick up another pile. I replied to her: “Is that so?”\n[1982-10-15 17:10:40] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I heard her ask me: “How much do you earn per hour?”\n[1982-10-15 17:10:45] Hardwood Flooring Factory Warehouse | I explained to her: “It’s piecework—we get twenty kroner for two stacks, forty kroner for four.”\n[1982-10-15 17:10:50] wood flooring factory warehouse | I heard her reply, \"Oh.\"\n[1982-10-15 17:11:00] wood flooring factory warehouse | I stood in the center of the vast warehouse floor, seeing towering wooden racks piled high to the ceiling all around me. I saw Ciliavik and Trygve bent over, working a few meters away. I watched my companions at work, and for a moment they looked to me like two little dwarves.\n[1982-10-15 17:11:10] wood flooring factory warehouse | I heard her ask me, \"Do you like me?\"\n[1982-10-15 17:11:15] wood flooring factory warehouse | I responded to her, \"Well, you know, this liking business, Miss Blom.\" I had decided this time to take a step forward, but when she actually stood before me, I felt unable to move. I realized her mature, confident manner was something I couldn't handle.\n[1982-10-15 17:11:25] wood flooring factory warehouse | I heard her say, \"I like you—you must have heard that by now?\"\n[1982-10-15 17:11:30] wood flooring factory warehouse | I bent down to straighten the planks, feeling my face suddenly flush. I didn't dare look into her eyes. I told her, \"No.\"\n[1982-10-15 17:11:40] wood flooring factory warehouse | I saw her lean against the wooden rack, chewing gum for a while, then straighten up and walk away. I noticed our companions over there watching us impatiently. I heard her say finally, \"Alright then.\"\n[1983-09-01 10:00:00] school (memory) | I knew I had missed the chance, but I cared more about how things had unfolded. I learned that old prejudices had followed me to my new place. I felt I lacked the courage to cross that final bridge. I thought I might never meet another girl who would come right up to me like that again.\n[1983-09-01 10:05:00] school (memory) | I knew Inge was one grade below me. As far as I knew, I had never spoken to her during my two years at that school. From the first day of school, I had fixed my attention on Inge. I found her extremely attractive. I stared at her long, narrow eyes and slightly turned-out upper lip. I imagined her private world, one that didn't include me. I felt her smile was deeply captivating.\n[1983-09-01 10:10:00] school (memory) | I knew Susanna was Inge's cousin and was in a parallel class with me. I learned she lived across the river. I looked at Susanna's prominent front teeth, saw her full breasts that seemed ready to burst, and her hips just the right width. I noticed her eyes, which always seemed prepared for action.\n[1983-09-01 10:15:00] School (memory) | I knew I was with Susanna, and that Vallund had also gotten together with Karin. I realized Inge radiated an unattainable mystery, while Susanna seemed plain and ordinary. I thought to myself that with Susanna, my feelings of failure and fear would be less. I remember that year I was fourteen.\n[1983-10-01 15:00:00] Tvet Area | I knew my relationship with Susanna existed somewhere between the world of children and that of teenagers. I noticed she didn't display any special affection in public, but instead preferred to spend time with Karin.\n[1983-10-01 20:00:00] Tvet Area | I knew that on weekends we could go watch movies together or hide in the basement living room eating pizza. As far as I knew, kissing had become a routine, mechanical act. I felt how close we had become, and I had discussed future plans in detail with Vallund.\n[1983-11-18 19:00:00] Susanna's house | I ate a slice of pizza. I felt Susanna sit down on my lap. I began exploring her body, and saw Vallund entwined with Karin. I heard Dire Straits' 'Telegraph Road' playing from the stereo. I knew Susanna was home alone that day, and after Vallund came by my place on his bike, we went over to her house together. I sensed a kind of timelessness in the living room, as if time had stopped.\n[1983-11-18 19:30:00] Living room at Susanna's house | I nodded, then we stood up, holding hands as we walked toward her bedroom. I heard Susanna whisper in my ear, 'I love you, Grete Lundnes. Come into my room?'\n[1983-11-18 19:30:10] Living room at Susanna's house | I heard Susanna say to Vallund and Karin, 'We're going to my room now, so you can have your privacy.'\n[1983-11-18 19:30:20] Living room at Susanna's house | I saw Vallund and Karin look up and nod at us, then resume kissing. I saw Vallund's hand move gently across Karin's back. I noticed Karin's long hair falling over Vallund's face. I watched their entangled lips and tongues, feeling the air thick with intimacy.\n[1983-11-18 19:30:30] Susanna's bedroom | I saw Susanna smile at me. She tightened her grip on my hand and led me down the hallway into her room. I saw the room dimly lit, and felt it was much colder here than outside.\n[1983-11-18 19:30:40] Susanna's bedroom | I saw a white floral tapestry hanging on the wall, and clothes neatly folded inside the white wardrobe. I saw a makeup case placed on a shelf. I knew this was Susanna’s bright, perfume-scented room. Unlike Vallund’s room, which I knew was always dark and smelled faintly of sweat. I thought to myself that I enjoyed being here with her, even if we were just talking or watching TV together.\n[1983-11-18 19:30:50] Susanna's bedroom | I stared at her blue jeans hanging over the chair back, and swallowed hard. I thought about how those pants would cling to her thighs and hips—this image stirred a powerful emotional storm within me.\n[1983-11-18 19:31:00] Suzanna's room | As far as I know, Suzanna's parents have always been very kind to me. I could sense an atmosphere in this house that made it clear they regarded me as one of their own. I thought to myself that I was part of Suzanna’s world—a person she would talk about with her parents and little sister—and that feeling made me really enjoy being here.\n[1983-11-18 19:31:10] Suzanna's room | I saw her walk over and close the window. Then everything fell silent. I saw that fog had risen outside; the neighbor’s lights were almost lost in the gray. I heard a few cars pass by down the road, their stereos booming.\n[1983-11-18 19:31:20] Suzanna's room | I saw her give me a small smile and sit down on the edge of the bed. I whispered 'Hi' to her. I also heard her laugh softly and reply, 'Hi.'\n[1983-11-18 19:31:30] Suzanna's room | I remembered once when I reached inside her ski suit, she said 'No.' As far as I knew, that refusal wasn’t accusatory at all—it felt more like checking how things were progressing, as if setting up a boundary between us, a kind of law. I thought to myself that I didn’t expect anything else—only that we weren’t sitting, but could lie down together here.\n[1983-11-18 19:32:00] Suzanna's room | We pressed close together, fumbling against each other, my face constantly buried in her hair. I felt that after continuing for a while, this fumbling began to make me feel almost nauseous, as if the motions had become purposeless. I realized I was searching for a breakthrough, yet remained stuck in place.\n[1983-11-18 19:35:00] Suzanna's room | I sat down beside her and kissed her. I climbed on top of her, then shifted to her side, pressing my legs over hers. I stroked her shoulders and arms with my hands, and when I touched her hand, I felt her grip mine tightly. I lifted my head and opened my eyes to look at her. In the dimly lit room, I saw her face appeared unusually pale, her expression deeply serious. I felt the softness of her body beneath me, heard her let out a faint moan, and wondered if I was pressing too heavily on her.\n[1983-11-18 19:36:00] Suzanna's room | I leaned down to kiss her neck, then rested my head on her chest. I began stroking her hips, then lifted her sweater to kiss her lower abdomen. I saw her grab the hem of her sweater and slowly pull it upward. I heard the beating of her heart. I thought I had never kissed her neck before. I felt her fingers threading through my hair, gently caressing me.\n[1983-11-18 19:36:30] Suzanna's room | I saw her bare breasts revealed before me. I heard the song 'Telegraph Road' start playing again in the living room outside. I could hardly believe my eyes.\n[1983-11-18 19:37:00] Suzanna's room | I pressed my mouth tightly against her, licking with my tongue, sucking with my lips, rubbing my cheeks back and forth across her breasts. Finally, I kissed her by pressing down onto them. Then I clumsily began trying to unbutton her pants. I felt this progression went beyond anything I'd ever dreamed of. For those few seconds, I completely forgot about her. I felt a craving for more, a desire to break through the present moment and move forward.\n[1983-11-18 19:47:00] Suzanna's room | I saw the button come undone. I pulled down the zipper of her pants and tugged them down to her knees. I placed my hand on her underwear. I saw the white underwear appear. I swallowed hard, feeling the soft hair beneath my hand on her underwear.\n[1983-11-18 19:48:00] Suzanna's room | I pressed myself on top of her again and kissed her, pulling down her underwear. My fingers slid downward through her long hair. I heard her softly call my name: \"Grete Lundnes.\" When I felt the wet, slick warmth under my fingertips, a sudden tearing sensation surged inside me, a sharp pain flashed across my abdomen, and then a spasm-like writhing spread through my lower belly. I realized everything had changed, become utterly unfamiliar.\n[1983-11-18 19:48:30] Suzanna's room | I looked at Suzanna, seeing her still lying there with her eyes closed, mouth half-open. I heard her heavy breathing. It seemed to me she didn't feel what I had felt. I thought those naked breasts and thighs suddenly meant nothing to me anymore—I was no longer the person I had been just moments ago.\n[1983-11-18 19:48:40] Suzanna's room | I heard her ask me: \"What's wrong?\"\n[1983-11-18 19:48:45] Suzanna's room | I said to her: \"Nothing. Maybe we should go stay with them.\"\n[1983-11-18 19:48:50] Suzanna's room | I heard her refuse: \"No, wait a little longer.\"\n[1983-11-18 19:48:55] Suzanna's room | I replied: \"Okay.\"\n[1983-11-18 20:00:00] Suzanna's room | We continued exploring each other’s bodies. I kissed her breasts. Then we embraced again and kissed. I felt this touching could not stir any response in me—everything felt strange. I sensed I had completely lost my desire, even feeling like slicing bread instead. But after a while, pleasure returned, and I began only wanting to hold her and kiss her.\n[1983-11-18 22:30:00] Suzanna's room | I heard someone knock on the door. We panicked and sat up on the bed. I saw her hastily put on her pants and pull down her sweater. I saw Vallund walk in.\n[1983-11-18 22:30:10] Suzanna's room | I heard Vallund ask: \"Are you leaving?\"\n[1983-11-18 22:30:15] Suzanna's room | I heard Suzanna reply: \"Yes, just a moment—we'll be right there.\"\n[1983-11-18 22:30:20] Suzanna's room | I heard Vallund urge, \"It's half past ten. I'd better leave before your parents get home.\"",

    "text": "[1984-07-15 18:59:00] Tvet old house garden | I recalled summer evenings when Mom, Dad, and I sat around the garden table barbecuing. As far as I knew, we had been full of hope for the future when we first moved to the countryside. I realized later that this hope gradually became mixed with a kind of self-mockery. I remembered one thing my father said—it was one of the few specific things I could still recall.\n[1984-07-15 19:00:00] Tvet old house garden | I heard Dad say, \"Our little family is absolutely flawless!\"\n[1984-07-15 19:00:10] Tvet old house garden | We swam in the river in the mornings, played football in the shade, rode bikes to Hamresanden campsite to sunbathe and look at girls. In July, I went to the football cup and got drunk for the first time. Although I didn't understand the irony behind Dad's words, those evenings felt truly joyful to me. I felt that sarcastic undercurrent running through that entire summer.\n[1984-07-20 16:00:00] Stranger's living room | I sat drinking in a stranger's living room. I felt myself laughing heartily. Around me were unfamiliar furniture, girls, and a garden. I learned someone knew the homeowner and could get beer. I felt an explosive joy. I thought this must be what I wanted—every worry had vanished.\n[1984-07-20 16:30:00] Stranger's living room | I looked at photos of myself: in the first, I was lying among a crowd holding a skull, my face twisted in laughter; in the second, I was lying on a bed wearing sunglasses, laughing wildly, one hand gripping a beer bottle, the other holding a skull over my crotch. I knew it was the summer of 1984, when I was fifteen. Recalling that experience, I thought drinking felt absolutely amazing.\n[1984-08-20 10:00:00] Around Tvet | We napped on rocks beneath the waterfall or jumped into the water. On Saturday afternoons, we took the bus into town to buy treats and browse record stores. I felt childhood was still continuing, yet deep down I couldn't stop longing for high school life.\n[1984-09-01 09:00:00] Vesfjord | I knew Mom had taken leave to study in Baysang, and I had moved into my grandparents' house on Elve Street. I learned that my grandfather had run his accounting office there for many years. I thought maybe Dad felt I was in the way, so he suggested I move out.\n[1984-09-01 10:00:00] Vesfjord (memory) | I realized I was sixteen then, in my first year at church school. As far as I knew, my parents hadn't divorced yet. I thought I couldn't have guessed at all how their relationship would turn out.\n[1984-09-01 10:00:10] Tvet old house (memory) | I saw a river in front of the house. The old house stood high up, with woods behind it. I knew we lived in Tvet back then. As far as I knew, the entire property also included a large grain barn and a storage shed.\n[1984-09-15 10:00:00] Jimler Hall auditorium (memory) | I saw a teacher with wild white hair and a loose robe walking down the steps, reading poetry to us. I heard the teacher suddenly insert a line praising an erect private part in that poem. In the auditorium of Jimler Hall, surrounded by freshmen. I knew that teacher was a notorious nudist. I saw everyone in the room burst into laughter.\n[1984-09-15 10:05:00] Jimler Hall auditorium (memory) | I sat there with my mouth open and eyes fixed blankly ahead. I didn't laugh. I thought to myself, are all erect things really bent? I was slowly beginning to grasp the meaning of that line of poetry.\n[1984-11-15 18:00:00] Tvetold old house | I felt the chill in the house. I saw clumps of dried cat droppings curled up on the sofa upstairs, and an old dishwasher standing on the kitchen counter. All the heating was turned off. I knew my father mostly ate out, and the house was almost devoid of life. I sensed a deep silence enveloping the house. I realized my father was suffering inside.\n[1984-12-02 19:38:00] Tvetold old house | I set down my handbag in the cold bedroom. I bumped into my dad just as he returned, in the hallway. I saw his hair was disheveled and his eyes dark and sunken.\n[1984-12-02 19:38:10] Tvetold old house | I asked my dad, \"Can't we light a fire? It's too cold here.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:38:15] Tvetold old house | I heard my dad mockingly imitate my pronunciation: \"Light a fire? We don't fucking light fires here.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:38:25] Tvetold old house | I knew I couldn't pronounce the 'r' sound—it was my greatest childhood insecurity. As far as I knew, my father always mimicked me either to correct me, or simply because he disliked me and wanted to oppose me.\n[1984-12-02 19:38:35] Tvetold old house | I turned and walked up the stairs. Back in my room, I grabbed a few new records and took out several sweaters from the closet. I dressed quickly, slung my travel bag over my shoulder, and walked out of the yard. I knew I was nearly sixteen years old. I was glad he didn’t see the tears in my eyes—I felt ashamed of them. I felt my father had placed an inescapable lid over my head, and I decided to defy him.\n[1984-12-02 19:39:00] Tvetold old house | After going upstairs to my room, I grabbed a few new records and stuffed them into my handbag, then went downstairs to the room beside the front door where my wardrobe was. I took out several sweaters from the cabinet, put on clothes in the hallway, slung my travel bag over my shoulder, and walked out of the yard.\n[1984-12-02 19:39:20] Outside Tvetold old house | I started walking downhill. I saw a sky full of stars and a high-hanging moon, with the hills bathed in moonlight. I heard my footsteps crackling on the icy ruts. I saw the thin-iced snow glittering under the lights, and the grass was brightly lit.\n[1984-12-02 19:39:40] beside the roadside mailbox | I stopped beside the mailbox. I hesitated for a moment about whether to turn back and say goodbye. I thought it would mean more to leave without saying anything—it would make him reflect on what he'd done.\n[1984-12-02 19:40:00] beside the roadside mailbox | I pulled off my glove and pushed up my sleeve to check my watch. As far as I knew, there would be a bus in half an hour. I thought it was 7:40 now—how great it would be if I could catch that bus home.\n[1984-12-02 19:40:10] beside the roadside mailbox | I cursed inwardly—damn it, don’t let me miss the bus.\n[1984-12-02 19:40:20] by the roadside | I slung my travel bag over my shoulder and kept walking, casting one last glance back at the house. I saw a thin wisp of white smoke curling up from the chimney on the roof. I figured he must have regretted it already, brought in firewood and lit the stove—he probably still thinks I’m lying upstairs in my room.\n[1984-12-02 19:40:30] by the roadside | I heard the ice cracking on the river. The sound rushed up the valley with a loud boom.\n[1984-12-02 19:40:40] by the roadside | I looked up at the starry sky and the moon. I saw headlights from cars on the opposite bank cutting through the darkness like cracks. I saw the water gauge on the ice glowing faintly with damp light. The air carried a chill. I felt a shiver run down my spine. That sound of ice breaking always fills me with immense joy.\n[1984-12-02 19:41:00] by the roadside | I turned around and started walking back up again. I thought that since he had already lit the fire out of regret, leaving without a word had lost its meaning.\n[1984-12-02 19:45:00] entrance of the old Tveted house | I came in and began untying the laces of my boots. I saw him open the door, standing there holding the doorknob, watching me. I heard his footsteps above me in the living room.\n[1984-12-02 19:45:10] entrance of the old Tveted house | I heard Dad ask, \"Are you going out?\"\n[1984-12-02 19:45:15] entrance of the old Tveted house | I nodded at him. I thought I’d already gone out and was now coming back—but there was no way I could explain all that.\n[1984-12-02 19:45:20] Tvetold House foyer | I said to Dad, \"That's right, we're starting early tomorrow.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:45:25] Tvetold House foyer | I heard Dad say, \"Alright, alright, I think I'll go out for a bit tomorrow afternoon. Just letting you know.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:45:30] Tvetold House foyer | I saw him look at me for a few seconds, then close the door and walk into the living room. I replied to Dad, \"Okay.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:45:40] Tvetold House foyer | I opened the door again. I called out to Dad, \"Dad?\"\n[1984-12-02 19:45:45] Tvetold House foyer | I saw him turn around and look at me. He didn't say a word.\n[1984-12-02 19:45:50] Tvetold House foyer | I said to Dad, \"There's a parent-teacher meeting tomorrow afternoon, remember? Six o'clock.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:45:55] Tvetold House foyer | I heard Dad reply, \"Is there? Alright, yes, I should go to that.\"\n[1984-12-02 19:46:00] Tvetold House foyer | I saw him continue walking into the living room. I closed the door, tied my shoes, slung my travel bag over my shoulder, and walked to the bus stop.",

    "text": "[1984-12-02 19:56:00] Bus stop | I stood at the station. I saw the rolling hills behind me, and scattered glowing houses across the river valley. I saw the waterfall beneath my feet frozen into a massive ice dome, shining faintly in the dim light. I looked up at the stars. I thought the stars above looked like they were scattered across a frozen seabed.\n[1984-12-02 20:10:00] On the bus | The bus arrived. I showed my pass to the driver and sat in the second-to-last seat on the left side of the bus—I always take that seat if it's free. I saw the headlights cut a beam through the dark. There was little traffic; we sped past Solsletta and Rynsletta, followed the banks of the Hamresanden River, entered the woods heading toward Timenes, turned onto the E18 highway, passed over the Varø Bridge, went by the high school, and entered the city center.\n[1984-12-02 20:40:00] Grandparents' apartment | The apartment is located at the lowest point on this side of the river. To the left upon entering is my grandfather's office. On the right lies the living quarters—two living rooms, a kitchen, and a small bathroom. The second floor is also divided into two parts: to the right is an unfinished, extremely spacious attic; on the other side is a single room—that’s where I live. There I have a bed, a desk, a small sofa and coffee table, a record player, a shelf holding records, a stack of school textbooks, some magazines and music periodicals, and a wardrobe containing a pile of clothes.\n[1984-12-02 20:40:10] Grandparents' apartment | The house is very old. It once belonged to my father's grandmother—my great-grandmother—who passed away here. I can somewhat understand my father now; during his upbringing, he was closest to his grandmother and spent much of his time here. To me, she is like a ghost from mythology—strong, authoritative, opinionated, mother of three sons, one of whom is my grandfather. In all the photographs I've seen of her, she always wears a black dress with buttons fastened tightly up to her neck. In the final years of her life, she suffered from senile dementia, which lasted nearly ten years beginning around 1870, and within the family they began calling her \"the old fool.\"\n[1984-12-02 20:40:20] Grandparents' apartment | I took off my boots and climbed the steep staircase that resembled a ladder, entered my room. I turned on the heater. Turned on the record player. I lay down on the bed and started reading. The book I was reading was Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which I had already read once the previous year, but this time it felt just as thrilling and intense. I felt a bit cold. Listening to Echo and the Bunnymen’s Heaven Up Here.\n[1984-12-02 23:30:00] Grandparents' apartment | I lay quietly reading until half past eleven, then brushed my teeth, undressed, and went to bed. I heard the city outside my window accompanied by a steady, low hum from passing cars, fading out of consciousness and occasionally returning without awareness, as if I myself were in motion.\n[1984-12-05 07:00:00] Grandparents' apartment | Until high school, I always woke up in such a house—my parents already up and rushing off to work, the air filled with the smell of tobacco, coffee brewing, radio playing, breakfast being eaten, car engines warming up in the darkness outside. Waking up there in the morning felt completely different—being alone in the apartment seemed not only to leave the surroundings empty, but also something inside me. It was an entirely different atmosphere, and I loved it.\n[1984-12-05 07:30:00] On the way to school | Most high school students came from the city or surrounding areas; only a few of us, including myself, were from rural areas. So in October of that year, I started smoking. After school, walking back to where I stayed posed no problem. First because most days I either headed to training at Tvet or met up with Vallund, and second because no one saw me, so no one could know that I spent all those nights alone in the apartment. Walking less than a kilometer through the old residential neighborhood to high school was something I enjoyed too—my mind would fill with pleasant thoughts, as if I were someone important. But that was also a major disadvantage. This constant clustering together in groups made every break between classes problematic: Where should I stand? Where should I go? I could sit in the library reading or stay in the classroom pretending to look over homework, but both options sent a signal that I was an outsider. Not because I wanted to, nor because I wished to appear tough, but simply because I had somewhere to be. Being alone was the thing I feared most in the world.\n[1984-12-05 08:30:00] Classroom | Our class had four boys and twenty-six girls. I sat in the back corner next to Baasen, with Moeller sitting in front of me, and Boer at the front of our row. The rest of the classroom was filled entirely with girls—twenty-six sixteen-year-old girls. But in class, things were different. In class, I had my role, my place. There I could speak, answer questions, join discussions, complete assignments—I existed. There I followed along with everyone else; we were all together. I didn’t draw attention to myself, so no one objected to my presence.\n[1984-12-05 08:35:00] Classroom | Monica, whose parents are Hungarian Jews. Elsa Ingrid, a pretty girl from Vågå who sings in the choir, a Christian, rather childish. Siv, with light blonde hair and long brown legs. Benedikte, her face sharply defined, features almost reminiscent of women from the 1950s, curly hair, dressed in upper-class fashion. Tone, graceful in posture, dark-haired and somewhat serious, she paints. Anne, wearing braces. Hilde, pale yellow hair, rosy cheeks, bold and outspoken. Irene, the central figure among the girls, beautiful yet instantly forgettable. Nina, so strong and robust, with a physique almost masculine in its sturdiness, yet dressed in distinctly feminine skirts. I liked some of them, but not enough to say I was in love. Monica was intellectually sharp and well-read; when we discussed the conflict in Palestine, she always restrained herself, speaking moderately yet firmly in defense of Israel—something I couldn’t quite grasp, since clearly Israel was a military state and Palestine the victim. It was pleasant just to be in the same room as Elsa Ingrid. Early in the semester, Siv remarked that the area between the church school and the business school resembled an American campus, and that’s when I first noticed her—because she knew something I didn’t, and I wanted to belong to this world. Siv loved boasting, and her laugh was unusually loud. Tone seemed more independent than the others. At a class gathering that autumn, I fondled and kissed Anne on the barber chair belonging to Baasen’s mother. Hilde still sometimes hesitated, often turning toward me.\n[1984-12-05 08:40:00] Classroom | Mette, short and slender, exceptionally intelligent. She loved Bruce Springsteen, always wore jeans, tiny in stature but constantly laughing, dressed provocatively and haphazardly, always smelling of cigarettes, showing her gums whenever she laughed—which aside from that flaw made her a pretty girl. But Mette’s laughter was peculiar—just after she finished speaking or was about to utter something silly, she’d let out a sharp consonant-like snicker. In fact, she was slightly tongue-tied, her speech a bit slurred, which naturally detracted from her beauty—in other words, she couldn’t truly be called beautiful. Around me swarmed a crowd of girls, a current of flesh, an ocean of breasts and thighs. Just watching their silhouettes behind the desks made me feel closer to them. In other words, my days gained meaning; I was happy to enter the classroom, to be among all these girls, sitting in the seat where I had the right to be.",

    "text": "[1984-12-05 09:00:00] School cafeteria/classroom | This morning I was the first to go downstairs to the cafeteria, bought a school-made sandwich and a bottle of cola, returned to my seat, chewing while flipping through a book. I watched students slowly trickle in, exchanging a few quiet words with Moeller. I saw them all moving sluggishly, faces still clouded with last night’s sleep, and soon the classroom filled up. Moeller lived in Hamresanden, and we had been classmates in middle school.\n[1984-12-05 09:10:00] school classroom | Then the teacher arrived, his name was Berg, wearing a simple smock. This was our Leivik class, alongside history the subject I did best in, my grades always between five and five plus, never higher. I decided I would aim even higher on the exam.\n[1984-12-05 10:00:00] school classroom | The teacher who taught us math and natural science was an old-fashioned figure. The math teacher was Vestby, whose entire body twitched; one arm constantly twisted and turned uncontrollably. During his lessons, I would put my legs up on the desk and chat with Båsen. At that, Vestby’s thick, fleshy face would instantly turn bright red, and he’d shriek my name in a sharp, grating voice. So I’d lower my legs—then as soon as he turned around, I’d start talking again. Natural science was my weak spot, and back then my math grades dropped as low as two. I never opened a book; the lectures were far beyond my comprehension.\n[1984-12-05 11:00:00] school classroom | The natural science teacher, Nergaard, was short and thin, almost like a shrunken little old man, with a devilish grin, though his yawns looked oddly childlike. He was nearly at retirement age. He also had muscle tics—one eye constantly blinking, his shoulders jerking up and down, his neck suddenly snapping backward. I thought these movements made him look exactly like he was mimicking an unbearable teacher—very funny. In the summer term he wore a light-colored suit, in winter a dark one. Once I saw him use the large compass from class like a rifle: we were all bent over our tests when he loomed above us, clamping the two arms of the compass together and hoisting it onto his shoulder, then pacing slowly through the classroom, stopping now and then, wearing a sly, mischievous smile.\n[1984-12-05 11:30:00] school classroom | I talked during his classes too, so often that eventually whenever he heard whispering somewhere in the room, no matter who it was, he’d snap, 'Grete Lundnes!' and raise his palm into the air—meaning I had to stand up from my seat and remain standing until the bell rang. I could hardly believe my eyes—was he out of his mind? But it actually pleased me, because inside me began to grow a rebellious urge to defy him: Screw it, that's how it is, what are you gonna do? I started planning to pierce my ear, shave my head completely. What did natural science have to do with me? Or math? I wanted to play in a band, to feel free, to live the life I wanted, not the life I was supposed to live.\n[1984-12-05 12:00:00] school | No one shared this view with me; in this, I was utterly alone. So right now it seemed unreal, something belonging to the future—and everything about the future felt formless. Not doing homework, not paying attention in class—it all felt equally meaningless. Before, I’d always been among the top students in every subject, always eager to show off my achievements. But not anymore. Now I saw those good grades as almost shameful, signs that you stayed home all day buried in books, head down—a loser. Leivik was different; it connected to writers, to artists. And it wasn’t something you could get just from reading books—there was something else to it: emotion, intuition, personal style.\n[1984-12-05 14:30:00] on the way home from school | For the entire class period I sat there scribbling aimlessly, smoked by the school gate during breaks, and when the final bell rang at half past two, I began walking home to my little dorm room. Within this routine, the sky and outdoor scenery slowly unfolded—the day passed. It was December 5th, the day before my birthday. I was turning sixteen, and Mom would be coming home from Baysang. Joy filled my heart. Living alone with Dad had been okay in some ways—he kept his distance as much as possible. He lived in Sandnes, I in town, going opposite directions. But that would end when Mom returned. Until New Year’s, we’d all live together again. With Mom around, the daily burden of facing Dad would be almost entirely compensated. I could talk to her. About anything. To Dad, I couldn’t say anything. It was impossible—we had nothing to talk about except practical matters, like where I was going or when I’d be back.\n[1984-12-05 14:45:00] grandparents' apartment | When I walked back to the apartment, I saw his car parked outside. I went in. I smelled barbecue smoke throughout the hallway, heard the clatter of cutlery from the kitchen, and the sound of the radio.\n[1984-12-05 14:45:10] grandparents' apartment | I poked my head in. I said, 'Hi.'\n[1984-12-05 14:45:15] grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him say, 'Hi, are you hungry?'\n[1984-12-05 14:45:20] grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, 'Yes, very hungry. What did you make?'\n[1984-12-05 14:45:25] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him say, \"Grilled pork chops. You sit down, it'll be ready in a moment.\"\n[1984-12-05 14:45:30] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I walked into the room and sat down at the round dining table. The table was very old; I guessed it had once belonged to his grandmother.\n[1984-12-05 14:46:00] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I saw Dad put two pork chops, three potatoes, and a small pile of roasted onions onto my plate. He sat down and began eating.\n[1984-12-05 14:46:10] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him say, \"By the way, any news from school?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:46:15] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I shook my head.\n[1984-12-05 14:46:20] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him ask, \"Didn't you learn anything today?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:46:25] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, \"No.\"\n[1984-12-05 14:46:30] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him say, \"Nothing at all.\"\n[1984-12-05 14:47:00] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | We continued eating in silence. I didn't want to hurt him. I didn't want him to think this was unpleasant, that his relationship with his son was strained. So I sat there trying to think of something I could say. But nothing came to mind. I felt he wasn't in a bad mood—no anger—but distant, absent-minded.\n[1984-12-05 14:48:00] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, \"Have you been to see Grandfather and Grandmother recently?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:48:10] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I saw him staring at me. I heard him say, \"Been there, stayed a short while yesterday afternoon. Why are you asking?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:48:20] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, \"Nothing, I just wanted to know.\" I felt a flush pass over my face.\n[1984-12-05 14:50:00] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I had already cut off all the meat with my knife as best as I could. Now I lifted a bone and brought it to my mouth, starting to gnaw on it. I saw Dad doing the same thing, beginning to chew on his bone. I put the bone down and drained the glass of water in one go.\n[1984-12-05 14:50:10] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | Then I stood up. I said, \"Thank you for dinner.\"\n[1984-12-05 14:50:15] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him say, \"The parent-teacher meeting starts at six, right?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:50:20] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, \"Yes.\"\n[1984-12-05 14:50:25] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him ask, \"You're staying here then, not leaving?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:50:30] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, \"That's the plan.\"\n[1984-12-05 14:50:35] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I heard him say, \"Then I'll stop by after I'm done and pick you up, and we'll drive to Sannes together. Is that okay?\"\n[1984-12-05 14:50:40] Grandparents' apartment kitchen | I said, \"Okay.\"",

    "text": "[1984-12-05 19:30:00] my place in the city | I was sitting there writing a composition in the style of a sports drink advertisement when he came back. I saw the door push open, heard the city's clamor suddenly rise, and detected heavy footsteps and his voice echoing on the floor of the entryway.\n[1984-12-05 19:30:10] my place in the city | I heard him say, \"Grete Lundnes? Ready? We're leaving right away.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:32:00] my place in the city | I packed all the things I needed into my travel bag and backpack, both bulging full. Since I’d be staying at home for the next month, it was hard to know exactly what I’d need.\n[1984-12-05 19:33:00] the stairs of my place in the city | As I went down the stairs, I saw him staring at me. He shook his head. I didn't think he was angry. It was something else.\n[1984-12-05 19:33:10] the stairs of my place in the city | I said, \"What about the parent-teacher meeting?\" It was as if he already knew the worst had happened, so I avoided looking at him while speaking.\n[1984-12-05 19:33:20] the stairs of my place in the city | I heard him say, \"What happened? Well, let me tell you. I got an earful from your math teacher. That’s what happened. Westby—was that his name?\"\n[1984-12-05 19:33:25] the stairs of my place in the city | I said, \"Yes.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:33:30] the stairs of my place in the city | I heard him say, \"Why didn’t you tell me about this? I was left completely in the dark. Truly astonished, I was.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:33:40] the stairs of my place in the city | At the same time, I began putting on my coat. I said, \"Well, what did he say?\" I was strangely relieved that Dad remained calm.\n[1984-12-05 19:34:00] the stairs of my place in the city | I heard him say, \"He said you put your legs up on the desk during class, showed no respect for discipline, acted outrageously, talked during lessons, neither read nor did your assignments. If this continues, he’s finished. That’s what he said. Is it true?\"\n[1984-12-05 19:34:10] the stairs of my apartment in town | I said as I straightened up, already dressed. I said, \"Yes, partly that's true.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:34:20] the stairs of my apartment in town | I heard him say, \"He said it was my fault, you know. He scolded me for having a son like me.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:34:30] the stairs of my apartment in town | I turned around where I was standing. I said, \"So what did you say?\"\n[1984-12-05 19:34:45] the stairs of my apartment in town | I heard him say, \"I talked back to him, gave him a piece of my mind too. Your performance at school is his responsibility, not mine. But of course it's unpleasant all the same. You understand that.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:34:55] the stairs of my apartment in town | I said, \"I understand. Sorry.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:35:05] the stairs of my apartment in town | I heard him say, \"It's no use. This was the last parent-teacher meeting I'm ever going to attend—period. Now, can we go?\"\n[1984-12-05 19:36:00] outside the apartment / by the car | We walked out through the front door and headed toward the car. I saw Dad get into the driver's seat and lean across to open my door from the inside.\n[1984-12-05 19:36:10] by the car | I said, \"Could you open the trunk too?\"\n[1984-12-05 19:37:00] by the car / inside the car | I saw that he didn't answer, but he did as I asked. I put my travel bag and backpack into the trunk, closed the lid carefully so as not to disturb him—he was turning the ignition key—and then I sat down in the front seat, pulled the seatbelt across my chest, and clicked it into place.\n[1984-12-05 19:37:30] inside the moving car | I saw him start the engine. I heard Dad say, \"Anyway, it's embarrassing. But what kind of teacher is this Westby, really?\" The dashboard lit up. The car ahead of us had already moved off down toward the river.\n[1984-12-05 19:38:00] Inside a moving car | I said, \"Pretty bad. He can't maintain discipline. Nobody in class cares about what he says, so no one listens to him. He doesn't reflect on his own mistakes or learn from them either.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:38:10] Inside a moving car | I heard Dad say, \"Did you know that he ranked at the top of his class during university exams?\"\n[1984-12-05 19:38:15] Inside a moving car | I said, \"I didn't know.\"\n[1984-12-05 19:45:00] Inside a moving car | The car backed up a few meters, pulled onto the road, turned around, and began driving out of town. As usual, I saw that he was driving fast—his hand on the steering wheel, the other resting casually on the gearshift beside him. The overheated engine roared; small studs on the tires made a steady whooshing sound as they rolled over the pavement. My stomach churned, yet a small wave of joy spread through my body because this had never happened before. He had never defended me. He never showed leniency toward criticism about my behavior. Every summer and Christmas vacation, when I had to hand in my school report card, I would start feeling anxious a week in advance. Even the tiniest negative comment would make him blame me and fly into a rage. Parent-teacher meetings were the same. Afterward, he would vent his anger over even the smallest criticism—like talking too much in class or being forgetful. And it was even worse when I brought home official school notices. Those were judgment days. Days in hell.\n[1984-12-05 19:50:00] Inside a moving car | I wondered—was it because I was nearly grown up now that he treated me this way? Were we finally becoming equals?\n[1984-12-05 19:55:00] Inside a moving car | As he sat there staring ahead while our car rushed down the road, I really wanted to look at him. But I couldn't, because then I'd have to say something, and I had nothing to say.\n[1984-12-05 20:15:00] Sannes' yard | Half an hour later, we drove up the final slope and entered the courtyard in front of the house. Dad didn’t turn off the engine—he got out to open the garage door. I walked toward the front door and unlocked it. Remembering the luggage, I turned back, just in time to see Dad switching off the engine. The red taillights flickered.\n[1984-12-05 20:15:10] Sannes' yard | I said, \"Open the trunk?\"\n[1984-12-05 20:16:00] Sannes' yard / inside the house | I saw him nod, insert the key again, and twist it. The hood rose like a whale’s tail and brushed against me. When I stepped into the house, I immediately noticed he had cleaned. I smelled the scent of green soap; the rooms were tidied, the floor gleamed. The dried cat droppings on the sofa upstairs were gone.\n[1984-12-05 20:20:00] Sannes' house | A few weeks after Mom moved to Baysang for her studies, he invited several colleagues over to the house in Sannes for a small gathering. He asked me if I could stay in town that night. If I felt lonely, I could always go to Grandmother and Grandfather's, as long as I wanted. That morning, he stopped by and brought me a bag of food—baked pizza, cola, and french fries—that I could eat in front of the TV. Of course he cleaned—the reason being that Mom was coming home. He wouldn’t otherwise go to such lengths to clean for himself, since his place had always been messy and unpleasant. Now I felt much more at ease. The house was back in its former orderly state. It wasn’t just due to my personal inner turmoil or anything else—I was disturbed by multiple factors, especially because this disturbance wasn’t singular. Something had changed in him this autumn. Perhaps it was because of our lifestyle—just the two of us living together—but clearly, it wasn’t only that. He’d never had any friends, nor did anyone ever visit us except family. The only people he knew were colleagues and neighbors—which meant, at Rocky that was the case, but here, he didn’t even know his neighbors. Being alone is the thing I fear most in the world.\n[1984-12-05 20:25:00] Sannes' house | The next morning I took the bus to Vallund, stayed there for a few hours, then continued back home by bus. The door was locked. I opened the garage to check whether he had gone for a walk or driven off. The garage was empty. I returned to the front of the house and unlocked the door. I squatted down beside the small pile of records—some leaning against a chair leg, others scattered on the floor nearby. I stood up and walked into the kitchen. There were unwashed cups and dishes in the sink. I opened the refrigerator; in the front row were several bottles of white wine and some beer, almost all empty. I went upstairs. Dad’s bedroom door was open, so I went in. I saw that Mom’s bed had also been moved in and placed right next to Dad’s. My room was untouched. I packed the things I wanted to take and headed back to town. On the living room table stood several wine bottles, the ashtray filled with cigarette butts. Though not cleaned up, it didn’t look too bad. The stereo system, which was usually stored in the attic, now sat on a small table beside the fireplace. Everything here bore some trace of unfamiliarity. I thought they must have had a little party. I remembered these records—he’d listened to them for many years: Pink Floyd, Joe Dassin, Arja Saijonmaa, Marie Hauken, Elvis, Bach, Vivaldi. Those last two tapes, he must have played either just before the party or earlier that morning. The other music wasn’t especially suited for such a gathering. Because of the drinking, the party must have lasted late into the night. The house is in a remote location, and taking a taxi into town or to Dad’s workplace in Vennesla isn’t cheap, so someone probably stayed over. Although I had planned to stay overnight myself.\n[1984-12-05 20:30:00] Sannes' house | Another time I returned there unannounced. After training, I didn’t feel like going back to town, so my teammate Tom drove me home. In the light from the kitchen, I saw Dad sitting at the table, one hand propping up his head, a bottle of liquor in front of him. I didn’t want him to know I’d seen him, but I couldn’t turn back. So I deliberately stomped and kicked the snow off my boots loudly at the door, flung it open, then slammed it shut behind me, making it unmistakably clear that I had just arrived. I turned on both faucets in the bathroom and sat inside waiting for a few minutes. When I entered the kitchen, it was empty. An empty glass stood on the counter, an empty liquor bottle tucked into the cabinet beneath the sink. Dad had returned to the apartment underneath the granary where he lived. It was evening. This was new. He had never gotten drunk before—at least not while I was around, and certainly never alone. Now I had seen it.\n[1984-12-05 20:35:00] Outside Solstua Shop / Sannes' house | One afternoon earlier that day, I saw him drive past the shop at Solstua. I had skipped the last three classes, and before heading to Rogaland for training that evening, I stopped by Vallund. As I sat smoking on the bench outside the shop, Dad’s snot-green Ascona drove past—I couldn’t have mistaken it. The car kept going. I tossed away my cigarette. There was no reason to hide, and as the car passed, I stared straight at it, even raised a hand in greeting. But he didn’t see me—he was talking to the person sitting beside him. When he came to my place the next day, I mentioned it. He said it was a colleague, and that they had been working together on a project at our house for a few hours after school. As if this weren’t mysterious enough.\n[1984-12-05 20:40:00] Sannes' house | During this period, he had frequent contact with colleagues. One weekend they attended a lecture together in Hofden. He went to gatherings far more often than I could ever recall before. Certainly, it must be because he felt bored or disliked being alone for long stretches. I was glad about it. By then, I began to see him differently—not as a child sees a parent, but through the eyes of someone on the verge of adulthood. For a moment, I truly wished he had many friends and colleagues around him, just like anyone else. Yet at the same time, I disliked this change—it made him unpredictable. In fact, his unusually defending me at a parent-teacher meeting belonged precisely to this category of unpredictability. Yes, perhaps that was the most striking thing of all.\n[1984-12-05 20:50:00] Second-floor room at Sannes' house | I took my clothes out of the suitcase and put them into the wardrobe, slid each record into the rack on the desk, and neatly stacked my school textbooks into a pile. The house was built in the mid-19th century, and all the floorboards creaked. These sounds ran through every wall, so I didn’t just know Dad was in the living room downstairs—I also knew he was sitting on the sofa. I had intended to finish reading Dracula, but I realized I couldn’t settle down to read until I’d clarified the situation between Dad and me. Naturally, he knew what I was doing, and I knew what he was doing.",

    "text": "[1984-12-05 21:00:00] Stairs / Kitchen at Sannes' house | So I went downstairs and wandered into the kitchen—maybe there was something to eat? And why couldn’t I just go down and say directly, 'Hey Dad, I’m upstairs reading'? 'Why would you tell me that?' he’d ask—or at least think. But this awkward state of affairs needed to change.\n[1984-12-05 21:02:00] Living room at Sannes' house | As I approached the final steps into the living room, I saw him sitting there, holding one of my old comic books.\n[1984-12-05 21:02:10] Living room at Sannes' house | I said, 'Aren’t you going to eat anything tonight?'\n[1984-12-05 21:02:15] Living room at Sannes' house | I saw him quickly raise his head and glance at me. I heard him say, 'You go ahead and eat.'\n[1984-12-05 21:02:30] Living room at Sannes' house | I said, 'Okay, then I’ll be upstairs in my room afterwards.'\n[1984-12-05 21:10:00] by Sannes' desk | He didn't answer, continuing to read his 'Secret Agent X9' in the light from a lamp beside the sofa. I cut myself a large piece of sausage and sat down at the desk to eat it. I remembered that he rarely ever bought me birthday presents; Mom must have bought something for me in Baysang. But surely he should have prepared a birthday cake? Had he even thought about that?\n[1984-12-06 16:30:00] Sannes' kitchen | When I came home from school the next day, Mom was already home. Dad had picked her up from the airport, and when I walked into the house I saw them sitting at the kitchen table. At dinner I received a five-hundred-krone bill and a shirt Mom had bought me in Baysang. Meat roasting in the electric oven, candles lit on the table. She must have wandered through all the malls in Baysang trying to find something for me, finally settling on this shirt. Though she thought it looked nice and believed I’d like it, I knew I wouldn’t wear it—yet I couldn’t bring myself to say so.\n[1984-12-06 18:00:00] Sannes' living room | I put on the shirt, and we ate cake and drank coffee in the living room. Then I went to training, and when I returned at nine o'clock that evening, they had already gone to the storage room. I heard Mom was in a good mood, saying more than once how wonderful it felt to be back home. Henrik Inge called to wish me a happy birthday, saying he probably wouldn’t return until Christmas Eve, but then I’d get my present.\n[1984-12-06 21:30:00] Sannes' house | So I waited a while, then went to bed. I really wanted to talk with Mom alone, but it didn’t seem like there would be a chance.\n[1984-12-07 08:00:00] school / town | During these last two weeks there were many exams. I handed in my tests early and went into town to browse record stores or visit cafés, sometimes with Båsen, sometimes with some girls from class. There’s an exam at school tomorrow. All of this was coincidence—it couldn’t be interpreted as me desperately trying to stay close to them. Being with Båsen was nice; we were starting to grow closer. One evening I stayed with him, just listening to records in his room, yet I was filled with joy. I had a new friend.\nBåsen—or rather Lide, which was his real name—had chestnut hair, handsome features, and a strong appeal to girls. He wasn’t a country bumpkin, nor a heavy metal fan, but a music lover who liked Talk Talk, U2, the Waterboys, and Talking Heads. He never acted pretentious or self-important, because there was no showiness in his nature, no self-indulgence. He had never claimed the position he could have had.\nBut it wasn’t shyness either; rather, it was a kind of brooding introspection, a habit of stepping half a step back. He never fully let himself go or revealed his true self. Was it unwillingness, or inability? I didn’t know, though usually it was probably both.\nI was proud to call Båsen my friend—not only because of his knowledge, or friendship itself (though that mattered too), but most importantly, because I imagined his good reputation might somehow benefit me. Not any concrete advantage, perhaps, but looking back now, it was clearly true: if someone is excluded, he must find someone who can bring him in—at least when he’s sixteen years old.\n[1984-12-15 14:15:00] school | In this context, being excluded wasn’t an abstract metaphor, but a concrete, tangible act. There were hundreds of boys and girls my age around me, yet I couldn’t enter the circles they belonged to. Every Monday I dreaded the question everyone would ask: 'What did you do over the weekend?' You could say once, 'I stayed home watching TV,' or 'I listened to records with a friend in his room,' but naturally you wanted to give better answers, if you didn’t want to lose touch with others. Some people were shut out at first glance, and remained outside throughout high school. I absolutely refused to be like them. So much happened every day around us—I wanted to be one of them, to be invited to parties, to go into town together, to live their lives.\n[1984-12-20 10:00:00] school | The biggest test—the year’s greatest celebration—was the New Year’s party. During these final weeks, that was all anyone talked about. Båsen was going to friends he knew from Jæren, and there was absolutely no way I could tag along. And so, until the end of term before Christmas, I hadn’t been invited anywhere.\n[1984-12-27 15:00:00] Vallund's house | From Christmas to New Year's Eve, I sat together with Vallund, discussing what other possibilities we might have. He lives four kilometers below us at Sålesletta. This autumn he’s starting the pastry-making program at vocational high school. We wanted to go to parties and get completely drunk. As for getting drunk, that wasn’t really a problem. I played on the youth football team, and our goalkeeper, Tom, could handle buying alcohol for us—he wouldn’t object at all.\nAs for the party, though, it was a bit… The ninth-grade crowd was throwing gatherings in some nearby house—everyone knew those were wild, somewhat illicit events, absolutely unacceptable. Rather than that, I’d prefer staying home. There was also a group of people we knew well—some classmates, others from football—but that wasn’t an option either. The party was in Hamresanden, and we weren’t invited. Even if we could somehow sneak in, it still wouldn’t be ideal in our eyes. Then there were those living in Tvet, attending vocational school or already working—some of them had cars, seats covered in fur, and Oswick-scented air fresheners dangling from the front mirror, swaying as they drove. But we had no other choices. We had to be invited to a New Year’s party.\nBesides, around midnight people would come out and gather in clearings or crossroads, setting off fireworks into the sky to celebrate the new year. That required no invitation—you could just join in. I knew many kids from school were having a party in the Sæm region. How could we possibly get there? Then Vallund remembered the drummer from our band—a boy in eighth grade who lived in Høynes. He’d mentioned going to a New Year’s party in Sæm. Clearly, this was our last resort.\n[1984-12-31 14:00:00] Sannes' house | Later, two phone calls settled everything. That afternoon I returned home and, passing by my parents, said I’d been invited to a New Year’s party. I said, \"It’s a gathering organized by some classmates in Sæm. Can I go there?\" Tom would buy the beer for us. We’d sit with eighth and ninth graders in someone’s basement living room until midnight, then head outside to the crossroads where people gathered, find friends from our school, and spend the whole evening mingling with them. It was a solid plan.\n[1984-12-31 14:05:00] Sannes' house | Neither Mom nor Dad objected to my going. I heard Mom say, \"Oh, that’s nice!\" Dad said, \"Sure, but you must be back by one.\" I said, \"But it’s New Year’s Eve—can’t it be two?\" \"Alright, two then, but not half past. Understood?\" We were also having a family dinner at home—Grandma and Grandpa were coming, along with my dad’s brother Marivik and his family.",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 15:00:00] Raernesletta store / Sannes' house | On the afternoon before New Year’s, we biked to the Raernesletta store, where Tom was waiting for us. We handed him the money, then each carried back a bag with ten bottles of beer. Vallund hid them in the garden outside his house. I biked home. I stood for a while by the window in my room, watching snowflakes swirl past, the gray sky seeming to sink down among the dark trees in the woods. I put on a record, opened the book I was reading, and lay down on the bed. The wind was picking up outside. Mom and Dad were busy cleaning and preparing the house thoroughly so the evening family dinner would go smoothly.\n[1984-12-31 15:30:00] Sannes' house room / hallway | A little later I heard Mom knocking. I went downstairs into the room, closed the door, and grabbed the phone receiver. I heard Mom say, \"It’s Vallund on the phone.\" The phone was in the room downstairs near the coat closet. I said, \"What’s up?\"\n[1984-12-31 15:31:00] Sannes' house hallway | I heard Vallund say, \"Something huge happened—the damn Andersson·Helen Sterdal…\"\nAndersson·Helen Sterdal was his older brother. In his mid-twenties, he drove a souped-up Opel Ascona and worked at a solid wood composite flooring factory in Bøn. His life didn’t face southwest toward town like ours and most others’ did, but northeast toward Birkeland and Lillesand. I’d never interacted with people his age before. I knew of him, but didn’t really know who he was. He wore a small mustache and often sported aviator sunglasses. He didn’t look intimidating from top to bottom—his style was rather gentlemanly—but his behavior was the complete opposite.\n[1984-12-31 15:32:00] Sannes' house hallway | I said, \"What did he do?\" I heard Vallund say, \"He found the beer bag in the garden. Then the damn bastard started yelling at me. What a piece of crap. Total hypocrite—pretending to be decent but acting like a bully. He gave me a full lecture, saying I’m only sixteen, blabbing on and on. Then he demanded I tell him who bought the beer. Of course I refused. What the hell is it to him anyway? So he said if I didn’t give him the name, he’d tell my dad. A total fake, that bastard. So I had no choice but to tell him. You know what he’s going to do? You know what that asshole plans to do?\"\n[1984-12-31 15:33:00] Sannes' hallway | In the strong wind, I saw snow slanting down from the shed's roof like a light veil. Vaguely, I noticed a moving figure inside, and in the next second, his facial outline appeared before the window; he stared straight at me. I lowered my gaze and turned my head slightly aside. I said, \"What are you doing?\" Soft light spilled from the first-floor windows, almost mysteriously diffusing into the deepening dusk. It must be Dad, I thought, I was quite certain.\n[1984-12-31 15:34:00] Sannes' hallway | I heard him say, \"He forced me into the car, drove straight to Tom with those two beer bags.\" I said, \"Really?\" \"Fuck him, he's just that kind of bastard. He was thrilled. I felt completely sold out. Absolutely brilliant—he won big time, goddamn it, in the blink of an eye. That man deserves to go to hell—I really wanted to curse him out.\"\n[1984-12-31 15:35:00] Sannes' hallway | Then I glanced out the window again, but that face was gone. I said, \"Well, what happened then?\" I heard him say, \"What do you think? He cursed Tom out too. Then told me to hand over the beer. I did. Tom paid me back. I was just like some little kid. Like he'd never done this himself when he was sixteen. Hey, he really enjoyed it, didn't he? He was happy cursing people out, happy driving me there, happy giving Tom a good scolding.\"\n[1984-12-31 15:36:00] Sannes' hallway | \"So, what now? We can't go empty-handed without beer. That won't work.\" I said. \"Of course not. When I left, I winked at Tom. He understood. So after I got home, I called him to apologize. He hadn't done anything yet. So now he'll bring the beer over to you. He'll pick me up on the way, and I'll pay him.\" Vallund's voice came through the earpiece. \"You're coming here?\"\n[1984-12-31 15:37:00] Sannes' hallway | At that moment I first noticed the cat lying on the chair beside the telephone table. I saw it staring at me, then start licking one of its paws. The cat quickly turned its head toward the direction of the sound, but in the next second it relaxed again. I leaned forward and stroked its chest and belly. \"Yes, he's leaving in ten minutes. We'll probably arrive in about fifteen.\" Vallund said. \"I need to think,\" I said. The sound of a vacuum cleaner came from the outer living room.\n[1984-12-31 15:38:00] Sannes' hallway | \"You can't drive directly up here. That won't work. But we can leave the bags somewhere by the roadside. Anyway, no one will find them here.\" I said. \"Maybe at the bottom of the small hill?\" \"Down below the house?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay. Then tell Tom not to back up toward our place or go all the way down to the mailbox. A bit further up there's a turnaround spot. Can he go there?\" \"Alright. See you later.\"\n[1984-12-31 15:40:00] Sannes' living room | I hung up the phone and walked into the living room to Mom. \"I'm going over to Ciliavik's for a bit,\" I said, \"just want to wish him a happy new year.\" I heard Mom say, \"Go ahead, wish him a happy new year.\" As soon as she saw me, she turned off the vacuum cleaner.\n[1984-12-31 15:41:00] Near Sannes' house / Ciliavik's house | Ciliavik was one year younger than me, living in a house a few hundred meters down the road. Over the years we'd lived here, he and I had spent a lot of time together. Whenever possible, we played football—after school, on Saturdays and Sundays, during holidays. Often we struggled to gather enough players for a proper match; if that failed, we'd play two-on-two for hours; if even that wasn't possible, it would just be me and Ciliavik. I'd shoot to him, he'd shoot to me, I'd pass, he'd pass. Or we'd play against each other—we called it 'two-man football.' Day after day passed like this until I started high school.\n[1984-12-31 15:42:00] Ciliavik's house | We also swam together, sometimes under the waterfall where the pool was deep enough to dive from the cliffs, or downstream where the current was strong, then we'd float along with the water. On bad weather days when outdoor activities weren't suitable, we'd watch videos in the basement living room at his place, or hang out in the garage talking and joking around. I really liked going there. His family was warm, generous, and welcoming. Even though his father somewhat disliked me, I was still well-received in their home.\n[1984-12-31 15:43:00] School / Town | Although among everyone Ciliavik and I spent the most time together, I never considered him a friend. I never mentioned him to friends from other circles—not only because he was one year younger, which wasn't something to boast about, but also because he was so unsophisticated. He had no interest in music and knew nothing about it; he showed no interest in girls or drinking. On weekends, he preferred staying at home with his family. He thought it perfectly fine to wear rubber boots to school, loved wearing hand-knitted sweaters and corduroy pants shorter than jeans, and T-shirts printed with the logo of Vesfjord Zoo. Before I moved there, he had never gone into town alone.\n[1984-12-31 15:44:00] library/school | There were many books he had hardly read at all—mostly comic book series, the same ones I’d seen too—but for me it was more about that long list of MacLean, Bagley, Smith, Le Carré, and Follett novels I’d gulped down without much thought. Slowly, I began getting him to read some of them as well. Sometimes on Saturdays we went to the library together, or watched Stavanger football team’s home games on Sundays; twice a week we trained with our own team, and during the summer term we played a match each week. Besides that, we met daily riding the school bus to school. But we never sat together. We didn’t do that. The closer we got to school, the more connected to life there, the more distant Ciliavik and I became. As soon as we stepped onto campus, we had nothing to do with each other.",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 15:45:00] near Sannes' house | During the holiday between Christmas and New Year, I visited his house several times—we watched videos and skied on the hill behind our house. It was strange how little he cared about this. He was always so cheerful, open, full of humor, warm-hearted like his family. I never considered inviting him to my place on New Year's Eve—it wasn't even a possibility.\n[1984-12-31 15:46:00] Rogaland/school | Vallund had no contact with Ciliavik, though they naturally knew each other—everyone here knew one another—but there had never been any private friendship between them, nor any reason for one. When I first moved here, Vallund was very close to Magnus Nord, a boy around his age who lived in Rogaland; back then, they were best friends, constantly going in and out of each other’s homes. Magnus Nord’s father was in the military, so they’d moved around a lot—I knew a bit about that. When Vallund started spending time with me, primarily because of our shared interest in music, Magnus tried hard to win him back, calling him repeatedly to invite him over. When the three of us were together at school, he made every effort to show that only the two of them were true friends.\n[1984-12-31 15:47:00] airport café/Hammerfestanden | When that plan failed, he lowered his expectations and invited both of us to his house. We rode bikes around the airport area, hung out at the airport café, and called Rita, a girl from Hammerfestanden whom both Vallund and Magnus Nord liked. On the way up a gentle slope, Magnus Nord broke off half his chocolate bar and gave it to Vallund, not offering me any. But the gesture wasn’t appreciated—Vallund casually took half of his own piece and passed it to me. After that, Magnus gave up and turned to others, but throughout our entire time in lower secondary school, none of his friends ever came as close to him as Vallund had.\n[1984-12-31 15:48:00] school | Everyone liked Magnus Nord, especially the girls, yet no one wanted to be with him. Rita spoke sharply and aggressively toward everyone, but she especially liked him. They often laughed together in a particular tone, though they never became anything more than friends. As for me, Rita was mercilessly harsh. I always approached her cautiously, never knowing when or how she might attack. I saw her as small and thin, with a narrow face, a small mouth, but perfectly shaped lips. Her eyes, always glinting with mockery, were almost sparkling. Rita was beautiful, but that beauty wasn’t obvious—her manner toward others always felt uncomfortable, so perhaps her beauty simply went unnoticed.\n[1984-12-31 15:49:00] narrator's home (on phone) | I heard her say: 'Hi, Grete Lundnes, it’s Rita.' 'Rita?' I said. 'Yes, it’s me, Rita Lolita. You blockhead.' 'Oh,' I said. 'I’ve got a question for you,' she said. 'Oh?' 'Do you want to be with me?' 'What?' 'I said it once. Do you want to be with me? It’s a simple question. Just say yes or no.' 'I don’t know…' I said. 'Come on, just say it. If not, then say no.' 'I don’t think…' I said. 'Fine, no,' she said. 'See you at school tomorrow. Bye.' One evening she called me at home.\n[1984-12-31 15:50:00] school | She put down the receiver. The next day at school, everything was as usual, and she seemed exactly the same as always. She never brought it up again, and neither did I. I never mentioned it to Vidal or Magnus Nord either. Maybe she just wanted to double her chances of attacking me, seizing any opportunity that arose. I didn’t want to appear superior to them.\n[1984-12-31 15:55:00] Sannes' yard | After saying goodbye to Mom, she switched on the vacuum cleaner. I got dressed in the hallway and stepped outside, bending into the biting wind. I shouted, 'I’m going down to Ciliavik for a bit.' Dad had already opened one of the garage doors and was pulling out the snowblower. The gravel inside the garage was completely free of snow, while the same kind of gravel outdoors was covered in ice and snow. This imbalance between inside and outside stirred a familiar, faint discomfort deep within me. Once the yard gate closed behind me, I refused to think about it anymore—letting it vanish from my thoughts entirely—but whenever I saw it…\n[1984-12-31 15:56:00] hillside outside Sannes' house | Dad sat on the snowblower and turned his head to nod at me. When I reached the mailbox, I heard the machine above starting up. I turned to check if he could see me. It didn’t seem likely, so I headed down the hill, taking the opposite path leading straight down the slope. I regretted suggesting we meet at the bottom of the hill—it was probably too close. My father usually had a sixth sense for anything unusual. Besides, he’d already been watching me for a while now. Better safe than sorry.\n[1984-12-31 16:05:00] roadside at bottom of hill | At the very bottom of the hill, I stopped and looked across at the river while waiting. I heard a car turning somewhere a few hundred meters away. I glanced down the road, and when the car appeared around the bend, I raised my hand to wave. It pulled up beside me. Tom rolled down the window. Three cars drove past on the far side of the river, one after another. The beams from their headlights looked like yellow spots piercing the deep gray. The snow in the open fields reflected the color of the sky, and the light from the heavens seemed stitched together with the descending net of dusk. The water in the ice holes was pitch-black and glistened. The engine noise was dry and harsh—it must have been an old car. Tom’s, no doubt.\n[1984-12-31 16:06:00] by the roadside below the hillside | I heard him say, \"Hi, Grete Lundnes.\" \"Hi,\" I said. He gave a little laugh. \"Did you catch some hell?\" I asked. \"This goddamn mouth,\" Vallund sitting beside him chimed in. \"It's nothing important,\" Tom said. \"So you're going out tonight?\" \"Yes. What about you?\" \"Just a short round will do.\" \"Anything else?\" \"No, all good.\"\n[1984-12-31 16:08:00] by the roadside below the hillside | His kind eyes looked at me and he smiled. I walked to the back of the car, opened the hood, and from among the jumbled tools, toolbox, and a pile of perforated straps and hooks meant for repairing ceilings, I pulled out two red-and-white plastic bags. \"Your stuff is in the back.\" \"Is the trunk open?\" \"Of course it is.\"\n[1984-12-31 16:09:00] by the roadside below the hillside | He exhaled sharply through his mouth, as if to say it was nothing. He nodded, Tom rolled up the window and casually raised his hand to his forehead in farewell, just as he usually did, then started the car and drove off up the slope. \"I've got the stuff,\" I said, \"Thanks, Tom. We won't forget this.\" \"See you later,\" I said to Vallund.\n[1984-12-31 16:10:00] in the bushes by the roadside | I stepped over the snowbank by the roadside and into the thicket, walking about twenty meters up along the snow-covered stream until I reached a fairly distinctive birch tree, where I left the bag with the alcohol. Now I heard the car had passed onto the main road and was driving away downhill.\n[1984-12-31 16:15:00] outside the Sannes house | I stood at the edge of the woods for a few minutes, then walked up the slope. Dad was vigorously clearing snow from the driveway, widening the path. When I approached, I nodded to him; he glanced at me with an expressionless face. He wasn’t wearing a hat or gloves, walking behind the machine in an old lambskin jacket, a thick scarf loosely wrapped around his neck. The shoveled snow didn’t blow away in the wind but fell with a swish a few meters off to the side. So that this outing wouldn’t seem suspiciously brief.\n[1984-12-31 16:30:00] Sannes' kitchen | After hanging my coat in the hallway, I went into the kitchen where Mom was sitting, smoking. The candle on the windowsill flickered in the dim light. The clock on the electric stove showed half past three.\n[1984-12-31 16:31:00] Sannes' kitchen | \"Everything’s fine, right?\" I said. \"Yes,\" she said, \"It’ll definitely be a pleasant dinner. Won’t you eat something before heading out again?\" \"I’ll have a few slices of bread,\" I said. On the counter sat a large white bag containing lutefisk. In the sink nearby were piled dark, unwashed potatoes. In the corner, the coffee maker glowed, and the pot still held half a pot of coffee.\n[1984-12-31 16:32:00] Sannes' kitchen/living room | I went into the living room and stood by the window, gazing out across the entire valley. \"I think I'll wait a bit,\" I said. \"I won't leave before seven. When are they arriving exactly?\" \"Dad’s going to pick up Grandma and Grandpa—I think he’ll leave soon. Marivik will arrive around seven.\" \"Then I’ll make it in time to meet them,\" I said.\n[1984-12-31 16:33:00] Sannes' living room | I walked over to the sofa table, picked up an orange, sat down on the couch, and began peeling it. The tiny lights on the Christmas tree twinkled, flames danced in the fireplace, and at the far end of the already-set table, light refracted dazzlingly off the crystal glasses.",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 16:35:00] Sannes' house | During the summer when Henrik Inge and I lived together, he was about to start his third year of high school, and he expressed a wish to finish school at the same place, staying with his friends there. Dad flew into a rage. But Henrik Inge didn’t give in—he didn’t move with us, and since Dad refused to give him a single krone, he applied for a student loan and rented a room not far from our hometown. I thought of Henrik Inge, wondering how he had experienced all this during Christmas back when he was in high school. At least now he has no issues. He’s at a cabin in Vetti, East Agder, with many of his friends. He returns here as late as possible—even on Christmas Eve—and leaves again as early as he can, departing on the third day of Christmas. He’s never actually lived here.\n[1984-12-31 16:40:00] Sannes' house | During the weekends he came to us, Dad hardly spoke to him at all. Their relationship had frozen over. A year later, Henrik Inge went off for military service. I remember one weekend when he brought his girlfriend Alvhild home—it was the first time in his life he’d done such a thing. Naturally, Dad kept his distance; only Mom and I spent time with them. At the end of that weekend, as they walked down the hill toward the bus stop, Dad drove straight toward them.\n[1984-12-31 16:41:00] the slope near Sannes' house | He stopped the car, rolled down the window, and smiled as he greeted Alvhild. There was something unusual in his eyes—something I had never seen before. His gaze was intense, filled with a kind of joy and excitement. He had never looked at any of us like that. Then he turned away, started the engine, and disappeared up the hill. We continued walking toward the station.\n[1984-12-31 16:45:00] Sannes' house | That’s how things were during those weekends—every effort Mom made to make Henrik Inge feel welcome came to nothing. Was this our father? The warmth and care Mom showed Alvhild and Henrik Inge throughout that weekend suddenly felt diminished by Dad’s four-second stare. Perhaps this is also why Henrik Inge almost always came alone during those weekends—Dad stayed as much as possible in his cabin at the warehouse, appearing only at mealtimes, never asking him a single question, barely acknowledging him.\n[1984-12-31 16:50:00] a room in Sannes' house | I stood up, holding the orange peel, walked into the kitchen where Mom was standing peeling potatoes, opened the cabinet beside her and tossed the peel into the trash, saw Dad walk past while running his hand through his hair and smoothing it back, stepped onto the stairs and went into my room, closed the door behind me, put on a record, and lay down on the bed. Outside, the sound of the snowblower abruptly stopped. It was Dad who set the tone in this house. Everyone remained silent, no one objected. That gesture was so uniquely his.\n[1984-12-31 17:00:00] Sannes' house | We discussed for a while how we could get to Sæm. Vallund’s father and my mother were both willing to drive us there, as long as we told them our plans quickly. But then there were those two full bags of beer—so that option was out of the question. In the end, we came up with a solution: Vallund would go home saying my mother drove us, while I would say it was Vallund’s father. It was a bit risky, since our parents might meet later and expose the lie, but we decided to take the chance anyway. Once we’d agreed on that, the next issue was how to travel. On New Year’s Eve, the buses here stopped running, but we found a workaround—we could head to the Timenes crossroads, about ten kilometers from here. We’d hitchhike there—if we were lucky, catch one ride all the way; if not, transfer to a bus from there. To avoid questions or suspicion, it was best to wait until the guests arrived before making our move. That meant seven o’clock. The bus left at eight ten—that had to be the plan. Everything seemed fine, provided we had some luck.\n[1984-12-31 19:15:00] the road near Sannes | I placed the bag I was carrying on the road, opened my jacket and pulled out my scarf, wrapped it around my face and tied it securely, then grabbed the bag again and continued forward. I began jogging downhill. The wind roared in my ears, whipping up swirling snowflakes that danced wildly in the air. The bags in my hands felt like lead weights. There are still four kilometers to Vallund’s place, so I need to pick up the pace.\n[1984-12-31 19:20:00] roadside | I stopped, propped one foot on the edge of the roadside ditch, carefully placed the bag down on the bank below me, then continued walking. When a car passed me, I turned to look—a strange old man sat in the driver’s seat. On the other side of the road, around the bend, headlights appeared. The light cut through the trees. The tall trees standing there flashed into view, one after another.\n[1984-12-31 19:25:00] roadside | I walked back about twenty meters, picked up the bag from the bank, and continued downward, rounded a bend, passed a house where an elderly person lived alone, crossed an open field, passed the abandoned little farm lying dark and silent in the night, and just before reaching the last house before the main road intersection, another car appeared on the road. There, I could see the faint glow of lights from the factory, blurred within the thick darkness of falling snow.\n[1984-12-31 19:30:00] roadside | I took the same precaution as before, quickly placing the bag on the bank and continuing forward empty-handed. As soon as the car passed, I ran back, grabbed the bottle-filled bag, and quickened my pace even more; it was already half past seven. This one wasn’t Marivik either.\n[1984-12-31 19:32:00] roadside | I hurried down the road, nearly reaching the main road, when three more cars approached. I once again set down the bag in my hands. Two cars followed each other across the bridge, while the third turned and drove past me. Let it be Marivik, I thought, because then he’d pass quickly, and I wouldn’t have to hide the beer bottles for every single car. But it wasn’t Marivik. Not him.\n[1984-12-31 19:35:00] main road uphill | I picked up the bag and walked onto the main road, following the pavement past the bus stop, an old shop, the auto repair station, and those clusters of old-fashioned houses. Just as I was nearly reaching the top of this long, grueling hill, I saw headlights appear at the edge of the road. There was no ditch, so I placed the bag on the snowbank where it would be visible—there had to be several meters between it and me, at least. Everything was bathed in light, in the grip of a strong, biting wind, and the world seemed utterly empty.\n[1984-12-31 19:36:00] main road uphill | As the car passed, I glanced into the window. This time it was Marivik sitting there. At the same moment, he turned his head and saw me; when he recognized me, he hit the brakes. The car slowed on the downhill stretch, finally stopping some twenty meters below, then immediately reversed back up. Snowmud sprayed from the rear tires, brake lights flashing red. The engine gave a low hum.\n[1984-12-31 19:36:10] beside Marivik's car | The car stopped beside me, and he opened the door. I heard him say, \"It's you out walking in this bloody weather!\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:15] beside Marivik's car | \"Oh, yes,\" I said. \"So, where are you headed?\" \"To a party.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:20] beside Marivik's car | I heard him say, \"Come on, get in, I'll drive you there.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:25] beside Marivik's car | \"No, no need,\" I said, \"It's not far now, I'm fine.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:30] beside Marivik's car | I heard Marivik say, \"No, that won't do—get in.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:35] beside Marivik's car | I shook my head. \"You're out late too,\" I said, \"It's already past half past seven.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:40] beside Marivik's car | I heard Marivik say, \"Doesn't matter, no problem—get in, right now. It's New Year's Eve, you don't need to freeze out here, you know. We'll take you. End of discussion.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:36:45] beside Marivik's car | \"Well, okay,\" I said, \"you're very kind.\" I couldn't keep refusing—he'd grow suspicious.\n[1984-12-31 19:36:50] beside Marivik's car | I heard him chuckle. \"You sit in the back,\" he said, \"just guide me on the way.\"",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 19:37:00] inside Marivik's car | I opened the door and got into the back seat. It was warm and comfortable inside the car. Harald, their three-year-old son, sat silently in his child seat, following me with his eyes.\n[1984-12-31 19:37:05] inside Marivik's car | I smiled at him. \"Hi, Harald,\" I said.\n[1984-12-31 19:37:10] inside Marivik's car | I saw Tove in the front passenger seat turn toward me. I heard her say, \"Hi, Grete Lundnes, it's so good to see you.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:37:15] inside Marivik's car | I said, \"Hi, Merry Christmas.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:37:20] inside Marivik's car | I nodded. I heard Marivik say, \"So we're off then? I suppose we'll have to take another route?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:38:00] inside Marivik's car | We drove down to the bus stop below, turned around, and started driving back up the hill. I saw the bags lying there, and as we passed the spot where the beer bags had been, I leaned forward, searching for them. I couldn't help myself.\n[1984-12-31 19:38:10] inside Marivik's car | I heard Marivik ask, \"Where are you headed?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:38:15] inside Marivik's car | I said, \"First down to a friend's place at Solsletta. Then we're going to Sem, there's a party there.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:38:20] inside Marivik's car | I saw Tove look at him. I heard him say, \"I can drive you all the way there, if you'd like.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:38:25] inside Marivik's car | I said, \"No, there's no need for that. Besides, we're supposed to meet the others on the bus.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:38:30] inside Marivik's car | I knew Marivik was ten years younger than my father and worked as an accountant at a company in town. He was the only son who followed in his father’s footsteps; the other two became teachers—my dad at a high school in Vennesla, and Erling at a junior high in Thomas Linddalheim. Erling was the only one we called 'Uncle,' and he was more low-key, not drawn to status and recognition like the other brothers.\n[1984-12-31 19:38:40] inside Marivik's car | We didn’t see much of my father’s two brothers while growing up, especially Erling. Marivik was different—he had long hair, played guitar, and most notably, owned a twenty-horsepower Mercury motorboat moored at a summer cabin outside Mandal, where he stayed for extended periods each summer during our childhood. But we liked them. They rarely said anything meaningless, and Henrik Inge and I were especially fond of him—perhaps because he was the relative closest to us in age.\n[1984-12-31 19:38:50] inside Marivik's car | When he spoke about his companions there, it felt significant—not only because my father had no such friends, but also because we only knew them as people he met while out boating. Everything about them seemed almost mystical to me. We didn’t really know them at all, never having met them. I imagined scenes from their lives: endless boat trips weaving through skerries and islands by day, their long blond hair blowing in the sea wind, brown mustaches, smiling faces, playing cards and guitars in the evenings and at night, with girls always around.\n[1984-12-31 19:39:00] inside Marivik's car | After he got married and had children, although he kept the boat, that wild, free spirit faded, along with his flowing long hair. His wife, Tove, came from a police officer’s family in Trøndelag and worked as a primary school teacher.\n[1984-12-31 19:39:10] inside Marivik's car | I saw her turn her head toward me. I heard her say, \"Did you have a nice Christmas?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:39:15] inside Marivik's car | I said, \"Yes, it was good.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:39:20] inside Marivik's car | I nodded. I heard Marivik say, \"I heard Henrik Inge is home?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:39:25] inside Marivik's car | He loved Henrik Inge the most. I think this must have been because Henrik Inge was the eldest and had spent the longest time with grandmother and grandfather when Marivik still lived there. But it might also have been because, during our childhood, Henrik Inge wasn’t the sensitive type, unlike me who would cry at the slightest thing. Marivik was cheerful around Henrik Inge. That’s why, whenever I was with them, I tried to act tough against my nature, cracking jokes and saying funny things, trying to prove to them that I shared their temperament—that I had just as much humor and southern warmth as they did.\n[1984-12-31 19:39:35] inside Marivik's car | I said, \"He went back a few days ago—to go to a holiday cabin with some friends.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:39:40] inside Marivik's car | I heard Marivik say, 'Yeah, he's become an Aucity person now, you know.'\n[1984-12-31 19:40:00] inside Marivik's car | We passed the country church, made a wide circle around the canyon, and drove over the small bridge. I saw Harald’s eyelids drooping beside me. It was a place where the sun never reached. The windshield wipers tapped rhythmically against the glass. The fan hummed steadily.\n[1984-12-31 19:40:10] inside Marivik's car | I heard Marivik ask, 'Who started the gathering? I suppose it’s someone from your class?'\n[1984-12-31 19:40:15] inside Marivik's car | I said, 'Actually, it was a girl from our grade.'\n[1984-12-31 19:40:20] inside Marivik's car | I heard him say, 'Yes, when one starts high school, everything changes.'\n[1984-12-31 19:40:25] inside Marivik's car | I said, 'When you were studying at the church school, didn’t you change?'\n[1984-12-31 19:40:30] inside Marivik's car | I saw him turn his head and meet my gaze directly, then shift his attention back to the road ahead. I heard him say, 'Yeah, same with me.'\n[1984-12-31 19:42:00] clearing near Vallund's house | We drove into the clearing. The headlights cast beams of light onto trees and hillocks, the side walls of houses and the slopes, finally reaching the end surrounded by buildings.\n[1984-12-31 19:42:10] clearing near Vallund's house | The car slowed down and stopped. I said, 'This is the end of the clearing—you can park the car beside that shop over there.' I heard Marivik say, 'Okay.'\n[1984-12-31 19:42:20] clearing near Vallund's house | I said, 'Goodbye, happy new year!' I heard Marivik say, 'You too, happy new year.'\n[1984-12-31 19:42:30] near Vallund's house | I closed the car door and started walking up toward the house where Vallund lived, while the car turned around and drove back along the road we had come. When the car disappeared from sight, I began to run. Now we don't have much time.\n[1984-12-31 19:45:00] outside Vallund's house | I leapt down the steep slope onto their property, saw the light glowing from his room, and walked over to knock on his windowpane. A few seconds later I saw his face appear, squinting out into the darkness. I pointed toward the door. When he finally spotted me, he nodded, and I headed around the side of the house where the door was.\n[1984-12-31 19:45:10] at Vallund's front door | I said, \"Sorry, the beer is by Krag Bridge up there. Now we've got to hurry up and get it.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:45:15] at Vallund's front door | I heard him say, \"What the hell are the beers doing there? Why didn't you bring them with you?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:45:25] at Vallund's front door | I said, \"I ran into my uncle on the way here. Just before his car stopped, I barely managed to toss the beer bag into the snowbank. Then he insisted—damn it—on giving me a ride. I couldn't refuse, or he'd get suspicious.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:45:35] at Vallund's front door | I heard Vallund say, \"Oh God, we're really fucking cursed.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:45:40] at Vallund's front door | I said, \"Yeah, damn it, but now we've got to start moving. We need to hurry.\"",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 19:50:00] on the way to Krag Bridge | A few minutes later we climbed up the hill and reached the road. I saw that Vallund had pulled his hat down over his forehead, wrapped his scarf tightly around his mouth, and raised the collar of his coat to cover his cheeks. The only part of his face visible was his eyes, and even those were barely seen—just a tiny point when our gazes met. The round John Lennon-style glasses he wore were fogged up.\n[1984-12-31 19:50:10] on the way to Krag Bridge | I said, \"We've just got to move fast.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:50:15] on the way to Krag Bridge | I heard him say, \"Then let's go.\"\n[1984-12-31 19:55:00] on the way to Kråg Bridge | Taking slow steps, we began running along the path. Tears seeped from my nearly closed eyes. My weary legs couldn't instantly gather all their strength, and the biting wind hit us head-on as we crossed the open field. Swirling snowflakes danced and surrounded us. My feet started going numb, no longer obeying me—they stood stiff inside my boots, like pieces of wood.\n[1984-12-31 19:56:00] on the way to Kråg Bridge | I saw a car drive past. But in an instant, the car disappeared around the bend at the edge of the clearing. The speed of people walking can never compare.\n[1984-12-31 19:56:10] on the way to Kråg Bridge | I nodded. I heard Vallund shout, \"Shall we walk for a bit?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:56:20] on the way to Kråg Bridge | I said, \"Just hope the bags are still there!\"\n[1984-12-31 19:56:25] on the way to Kråg Bridge | I heard Vallund say, \"What did you say?\"\n[1984-12-31 19:56:30] on the way to Kråg Bridge | I said, \"The beer bags! Hope nobody's taken them yet!\"\n[1984-12-31 19:56:35] on the way to Kråg Bridge | I heard Vallund say, \"Who the hell would be out here now anyway!\"\n[1984-12-31 20:00:00] on the way to Kråg Bridge | We laughed. Stepping beyond the edge of the clearing, we started running again. Finally, we reached the spot where I had left the two bags. Each of us grabbed one bag and began walking back. Up the hill, where a gravel road led down to the fertile land by the river, across the small bridge, past the gorge, the abandoned auto repair station, the country church, and the white-painted little houses from the 1950s lining the road.\n[1984-12-31 20:15:00] near the country church | When we reached the church, we heard the sound of a car approaching from behind.\n[1984-12-31 20:15:10] near the country church | I heard Vallund say, \"Should we hitch a ride?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:15:15] near the small chapel | I said, \"Why not?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:15:20] near the small chapel | I held the bag in my left hand and stuck out my right thumb toward the road, and we stood there smiling at passing cars. We kept moving forward slowly. The headlights of approaching cars showed no sign of slowing down or stopping.\n[1984-12-31 20:20:00] on the road | I heard Vallund say after a while, \"What if we don't manage to hitch a ride?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:05] on the road | I said, \"We'll get a ride.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:10] on the road | I heard him say, \"Two cars have passed us in an hour.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:15] on the road | I said, \"Since you're asking, do you have a better suggestion?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:20] on the road | I heard him say, \"I don't know, but there's a small group gathered at Rickard's.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:25] on the road | I said, \"You shut the hell up right now.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:30] on the road | I heard him say, \"Andersson and Olaf Olaf went with some friends to Rogulund—also an option.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:35] on the road | I said, \"We already agreed on going to Søm, didn't we? You can't suddenly suggest we go somewhere else for New Year's Eve! It's New Year's Eve!\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:40] the road | I heard him say, \"Yeah, we're standing here by the roadside. How happy we are?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:20:45] the road | Another car came from behind. It didn't stop. I said, \"See that? Here comes another one!\"\n[1984-12-31 20:30:00] outside Vallund's house | When we stood outside Vallund's house again, it was already half past eight. When our eyes met, we kept walking forward. We left the residential area, passed the road leading down to the church below, turned a bend uphill, and walked past a small row of houses where a classmate of mine, Koller, lived. My feet were frozen. For a brief moment, I almost wanted to suggest forgetting about the beer, just follow him inside and spend New Year's Eve with his parents instead. Lutefisk and drinks, ice cream, cake, fireworks. That’s how we always spent New Year's Eve. I realized he had the same fleeting thought too.\n[1984-12-31 20:35:00] the road (near Koller's house) | I said, \"Do you think Koller went out tonight?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:35:05] the road (near Koller's house) | I heard Vallund say, \"I know—he’s at Rickard’s.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:35:10] the road (near Koller's house) | I said, \"That’s one more reason not to go there.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:35:20] the road | There was nothing particularly wrong with Koller, but nothing quite right either. Koller had large protruding ears, thick lips, thin light-brown hair, and angry eyes. He was almost always furious, of course for reasons of his own. The summer I started school there, he lay in hospital with broken ribs and a fractured wrist. He’d been in town with his father to pick up building materials, including several wooden planks they’d placed on a trailer hitched to the back of the car, but hadn’t properly secured. When they reached Varo Bridge, his father told Koller to sit out on the trailer to keep the wood from shifting. Then the wind caught the planks, flipping him and the load off the trailer, tumbling them across the ground until he was nearly beaten to death. We laughed about that all autumn. Ever since, whenever Koller appeared, that incident was the first thing that came to mind.\n[1984-12-31 20:35:30] the road | After he got his moped, he started hanging out with the others who had vehicles.\n[1984-12-31 20:36:00] the road | On the other side of the bend lived Olaf Olaf, a girl Vallund had always liked. She had a good figure, yet her boyish sense of humor and manner somehow made her breasts and hips seem less noticeable. Once on the bus, I sat in front of her. She raised her arms wildly, flailing them around like crazy, shouting, \"Oh, look at this hideous creature! Look at these long spindly arms! Can you see them?\" But the girls she was yelling at just stared straight at me, completely silent. Then she turned and saw me too, blushing—I'd never seen her blush like that before—because in that moment it became unmistakably clear whose disgusting arms she had just pointed out. It didn't matter to me.\n[1984-12-31 20:45:00] near the community hall | Below lay the community hall, then a short, steep slope leading down to the shop, beyond which stretched the long plain of Lein, extending all the way to the airport at its far end.\n[1984-12-31 20:45:10] Community Hall Station | I nodded toward the bus stop beside the Community Hall across the street. I said, \"I feel like having a cigarette. Can we stand here a while?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:15] Community Hall Station | I heard Vallund say, \"Go ahead—you can do it, it's New Year's Eve after all.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:20] Community Hall Station | I said, \"Well, shall we have some beer too?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:25] Community Hall Station | I heard him say, \"Here? What's there to celebrate anyway?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:30] Community Hall Station | I said, \"Are you feeling a bit down?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:35] Community Hall Station | I heard him say, \"What difference does it make whether I'm in a good mood or not?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:40] Community Hall Station | I took off my bag, pulled out a lighter and a pack of cigarettes, opened it, and used my hands to form a small windbreak as I lit a cigarette. I said, \"Come on, just one sip—right now!\"\n[1984-12-31 20:45:50] Community Hall Station | I offered him the cigarette pack. He shook his head. I said, \"Do you want one?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:46:00] Community Hall Station | I started coughing—the smoke felt stuck in the upper part of my throat, sending a burning wave piercing through my stomach. I said, \"Ow, damn it.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:46:10] Community Hall Station | I heard Vallund say, \"Feeling good?\"\n[1984-12-31 20:46:15] Community Hall Station | I said, \"I don't usually cough. The smoke just got stuck in my throat. I'm not coughing because I'm unaccustomed to smoking.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:46:25] Community Hall Station | I heard Vallund say, \"Really? All smokers get their smoke stuck in their throats and start coughing. That's nothing new. My mom smoked for thirty years—she always coughed when the smoke caught in her throat.\"\n[1984-12-31 20:46:30] Community Hall Station | I said, \"Ha, ha.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:00:00] Community Hall Station | A car emerged from the darkness around the bend. Vallund stepped forward and raised his thumb. The car stopped! He walked toward it and opened the door. Then he turned back and waved at me. I tossed away my cigarette, swung my backpack onto my shoulder, grabbed the beer bag, and started moving. Susanna got out of the car. She leaned forward and pulled the lever to slide the seat forward. Then she saw me.",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 21:00:10] By Torgeir's car | I heard her say, \"Hi, Grete Lundnes.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:00:15] By Torgeir's car | I said, \"Hi, Susanna.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:00:20] By Torgeir's car | Vallund was climbing into the dark car. I heard her ask, \"Do you want to put the bag in the back?\" The bottles in the bag clinked against each other.\n[1984-12-31 21:00:25] By Torgeir's car | I said, \"No, it's fine like this.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:00:35] Inside Torgeir's car | I got into the car and shoved the bag between my legs. Susanna got in. Torgeir, sitting behind the wheel, turned his head to look at me. I heard him say, \"You're hitchhiking on New Year's Eve?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:00:45] Inside Torgeir's car | I heard Vallund say, \"Well... we've just had damn bad luck tonight.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:01:00] inside Taiye's car | Taiye shifted gears, the wheels spun, and the engine roared as the car suddenly shot forward several meters. We rolled down the windows, and the car drove into an open field.\n[1984-12-31 21:01:10] inside Taiye's car | I heard him say, \"Where are you kids headed?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:01:15] inside Taiye's car | Kids. What a bloody idiot. How can he strut around thinking he looks great with that over-permed hair? Does he really think a mustache and curly locks make him look tough? Grow up. Lose twenty kilos. Shave. Get a haircut. Then maybe come back and show yourself. How can Susanna be with someone like this?\n[1984-12-31 21:01:30] inside Taiye's car | I said, \"We're going to Søm, there's a party there. How far are you driving?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:01:40] inside Taiye's car | I heard him say, \"We are only going to Hamre, there is a gathering at Helge's place. But we can drop you off at the Timenes intersection if you like.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:01:50] inside Taiye's car | I heard Vallund say, \"That's great, thanks so much.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:02:00] inside Taiye's car | I glanced at him. But he was staring out the window, and our eyes didn't meet. I heard him say, \"So, who's going over to Helge's then?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:02:10] inside Taiye's car | I heard Taiye say, \"The usual bunch—Ricard, Ekse, Moller, Yorg, Hebbe, Shedy. And Frode and Helen Ster, Jormos and Bjørn.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:02:20] inside Taiye's car | I heard Vallund ask, \"No girls?\" Taiye replied, \"Yes, yes, of course there are. You think we're all dorks or something?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:02:30] inside Taiye's car | I heard Vallund ask, \"Who are they?\" Taiye answered, \"Kristin, Randi, Katarin, Hilde... Inge, Elin, Anne-Katrin, Rita, Vibeke... What, do you want to come along?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:02:40] in Tåje's car | I spoke before Vallund had time to say anything. I said, \"We're on our way to another party.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:02:50] in Tåje's car | I said, \"We started out a bit late.\" I heard him say, \"At least you got a ride.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:05:00] in Tåje's car | Lights from the airport appeared ahead in our field of view. On the opposite bank of the river, just beyond the intersection we were approaching, a small speed-skiing slope near the school below was bathed in light. The snow looked orange.\n[1984-12-31 21:05:10] in Tåje's car | She sat motionless in the seat in front of me. I heard Tåje ask, \"How's business school treating you, Susanna?\" She said, \"Okay, well, how's your church school?\" I said, \"Fine.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:05:20] in Tåje's car | I saw Tåje glance quickly at me. I heard Tåje say, \"You're in the same class as that Møller, aren't you?\" I said, \"Yes.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:05:30] in Tåje's car | He laughed. I heard him say, \"The one with twenty-six girls?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"So, do you have class parties once in a while?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:10:00] in Tåje's car | Several cars moved slowly along the road, and we drove parallel to one of them for a stretch. Outside the window, on one side of the highway, a camping field came into view, covered in snow with no campers in sight. On the other side stood a country chapel, a supermarket, and an Esso gas station. Above the rooftops climbing up the hillside, bursts of fireworks lit up the sky. In the parking lot, a group of children stood around a tree stump, launching small glowing spheres skyward amid flashes of flame. Across the road lay the beach. The bay's surface was covered in white ice, with cracks spreading outward across the ice for hundreds of meters.\n[1984-12-31 21:30:00] in Tåje's car | I heard Vallund ask, \"What time is it now anyway?\" Tåje said, \"Half past nine.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:30:10] in Tåje's car | I heard Vallund say, \"Damn it. We won't make it through everything before midnight.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:30:15] in Tåje's car | I heard Tåje ask, \"Do you have to be home before midnight?\" Vallund said, \"Ha, ha.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:35:00] Timenes Intersection Station | A few minutes later, Tåje's car pulled up beside the bus stop at Timenes Intersection. We climbed out, carrying our bags in hand and stood under the shelter of the bus stop.\n[1984-12-31 21:35:10] Timenes Intersection Station | I heard Vallund say, \"Didn't the eight-ten bus already pass?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:35:15] Timenes Intersection Station | We laughed. I said, \"Definitely, but maybe the bus is late?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:35:20] Timenes Intersection Station | I said, \"Screw it, now at least we can have a beer!\"\n[1984-12-31 21:35:30] Timenes Intersection Station | I couldn't open the bottle cap with my lighter, so I handed it to Vallund. Without a word, he pried open the caps of two beer bottles and passed one back to me.\n[1984-12-31 21:35:40] Timenes Intersection Station | I wiped the back of my hand across my mouth. I said, \"Ah, perfect—if we knock back two or three now, it'll be like laying down a base for all the drinking later.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:35:50] Timenes Intersection Station | I heard Vallund say, \"My legs are almost frozen, man. Are you cold too?\" I said, \"Yeah, I'm freezing just the same.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:40:00] Timenes Intersection Station | I brought the bottle to my lips and gulped down as much as I could. When I lowered it again, only a few drops remained. My stomach was full of bubbles. I tried to burp, but no air came up—only a string of tiny bubbles returned to my mouth.\n[1984-12-31 21:40:10] Timenes Intersection Station | I said, \"Can you open another one?\"\n[1984-12-31 21:40:15] Timenes Intersection Station | I heard Vallund say, \"Sure, go ahead—but we can't stand here all night, you know.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:40:25] Timenes Intersection Station | He pried open another bottle cap and handed me the bottle. I brought it to my lips and closed my eyes with full concentration. Another large portion of the beer went down my throat. A fresh wave of burps and bubbles surged up immediately after.\n[1984-12-31 21:40:35] Timenes Intersection Station | I said, \"Oh, fuck, drinking too fast—this place tastes awful.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:50:00] Timenes Intersection Station | During these ten minutes we've been standing here, only two cars have passed, both heading for Lillesand. The road we're on is a major artery for traffic between towns in the southern region. Normally, vehicles pass frequently here.\n[1984-12-31 21:55:00] Timenes Intersection Station | I saw Vallund tapping one foot against the other, then switching and tapping the opposite foot back—repeating the motion over and over... Under the intense lights, snowflakes swirl wildly through the air. The falling grains reveal the presence of wind, rising and falling like waves—sometimes slow but steadily stretching onward, at other moments spinning rapidly into sudden vortices.\n[1984-12-31 21:55:10] Timenes Intersection Station | I gulped down the remaining little bit left in the bottle and tossed the empty beer bottle into the woods behind the bus shelter. I said, \"Well then, let's drink now.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:55:20] Timenes Intersection Station | I said, \"Let's have another one.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:55:25] Timenes Intersection Station | I heard Vallund say, \"You're about to throw up—take it easy.\"\n[1984-12-31 21:55:30] Timenes Intersection Station | He popped the cap off another beer bottle and handed it to me. I said, \"Fuck it, knock it all back. Damn, it's almost ten o'clock.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:00:00] Timenes Intersection Station | I heard him say, \"So what do we do now? We still have a long way to go. No more buses. No cars to hitchhike. Can't even find a public phone nearby—we could've called someone otherwise.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:00:10] Timenes Intersection Station | I said, \"We're going to die here.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:00:20] Timenes Intersection Station | I heard Vallund say, \"Hey! Here comes the bus. A bus heading to Aucity!\"\n[1984-12-31 22:00:30] Timenes Intersection Station | I looked up toward the hillside. I said, \"You're kidding again?\" A tall, beautiful bus emerged from the curve at the top of the hill. He wasn't kidding.\n[1984-12-31 22:00:40] Timenes Intersection Station | He stretched out his hand. The bus headlights flashed; the vehicle stopped and the door opened. I heard Vallund say, \"Hurry up, toss away your bottle, and smile nicely.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:02:00] Inside the bus | I saw Vallund hand the driver a hundred-kroner bill. I glanced toward the middle of the bus. I heard him say, \"Two tickets to Serm.\" Dark and completely empty.\n[1984-12-31 22:02:10] Inside the bus | I heard the driver say while pulling change from a pouch, \"You'll have to wait until after we arrive before you drink—that clear?\"\n[1984-12-31 22:02:15] Inside the bus | I heard Vallund say, \"Of course.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:03:00] Inside the bus | We sat down in a seat near the middle of the bus. Vallund leaned back and braced his feet firmly against the panel blocking the door. I said, \"Ah ha, great—warm and comfortable.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:03:10] Inside the bus | I heard him say, \"Mm-hmm.\"\n[1984-12-31 22:03:20] Inside the bus | I leaned forward and began untying my shoelaces. I said, \"Do you have the address where we're going?\"\n[1984-12-31 22:03:30] Inside the bus | I heard him say, \"Something like Elgstein—I roughly know where it is.\"",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 22:15:00] Bus interior | I took off my shoes and rubbed my feet between my palms. We arrived at that small, unmanned gas station. Then I shoved my feet back into the shoes, tied the laces, and by the time I finished, the bus had just turned into the stop in front of Varo Bridge. This gas station has always stood there in my memory; whenever we lived in Aucity and went to visit grandmother and grandfather, it was always a landmark signaling we were nearly in Vesfjord.\n[1984-12-31 22:15:30] Varo Bridge station | I jumped into the darkness behind him. I heard Vallund shout 'Happy New Year!' to the driver.\n[1984-12-31 22:16:00] Varo Bridge station | Although I've driven past this place countless times, my feet have never touched this ground except in dreams. Varo Bridge is one of the most frequent places appearing in my dreams. Sometimes I just stand beneath the bridgehead, gazing at the distant, faintly visible piers above, or I walk toward the bridge. Often the railings on both sides disappear, so I have to sit down on the road trying to find something firm to hold onto, or the entire bridge suddenly collapses, and I slide helplessly toward the edge of the roadway. In my younger days, it was Rocky Bridge that filled the scenes of my dreams. Now it's Varo Bridge.\n[1984-12-31 22:16:10] Near Varo Bridge | As we started walking, I nodded toward the bridge. I said, 'My father attended the opening ceremony of the bridge.' I heard Vallund reply, 'He was lucky.'\n[1984-12-31 22:25:00] Residential area near Varo Bridge | Our feet silently crunched through the snow as we walked toward the residential area. Normally the view from here is excellent—you can see Rogulun and further inward toward the other side of the fjord, and beyond that, the open sea. But tonight everything was pitch-black, as if inside a sack.\n[1984-12-31 22:26:00] Street in the residential area | Vallund turned to face me. I shook my head. I said, 'Look, isn't the storm calming down a bit?' He said, 'Seems like it. Uh, how do you feel after all that beer?' I said, 'No effect. That money was wasted.'\n[1984-12-31 22:30:00] Street in the residential area | After walking a while, houses began appearing all around us. I saw a group of people standing on a balcony, setting off fireworks. In one spot, I noticed some children waving sparklers in the wind, their sparks flying wildly. My feet grew numb again. With the hand not carrying the bag, I clenched my fingers tightly inside my glove. Some houses were dark and empty, others filled with people in festive attire. But this didn’t seem to help warm my hands much.\n[1984-12-31 22:35:00] Sem Crossroads | We stopped in the middle of the intersection. He pointed. I heard him say, 'Now up there is Elgstein—up there. Down there, and also down there—is Elgstein too. You can choose. Which path do we take?' I said, 'Are there four roads named Elgstein?' 'Looks like it. But which one? Now use your female intuition.' I said, 'What do you mean? Why do you think I have female intuition?' He said, 'Come on, Grete Lundnes, which way?' But we’ll soon reach our destination, according to Vallund. Female? Why did he say that? Does he mean I’m somehow feminine?\n[1984-12-31 22:36:00] Elgstein Road | I pointed to the right-hand path. We began walking down it. We’re heading to number thirteen. The first house is number twenty-three, the next one is twenty-one—we’ve chosen the right road.\n[1984-12-31 22:40:00] Outside Elgstein 13 | A few minutes later, we stood outside the family’s house. It’s a 1970s-style house, giving a slightly run-down impression. The path leading to the front door hadn’t been shoveled—hadn’t been cleared for a long time, judging by the winding footprints buried deep in knee-high snow along the path.\n[1984-12-31 22:40:10] Entrance of Elgåstien 13 | When we stopped in front of the door, Vallund pressed the doorbell. I asked, \"What's his name, the one who's hosting the party?\" Vallund said, \"Leif Norddal.\" I said, \"Leif Norddal?\" \"That's what he's called,\" he replied.\n[1984-12-31 22:41:00] Inside Elgåstien 13 | The door opened, and standing before us must have been the host. He smiled, pointed at Vallund’s stomach, then pointed at me with his index finger. I heard him say, \"Vallund!\" Vallund said, \"Exactly.\" He said, \"You're... Siv Viknes!\" I said, \"Grete Lundnes.\" He said, \"Awesome. Come in! We're all in here!\" I saw his very short light hair, acne on his cheeks and nose bridge, a gold chain around his neck, black jeans, a thick lumberjack-style cotton shirt, and white sneakers.\n[1984-12-31 22:45:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | We took off our coats in the hallway and followed him downstairs to the basement living room. I saw Larssen sitting on the sofa with his arm around his girlfriend Lene. When we entered, she smiled at us. I heard him say, \"Hey, you two! Great that you could come!\" Five people were sitting there, watching TV. On the table in front of them were scattered beer bottles, chips, cigarettes, and a tobacco tin. Lene was only in seventh grade, but she looked just as mature and beautiful, so uninhibited that her age difference didn’t even register.\n[1984-12-31 22:46:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | I saw Vallund sit down on the sofa and pick up a beer bottle. I stood leaning against the wall beneath the low window of the basement. I heard Vallund say, \"What are you watching?\" Outside, everything was covered in snow. He introduced a few people: Rune, Jens, and Elin. Rune was in ninth grade, Jens and Elin in eighth, and Leif Norddal, Larssen’s cousin, attended vocational school for mechanics. None of them were dressed up—just wearing plain white shirts.\n[1984-12-31 22:47:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | I saw Vallund shrug his shoulders. I shrugged too. I heard Larssen say, \"A Bruce Lee movie, almost finished. But we’ve also got 'The Lonely Guy,' 'Dirty Harry.' And Leif Norddal has some of his own movies too. What do you want to watch? We can watch anything.\" I heard Vallund say, \"I don’t care. What about you, Grete Lundnes?\"\n[1984-12-31 22:50:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | Larssen leaned forward from the sofa, picked up a lighter from the table, and tossed it to me. I pulled a beer bottle from my bag, placed the mouth between my teeth, pried it slightly outward so the cap rested just on my molars, then bit down. The cap twisted off the bottle. I said, \"Is there a bottle opener around?\" I couldn’t open the bottle with the lighter. And I couldn’t ask Vallund to open it for me—that would be too wimpy.\n[1984-12-31 22:51:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | I hurriedly drank it all in one go. I heard Lene say, \"Don’t do that!\" I said, \"It’s fine.\" Aside from the bubbles filling my stomach with air and having to swallow the many tiny bubbles rising back into my mouth, I didn’t taste the beer at all. I couldn’t possibly drink another one like that. But my feet reacted—warmth began returning to them.\n[1984-12-31 22:55:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | I saw everyone shaking their heads. Larssen raised his beer bottle into the air. The others clinked their bottles together in a chaotic round. They laughed. I said, \"Who’s got hard liquor here?\" I heard Larssen say, \"Only beer, sorry—but you can have another if you want.\" I said, \"I’m good, thanks.\" I heard Larssen say, \"Let’s get wasted!\" The others joined in, \"Let’s get wasted!\"\n[1984-12-31 23:00:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | I pulled out a pack of cigarettes from my bag and lit one. Pomoy Lights—wasn’t the strongest brand, yet this was exactly the one I’d bought. Standing there with this pure white cigarette, even the filter white, I regretted not getting Prince instead. But my thoughts kept circling around the party we’d go to after midnight, the one Irene’s class was holding, where Pomoy Lights would be less noticeable. Besides, this was Henrik Inge’s brand. At least once I’d seen him smoke it—some weekend evening in the garden when Mom had gone with Dad to his uncle Alf’s place.\n[1984-12-31 23:05:00] Basement living room of Elgåstien 13 | I walked over to him and grabbed a small handful of chips from the table. I saw him nod, his eyes never leaving the TV screen. I said, \"Can you open a bottle for me?\" I wanted another beer, but didn’t want to use my teeth again—I’d been told it would eventually go wrong, that my teeth would crack. Now that they’d already seen I could open a bottle with my teeth, maybe asking Vallund to open one wouldn’t make me seem too weak.\n[1984-12-31 23:10:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I returned to my spot by the window, holding a beer bottle. No one was speaking. He's been learning taekwondo this past year. I had completely forgotten about that. Every time he invites me to gatherings like this, I'm just as surprised all over again. Of course, I always politely decline. But this is Bruce Lee—watching his martial arts moves is important; he's the pioneer for all beginners.\n[1984-12-31 23:11:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I saw Larssen notice me and raise his beer bottle. I stepped forward two paces and clinked my bottle against his. As he drank, I watched his Adam’s apple bob up and down, as if counting each gulp he swallowed. I heard him say, “Sit down, Grete Lundnes.” I said, “I’m fine standing here.” He said, “Well then, at least drink up! Bottoms up, Helen Ster!”\n[1984-12-31 23:15:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | Among his peers, Larssen was unusually tall and strong, with a build like an adult man. He was also kind, seemingly indifferent to what went on around him, always calm and relaxed in his interactions. He was our band’s drummer—yes, he could do that. And he was with Lene—yes, he could be with her too. He didn’t talk much with her, mostly leaving her within his circle of friends, but that was fine—she simply preferred being with him over anyone else.\n[1984-12-31 23:16:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I once tested the waters, just a few months ago, curious how far I might go. Though I was two years older, she showed absolutely no interest in me. Honestly, it’s strange—me, someone surrounded by girls in high school, wanting to get close to a seventh-grader? But her breasts beneath her T-shirt looked so beautiful. I still want to touch them. I still wonder what it would feel like, my hand meeting her breast, regardless of her being in middle school. Nothing about her body or demeanor suggests she’s only fourteen.\n[1984-12-31 23:20:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I brought the bottle to my lips and drained it. I set the empty back on the table and cracked open another with my teeth. I really can’t do this much more, I thought. The carbonation filled my stomach, making it ache. One more sip and foam would start bubbling out of my ears. Luckily, it would soon be eleven. We’d leave by half past, heading to another party to last the whole night. If not for that, I’d have left already.\n[1984-12-31 23:25:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I saw Jens suddenly lift himself halfway off the sofa, grab the lighter from the table, and shove it behind his back. As he let out a fart, he flicked the lighter—a small flame whooshed up behind him. He laughed. Everyone joined in laughter. I heard Jens say, “Now we begin!” Lene said, “Oh, stop it!”",

    "text": "[1984-12-31 23:26:00] Small kitchen at Elgåstien 13 | I saw Vallund laughing, not meeting my eyes, clearly enjoying himself. Holding my beer bottle, I crossed the room to the door at the far end. I leaned over the counter. Behind the door was a small kitchen. The house stood on a slope, so the windows here were high above ground level, facing the garden below. Two pine trees swayed in the wind. A few houses were visible down below. Through one of the windows, I saw three men and a woman standing there, each holding a cup and talking. The men wore black suits, the woman a sleeveless black dress.\n[1984-12-31 23:27:00] Shower room at Elgåstien 13 | I walked to another door across the room, opened it, then closed it behind me before returning to the living room. I saw they were still sitting exactly as before. A shower room. A wet garment hung on the wall. There must be more, I thought.\n[1984-12-31 23:28:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I shook my head. He smiled. I heard Vallund say, “Did you feel anything?” I said, “No. Nothing at all. You?” He said, “A little.” I said, “I think we should leave soon.”\n[1984-12-31 23:29:00] Cellar living room at Elgåstien 13 | I heard Larssen say, “Where are you going?” I said, “Up to the crossroads. Everyone meets there at midnight.” Larssen said, “Yeah, damn it, but it’s only eleven now! We’ll come too. Hell, we’ll walk together.” He looked at me and asked, “Why are you going so early?” I shrugged and said, “I’ve got someone to meet there.” Vallund said, “We’ll be together. Don’t worry.”\n[1984-12-31 23:30:00] residential neighborhood street | When the clock struck half past eleven, we started walking toward the housing area. The residential area was quiet. Half an hour earlier, except for a few silhouettes on balconies or driveways, there had been no sign of people outdoors. Now it was alive with movement and energy. Crowds in festive attire kept pouring out from the houses. Women wore coats over their shoulders, held glasses in their hands, and walked in high heels meant for dinner parties; men wore overcoats over their suits, shiny leather shoes, and carried bags filled with fireworks. Children ran back and forth among the adults, many holding sparklers that crackled and glowed. The air was filled with their laughter and cheers.\n[1984-12-31 23:35:00] residential neighborhood street | Vallund and I each carried white plastic bags filled with beer. To avoid running into people I knew from school, I stayed a few steps ahead of them, pretending to look around casually. Beside us were a group of acne-faced middle schoolers dressed in everyday clothes, who had spent the evening together with us. I have to say, 'beside' isn't quite accurate. That way, anyone seeing us wouldn't assume we belonged together.\n[1984-12-31 23:40:00] residential neighborhood street | In fact, we were different from them. I looked well-dressed—white shirt with sleeves rolled up, styled the way Henrik Inge had shown me this autumn; a gray coat over my suit and black trousers, my Dr. Martens boots on my feet, and several thin leather bands wrapped around my wrist. My hair reached my neck, but the top was cut short and stood upright. The only downside was the beer bag in my hand. That part was annoying. It was precisely what tied me to those rowdy-looking boys trailing behind me, since they all carried identical plastic beer bags too—just like me.\n[1984-12-31 23:45:00] Sem Crossroads | People packed tightly together, most of them already drunk, all eager to launch their fireworks into the sky. The crossroads sat on higher ground, making it the natural gathering point, offering a panoramic view of the entire bay. Now it was utter chaos. Crackling firecrackers exploded everywhere, the sharp smell of gunpowder stung our nostrils, smoke hung in the air, and under the low-hanging clouds, colorful fireworks burst one after another. Trembling beams of light flickered, as if ready at any moment to burst into radiant, dazzling displays.\n[1984-12-31 23:50:00] Sem Crossroads | We stood outside the noisy, chaotic circle. I saw Larssen bring out his own fireworks and place a large wooden base loaded with gunpowder right in front of his feet. He swayed back and forth as he arranged everything. Vallund had started talking—he was now chatting with Rune. He always gets talkative when he’s drunk, a smile constantly playing on his lips. They met through taekwondo. His glasses were still fogged up, but he didn’t seem to care.\n[1984-12-31 23:55:00] Sem Crossroads | I stood a few steps away from them, scanning the crowd with my eyes. At the very first explosion of the rocket launcher, a burst of red flame shot out so close beside me that I flinched in surprise. Larssen roared with laughter. 'Not bad!' he shouted. 'Another one?' Without waiting for an answer, he placed a new rocket beside him and lit it himself. A string of glowing orbs then shot rhythmically from the launcher, evenly spaced and pulsing. He grew increasingly excited, almost frantic, fumbling to light a third rocket before the last orb had even faded. 'Hahaha!' he laughed wildly.\n[1984-12-31 23:58:00] Sem Crossroads | I saw a man nearby wearing a light blue jacket, white shirt, and a leather tie fall to the ground. A woman in high heels rushed over and grabbed his arm, pulling hard—not enough to lift him up completely, but enough to help him get back on his feet. As he brushed himself off, he stared straight ahead, as if in that previous moment he hadn’t been lying in the snow, but had simply paused to take a good look at his surroundings. Two boys stood on top of the bus shelter roof, each holding a rocket tilted outward. They lit them but kept holding on, sparks flying and hissing. The boys lowered their heads and turned away until finally hurling the rockets into the air. The rockets flew several meters before exploding with tremendous force, drawing the attention of everyone nearby.\n[1984-12-31 23:59:00] Sem Crossroads | He smiled and pried open the cap of the beer bottle I handed him. I took a drink, lit a cigarette, and checked my watch. I said, 'Hey, Vallund, open this one too?' He said, 'Ten more minutes!' Ten minutes to midnight. I finally felt something, but it wasn’t joy or darkness—it was mostly a rapidly growing drowsiness creeping into my awareness.\n[1985-01-01 00:00:00] Sem Crossroads | Vallund nodded and continued talking with Rune. I decided I’d wait until after midnight to find Irene. Before twelve, they’d all gather together—I knew that—hugging each other and wishing one another happy new year. They all knew each other; they were friends, a group, every high schooler had their own clique. I was distant from such circles, merely converging with them in this moment. But after twelve, those groups would dissolve. They’d stand around drinking, not in a hurry to leave, and gradually—within this slightly looser, unplanned state—I could stay with them, casually chat about something. Or at least not show any strong desire to blend in and become one of them.\n[1985-01-01 00:05:00] Sem Crossroads | There she was. I saw her standing on slightly elevated ground, perhaps thirty meters away, surrounded by a group of people in festive attire. The problem is Vallund. Does he really want to be with me? Those are people he doesn’t know, and I have more in common with them than he does. Doesn’t he look fine standing there talking with others? Well, I’ll just ask him. If he doesn’t want to, fine, then he doesn’t. But I absolutely will never step foot into his mother’s basement living room again—that’s certain. I tried counting them, but from outside that core circle, it was hard to guess who belonged to her group and who belonged to another. But one cluster was ten to twelve people—that much I’m sure of.\n[1985-01-01 00:06:00] Sem Crossroads | I had seen almost all of these faces before—they were the same group she hung around with during breaks. She wasn't tall, and in a way, resembled a duck. I wouldn't call her beautiful—she had a slight double chin, cheeks that were somewhat full but not quite fat, blue eyes, and blonde hair. But none of that mattered to me because there was always something else about her, most importantly, she was a central figure. Whenever she arrived somewhere and started speaking, she became *her*, and what she said always carried weight. Unless she'd gone to the ski center's cabin or some other big city, she went out every weekend—to town or private parties—with a crowd always trailing behind her. I hated those little cliques, truly hated them, and standing here listening to her recount everything she'd done lately, I began to hate her too.\n[1985-01-01 00:07:00] Sem Crossroads | I looked at my watch. Twelve o'clock. That night she wore a dark blue coat reaching down to her knees. Underneath it was a faintly shimmering light-blue dress and skin-colored tights. On her head was… yes, it must naturally be—a crown? Or like some damn princess? The atmosphere of excitement surrounding me grew thicker. Now came only explosions, roaring sounds, and people shouting from all directions, erupting everywhere. Then sirens began wailing, as if from the sky itself, as though God were bestowing his joy for the new year upon those he knew well. Cheers rose up around us.\n[1985-01-01 00:08:00] Sem Crossroads | Vallund and I made eye contact. He began slowly making his way toward me. He came over, wrapped his arms around me, and pressed his face against mine. His stubble scraped against my smooth cheek. He gave my back two hard thumps, then stepped back and walked away. He headed toward Larssen. He shouted, \"It's twelve! Happy New Year! Happy New Year, Grete Lundnes, thanks for the past year!\" I said, \"Happy New Year.\" He yelled, \"Larssen!\" No, damn it, is he actually going to hug me? No, no, no—don't do this!\n[1985-01-01 00:10:00] Sem Crossroads | She smiled at me, and I leaned forward and gave her a quick hug. She laughed. I heard Lene say, \"Happy New Year, Grete Lundnes!\" I said, \"Happy New Year. You look really nice.\" She said, \"What did you say?\" I said, \"Nothing, just thanks for the past year.\" She said, \"I heard what you said. Same to you—Happy New Year.\" Damn it, why did he have to hug me? What's so great about that? We've never hugged each other before. We don't do that—we're not like that. This feels absolutely awful here. Her face, which seconds earlier had been part of the surrounding joy, suddenly changed, her expression freezing.\n[1985-01-01 00:10:00] Sem Crossroads | When she turned around, I got an erection. I finished off the rest of my beer. Only three bottles left in the plastic bag. I opened one, popped the cap with my teeth, and started pouring it down my throat. I lit a cigarette too. One hand held the smoke, the other gripped the bottle. Then I stood there lifting both to my mouth—first a puff, then a swig. Smoke, beer, smoke, beer. Ah, perfect timing. I need to save them, but I need something in my hands. This is my gear—this is how I stay ready.\n[1985-01-01 00:20:00] Sem Crossroads | Ten minutes later, I tapped Vallund on the back. He nodded, and I began walking up the path toward Irene. She was standing with her back to me, talking to others. I had to tap her shoulder. I said I was going to someone I knew, would be back soon, told her to stay put. I said, \"Hey, Irene!\" At first she didn’t notice me—she didn’t turn around, maybe because my voice was drowned out by the surrounding noise. That’s bad—damn it, that’s just terrible. Touching someone’s shoulder isn’t a casual gesture; it’s deliberate. Now wait and see how they react.\n[1985-01-01 00:21:00] Sem Crossroads | Anyway, she turned around. I heard her say, \"Grete Lundnes, what are you doing here?\" I said, \"We’ve got a party nearby. So when I saw you up here, I wanted to wish you a Happy New Year. Happy New Year!\" She said, \"Happy New Year!\" I said, \"Having fun?\" She said, \"Absolutely! You?\" I said, \"Great.\" A brief silence.\n[1985-01-01 00:22:00] Sem Crossroads | She gestured diagonally upward with her hand. She shook her head while humorously wrinkling her nose. I said, \"You’re having a party, right?\" She said, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Nearby?\" She said, \"Yes, I live up there.\" I said, \"That house over there?\" Nodding in the same direction. She replied, \"No, the one behind it. You can’t see it from this road.\" I said, \"Hmm, could I join? Then we could talk a bit more? That’d be nice.\" She said, \"I don’t think so—it’s not a class thing, you know.\"\n[1985-01-01 00:23:00] Sem Crossroads | Then I turned and walked back. I said, \"I know, just for a short while? Not longer. I’ve got a party not far from here myself.\" She said, \"Then go there instead! We’ll see each other at school after New Year’s!\" I said, \"It’s good to see you—I’ve always liked you.\" She always shuts me down like that, leaving me clueless how to respond. Saying 'I’ve always liked you' felt awkward—it wasn’t true—but at least it shifted her attention away from my begging to join their party. Now she’d believe I only wanted in to get closer to her. That I wanted to get close because I was drunk. Who wouldn’t on New Year’s Eve? Bitch. Damn bitch.\n[1985-01-01 00:30:00] Sem Crossroads | When I returned, Vallund looked up at me. Vallund exhaled sharply, looking dismissive. I stared blankly at him and yawned. I said, \"No party—weren’t allowed in.\" He said, \"Why not? You said you knew them.\" I said, \"Only invited people. We weren’t included. Fuck it.\" He said, \"Then we’ll just go back. It’s fine there anyway.\" Let him understand just how fine it really was. But we had no other choice. We wouldn’t call his father until before two. That’s why, on this windy New Year’s night from 1984 to 1985, we ended up once again mixed in with that group at Sem—those acne-faced high schoolers dressed in everyday clothes.\n[1985-01-01 02:20:00] outside the Søm residential area | At two-twenty in the morning, Vallund's father parked his car outside this house. We had already been standing there waiting. I sat in the front seat, while Vallund sat in the back. I wasn't very drunk. Vallund—an hour earlier he'd been hopping around with a lampshade on his head—this was how we'd planned it. Fortunately, he'd already thrown up, then gulped down some water and rinsed his face under the tap, so he could manage to call his father and tell him where we were. He wasn't fully sober by any means—I stood beside him and heard how he shot out the first half of each word, because the second half always got swallowed—but at least he got the address across. On nights like this, parents probably don't expect us to stay completely sober anyway.",

    "text": "[1985-01-01 02:21:00] inside the car | As we got into the car, his father said. He rested his arm over the back of my seat, twisted halfway around, began reversing, then shifted gears and drove back along the same road he had come from. I heard him say, “Happy New Year, kids! Did you have fun?” I said, “Yeah, there were lots of people outside at midnight. It got pretty noisy. How was it at Tvet?” He said, “Peaceful and quiet. Who were you with, exactly?” I said, “Someone Larssen knows. You know—he plays drums in a band.” He said, “Ah yes, I know, I know.”\n[1985-01-01 02:25:00] inside the car | The snow outside some gardens was scattered with leftover firework debris. A few couples walked along the road. Several taxis passed by. Otherwise, everywhere was quiet and still. I’ve always liked the scene of sitting in a car slowly emerging from darkness, with the instruments glowing, and the person beside me moving with steady, confident motions. Vallund’s father is a good man. He’s friendly and funny, and once he sees that look on Vallund’s face—the one that says enough is enough—he leaves us alone.\n[1985-01-01 02:30:00] inside the car | He took us fishing, helped us out with all sorts of things—for instance, once when I biked down to their place and got a flat tire, he fixed it without saying a word; when I was ready to go home, the bike was already repaired and waiting for me. When they went on family trips, they invited me along. He asked my parents, and so did Vallund’s mother. In those days, he drove me home many times—if Mom or Dad was home, he’d always chat with them for a while, inviting them over to his place. They never came, but that wasn’t his fault. But I also know he has a temper, even though I’ve never seen him lose it. Vallund inherited all his emotions from his father—joy, sorrow, and even hatred.\n[1985-01-01 02:35:00] inside the car | I turned in my seat to look at him. He sat there motionless, his gaze fixed on a point on the headrest of the front seat. I said, “So that means it’s 1985 now.” I heard Vallund’s father say, “Yes, that’s right. What about you back there?” The car was turning onto the E18 highway beside Vårholmen Bridge. Vallund didn’t say a word. He hadn’t spoken when his dad first stepped out of the car either.\n[1985-01-01 02:36:00] inside the car | I saw him give me a small smile. I nodded back. I heard his father say, “Did you lose your ability to speak? Are your parents home tonight?” I said, “My grandparents and my uncle came over. Lutefisk and aquavit.” He said, “Glad you weren’t there, huh?” I said, “Yes.” Still no movement from the backseat.\n[1985-01-01 02:45:00] inside the car / near the Sannes house | We drove onto the road toward Rogaland, past Hamresanden, reaching the top of Reinsjøtå. Passed by their house, turned onto a curve leading up to Kragbrua, crossed the bridge and climbed another slope on the other side. His father drove slowly during the last stretch. Passed the house where Susan and Elise lived—two sisters who moved here from Canada, nobody knew why—and William’s house at the bend, then downhill, and finally up the last stretch. There had been no snowplowing; the ground was covered with a soft layer of snow about five centimeters thick. Darkness, silence, warmth, comfort. I thought, I could sit like this forever.\n[1985-01-01 02:46:00] near the Sannes house | Vallund blinked hard, suddenly opening his eyes wide. I slammed the car door shut, waved at them, and as I turned to walk up the sloping path toward my house, I heard the car reverse behind me. I heard him say, “I’ll leave you here, so you won’t wake them if they’re already asleep. OK?” I said, “OK, thanks for driving me home. See you later, Yev!” He said, “Alright, see you.” His father said, “Come sit up front.” He said, “No need.” “Yev”! Why did I call him that? Using a nickname means we’ve become real buddies. I don’t need to prove this bond, because we truly are friends—but I’ve never used that nickname before.\n[1985-01-01 03:00:00] Sannes' living room | After hanging my coat in the hallway, I walked into the living room. I sat down on the sofa and started peeling an orange. The cat on the wicker chair over there lazily lifted its head. When our eyes met, it rose gracefully, padded across the floor, and jumped onto my lap. I tossed the orange peel—the thing it hates most—to the side. The house windows were dark. They were already asleep. Every trace of the New Year’s dinner had been cleaned away. The dishwasher in the kitchen emitted a low, monotonous hum. I’m glad about this—not because I have anything to hide, but because I don’t want anyone interrupting me. Though the fireplace had gone out, I could still feel its lingering warmth. Mom was right—it feels really good to be here.\n[1985-01-01 03:05:00] Sannes' living room | I stroked it. It began to purr contentedly, curling itself into a ball on my lap. Its head slowly sank down, resting on one paw, closing its eyes with a satisfied expression, and fell asleep within seconds. I said, “You can lie here a while, you may. But not all night, understand? I’ll be going to bed soon.” I said, “You’re lucky.”\n[1985-01-01 11:30:00] Sannes' kitchen | I woke up the next morning to the sound of the radio in the kitchen, and after a while I fell asleep again. When I woke up the second time, it was already half past eleven. I got dressed and came downstairs. Mom was sitting by the kitchen table reading something, and when I came in she looked up at me. I heard her say, \"Hi, did you have fun last night?\" I said, \"Yeah, had a great time.\" She said, \"When did you get home?\" I said, \"Around two thirty. Vallund's father drove us back.\" But I just wanted to lie there and rest. Besides, what's the point of getting up this early today?\n[1985-01-01 11:40:00] Sannes' kitchen | I sat down and started spreading liver pâté on a slice of bread, tried several times and finally succeeded in spearing a pickle slice with my fork, placing it on top of the pâté, then picked up the teapot and shook it to see if it was empty. Mom stood up. She filled the pot with water and placed it on the electric stove burner. I heard Mom say, \"Is there any left? I can make more.\" I said, \"Just enough for a small cup, but maybe it's a bit cold.\" I said, \"Sit down, I can manage myself.\" She said, \"No, I'm right by the stove anyway.\" Immediately there was a hissing sputter of water hitting the hot plate.\n[1985-01-01 11:45:00] Sannes' kitchen | I heard her say, \"So, what did you all eat?\" I said, \"It was a cold buffet—I think her mom was going to a party, so she prepared that kind of food. You know, that kind... uh, shrimp and vegetable aspic, transparent...?\" She said, \"Cabaret?\" I said, \"Yeah, shrimp cabaret. And regular shrimp. Crab. Two lobsters—there wasn't enough to go around, but everyone got a taste. And, yeah, some ham and things like that.\" She said, \"Sounds nice.\" I said, \"Yeah, it was good. Then at midnight we went down to the crossroads below, where everyone gathered to set off some fireworks. Well, not us—we didn't set them off, other people did.\"\n[1985-01-01 11:50:00] Sannes' kitchen | I hesitated, looking around the table for something to eat with my bread, and said, \"Not yet, actually. Most of the time I stayed with people I already knew.\" I heard Mom ask, \"Where's Dad?\" I said, \"Up in the loft. He's going to Grandma's today. Would you like to come along?\" she asked. I said, \"Nah, better not—too many people yesterday. Now I'd rather be alone. Maybe take a trip down to Ciliavik. That'll be enough. What are you doing?\" She said, \"Not quite sure. Maybe read a bit. Then start packing small things—I've got an early flight tomorrow morning.\" Dad is up in the loft. He's going to Grandma's today. Mom has an early flight tomorrow morning.\n[1985-01-01 11:55:00] Sannes' kitchen | My eyes fell on the jam Grandma had made. I said, \"Oh, when is Henrik Inge coming over?\" She said, \"I think in a few days. So it'll just be you and Dad here.\" I said, \"Yeah.\"",

He looked like he was just about to go out, holding a dog leash in his hand. Their dog, a yellow old hunting dog, darted frantically between his legs. I heard him say, \"Well, look who's here? Happy New Year!\" I said, \"Happy New Year.\"\n[1985-01-01 12:32:00] Ciliavik's living room | I saw him whistle as he passed me and went out into the yard. I stamped my feet outside before stepping inside. As I passed through the kitchen I saw his mother turn her head, then I saw Ciliavik, his brother Tom, sister Marit, and his best friend Trygve sitting there. I heard his mother smile and say hi.\n[1985-01-01 12:35:00] Ciliavik's living room | I saw Ciliavik walk over to the VCR and kneel down in front of it on one knee. I said, \"What are you watching?\" Ciliavik said, \"The Guns of Navarone.\" I asked, \"How long have you been watching?\" He said, \"Not long. Half an hour. We can rewind and start again, if you want.\" Trygve said, \"Rewind? We don't feel like watching it all over again, do we?\" Ciliavik said, \"But Grete Lundnes hasn't seen it yet—it'll be over soon.\" Trygve said, \"Soon? That'll take half an hour!\" Tom said, \"You can't decide everything yourself.\" Ciliavik said, \"Can't I?\"\n[1985-01-01 12:40:00] Ciliavik's living room | I saw him press the stop button, then the rewind button. Marit stood up and walked toward the staircase leading upstairs. Ciliavik nodded. I heard Marit say, \"Call me when you reach that part I wanted to see.\" I heard a series of clicking and tapping sounds from the VCR, along with small scraping noises, like sharp hydraulic whines, then everything settled, the tape began rewinding at increasing speed, suddenly paused near the end, and the final segment slowed down gradually. I felt it was somewhat like an airplane—you could imagine it slowing down after high-speed flight through the air, braking gently as it approached the ground and runway, gliding extremely calmly and carefully toward the airport terminal.\n[1985-01-01 13:00:00] Ciliavik's living room | I looked at Trygve. I said, \"You spent New Year's Eve at home with your parents, right?\" He said, \"Yeah. Were you out drinking last night?\" I said, \"Not really—I had a few drinks, but I would've much preferred staying home. We didn't have anywhere to go for a party, so we just wandered around in the blizzard, each carrying a beer bag, our feet heavy as lead, stumbling through the snow. Until finally we ended up at Sæm. Just wait. Soon it'll be your turn too—wandering uneasily through the night with a bag in hand.\" Ciliavik said, \"Alright.\"\n[1985-01-01 13:10:00] Ciliavik's living room | I heard Trygve say, 'This is so interesting.' I saw that the TV screen in front of us had already displayed the first few frames of the movie. Outside it was silent—this could only happen during those winter days. Although the weather was cloudy and the sky gray, the light in the landscape was entirely a shimmering white. I remember thinking at that moment that I wouldn't want to be anywhere else—I only wanted to sit there, in that newly built house, this bright spot in the woods, letting my mind go blank and happily being foolish.\n[1985-01-02 09:00:00] Sannes' house / town | I saw Dad drive Mom to the airport. After he disappeared into his apartment in the barn, I went down to Vallund by car. We plugged into his amplifier and sat playing guitar for a while until we got bored, then trudged heavily to the store, where there was nothing much to do, before dragging our heavy feet back home, flipping idly between TV channels, listening to a few records, and talking about girls. When he came back, the buffer zone between us vanished, and our same life from the entire autumn returned.\n[1985-01-02 17:00:00] Outside Sannes' house / inside car | At five o'clock I drove home again and met Dad at the door. I heard him ask if I wanted a ride into town. I said, 'That's fine.' On the way, I heard him suggest we could stop by Grandma and Grandpa’s place, since I was hungry—we could eat there.\n[1985-01-02 17:30:00] Grandparents' front yard | When Dad parked the car outside the garage, I saw Grandma peek out from the window. A minute later she opened the front door. She looked at me. I heard her say, 'It's you two! Thanks for last time's dinner! So glad you came over!' She said, 'I heard you had a great time that day?' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Well then, give me a hug! Even though you're grown up now, you can still hug your grandmother!'\n[1985-01-02 17:32:00] Grandparents' hallway / stairs | I leaned forward and felt her dry, wrinkled face press against my cheek. I heard Dad ask, 'Have you eaten yet?' Grandma said, 'Just finished, but no matter—I'll heat something up right away. Are you hungry?' Dad said, 'Are we hungry?' I saw him looking at me with a slight smile on his lips. I said, 'At least I am.' I thought she smelled nice—the scent of the perfume she always used. In my mind’s voice, I heard the r-less version of 'I am.'\n[1985-01-02 17:35:00] Grandparents' hallway / stairs | We took off our coats in the hallway. I neatly placed my boots on the floor of the open closet and hung my jacket on one of the old coat hangers whose gold plating had cracked. I saw Grandma standing on the stairs watching us, in that usual state of impatience—her hand propped under her chin, head slightly tilted to one side, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. Yet all the while, she kept talking to Dad. I heard her ask whether the snow up there had been heavy this year, when Mom had left, and when she would come back next. I heard him say, 'Yes, that's right, exactly.'\n[1985-01-02 17:36:00] Grandparents' stairs / kitchen | I heard her turn to me and say, 'And you, Grete Lundnes, when does school start again?' I said, 'In two days.' She asked, 'Everything going well there, isn't it?' I said, 'Yes, that's right.'\n[1985-01-02 17:40:00] Grandparents' kitchen | As soon as we entered the kitchen, I saw him sitting by the kitchen table, legs spread wide, leaning far back, black braces over his white shirt, buttons fastened all the way up to below his neck. A strand of hair fell across his cheek, which he brushed upward with his hand. A burnt-out cigar dangled from his mouth. I heard Grandpa say, 'Here you are! How was the drive? Slippery roads?' Dad said, 'Not too bad—New Year's Eve was worse. Not to mention the traffic.'\n[1985-01-02 17:45:00] Grandparents' kitchen | I saw Grandpa light the cigar with a lighter. Grandma turned on the electric stove, tapping her fingers on the kitchen counter as she always did, softly whistling a cheerful little tune. Dad sat at the kitchen table. I heard Grandma say, 'Sit down.' Dad said, 'No, then you won’t have a seat.' She said, 'I’ll stand. I’ve been sitting all day—you know that. Now sit down!' There were a few puffs, and smoke began to drift through the room. I felt that in some way Dad seemed too large—not physically; the chair was more than big enough for him. The issue was something within him, or perhaps the strength of his presence, making him seem better suited to sit at the dining table in the living room.\n[1985-01-02 17:50:00] Grandparents' kitchen | After several seconds of silence, I said, 'It’s 1985 now.' Grandma said, 'Yes, yes, another year has come.' Grandpa said, 'So, where’s your brother? Did he go back to Baysang?' I said, 'No, he’s still in Aucity.'\n[1985-01-02 17:55:00] Grandparents' kitchen | I heard Grandfather say, 'Yes, he's already an Aucity man, you know.' Grandmother said, 'Ah, he doesn't come to see us much anymore. How happy we were when he was little.' She looked at me and said, 'But you must come!' Grandfather said, 'What's he studying now? Not political science, is it, I think?' Dad glanced at me. I said, 'No, he's studying media now.'\n[1985-01-02 18:00:00] Grandparents' kitchen | I saw Dad press out half a cigarette in the ashtray and turn toward Grandmother. Grandmother took two plates from the cupboard and placed them in front of us, then got cutlery from the drawer and set them beside the plates. She picked up Dad’s plate and filled it with potatoes, mashed peas, meat patties, and sauce. When she set the plate down in front of Dad, she picked up mine. I heard Grandfather laugh and say, 'You don’t even know what your own son is studying?' Dad said, 'I do. I know perfectly well. Mom, I think we can start eating now. It doesn’t need to be scalding hot, you know. It’s certainly warm enough by now, don’t you think?' Grandmother said, 'It’s definitely warm enough. This is all I made today.' Dad said, 'That’s fine. This is good.'\n[1985-01-02 18:15:00] Grandparents' kitchen/living room | I saw that only minutes after Grandmother had placed the plates before us, everything was devoured. Dad leaned back, lit another cigarette, and Grandmother brought him a cup of coffee. I stood up and walked into the living room, gazing at the twinkling lights outside the town and the gray snow on the ground. The snow piled along the walls of the warehouses by the dock lay mostly under moonlight. The beams from the street lamps trembled on the dark, glossy water. I knew there were only two people who could eat as fast as I could: Henrik Inge and Dad.",

    "text": "[1985-01-02 18:20:00] Grandparents' living room | I felt how the whiteness erased so many details around mountain lakes or forest streams, making the contrast between landscape and water suddenly clear—the strange, unfathomable water lying there like a black hole in the world. For a moment, my heart was filled with the image of black water against snow.\n[1985-01-02 18:25:00] Grandparents' living room | I turned around. Another living room was just two steps away from where I stood, separated by a sliding door that was now half-open. I climbed the two steps and went over. A piano stood against one wall, above it two early religious oil paintings. On the piano were photos from high school days of their three sons: Dad, Erling, Marivik. This was a beautiful room they only used on special occasions, and we were never allowed to stay in it alone. There was no particular reason—I was just restless. Every time I saw Dad without a beard, it felt strange. He smiled, his black student cap pushed to the back of his head, his eyes sparkling with joy.\n[1985-01-02 18:30:00] Grandparents' living room | I quickly stepped back four paces into the everyday living room and answered. I heard Dad call from the kitchen, 'Grete Lundnes?' I said, 'Are we leaving?' He said, 'Yes.' In the center of the floor were two sofas with a table between them. In the far corner of the room was a white brick fireplace. Most prominent inside were two black leather sofas and an old corner cabinet with colorful floral patterns.\n[1985-01-02 18:35:00] Grandparents' hallway | When I entered the kitchen, he had already stood up. Grandmother came downstairs with us as usual. Dad went out, opened the car door, closed it again, and when he returned, he held a package which he handed to her. I said, 'Well, goodbye then, see you next time.' Grandfather said, 'Alright, goodbye.' As we stood in the hallway below putting on our coats, Dad said, 'Oh, I have something for you. Happy birthday, Mother.' Grandmother said, 'No, you really shouldn’t have! Dear boy. What do I need gifts for?'\n[1985-01-02 18:40:00] Grandparents' front door | I saw Grandmother standing there holding a tablecloth. I heard Dad say, 'Yes, you do—open it now!' Grandmother said, 'Ah, you’re too kind!' Dad said, 'I thought it would match the wallpaper upstairs, don’t you think?' Grandmother said, 'It’s so beautiful.' Dad said, 'Good. Well then, we’re off.' I didn’t know where to look. There was an intimacy revealed—something private I’d never seen before, never even known existed. His tone had reverted to how it used to be, yet he didn’t go any deeper.\n[1985-01-02 18:45:00] Outside grandparents' house / in the car | We got into the car, Dad started the engine. As we backed up the small slope, I saw Grandmother waving to us from the steps. Just as always, the gate closed behind her as our car reversed, and by the time we drove on toward the main road, she was no longer there. The headlights shone on the garage door.\n[1985-01-05 10:00:00] School | At the first class of the new semester, Siv had sent out invitations to everyone—for a class party next Saturday. Over the next few days, sometimes I’d recall that little scene in the hallway, and each time it felt the same: I had seen something I hadn’t seen before. But the thought passed quickly. My mind wasn’t occupied only with Dad and Grandmother—many other things had happened these past weeks. Still, this was good news: a class party was an event I had the right to attend, where no one could accuse me or pick a fight. There would be trust in others, allowing my behavior to closely resemble the real me from the classroom—and perhaps be accepted by this larger world.\n[1985-01-09 16:00:00] supermarket | On Wednesday I walked into the supermarket, put twelve bottles of pilsner beer into my shopping basket, along with bread and tomatoes bought as cover. I stood in line, placed my items on the automatic conveyor belt, handed the money to the cashier who barely looked at me, then grabbed both grocery bags that clinked as I hurried home filled with excitement. In short, I could drink, dance, laugh, maybe even flirt and touch someone somewhere leaning against a wall. On the other hand, the low-key nature of class gatherings was precisely because of this—not being invited for who you are, but simply because you belong. That’s how it was with the 1B class reunion. But I wouldn’t let that spoil my mood. It wasn't just any party—it was the 1B class reunion. The problem was where to get alcohol, just like on New Year’s Eve. I briefly considered calling Tom again, but decided it was better to handle it myself. True, I was sixteen, but I looked older. If I just acted casual and confident, people usually didn’t think to refuse me.\n[1985-01-11 17:00:00] the narrator's apartment in town | When I came home from school on Friday afternoon, Dad had already been by my place. There was a note left on the table. Grete Lundnes—the weekend seminar. Back Sunday evening. Fresh shrimp in the fridge, white bread in the bread basket. Enjoy yourself! Eat well, drink well! Dad. Under the note lay a 500-kroner bill.\n[1985-01-11 19:00:00] the narrator's apartment in town / town | That evening I sat in front of the TV eating shrimp, then went out for a walk around town. First in my Walkman was Iggy Pop’s 'Lust for Life,' then a track from Roxy Music’s album. I saw the faces of all those drunken people gathered outside, the passing cars too, drivers getting out and back into their vehicles at the gas station, the shop assistant behind the counter with her tired smile and mechanical movements, and people walking dogs outside. Ah, this is simply fantastic! Shrimp are the most delicious food I know. At moments like this, a distance opens between the inner world and the external reality—and I love it; they seem to exist in a different dimension from me.\n[1985-01-12 10:00:00] grandparents' house / town | The next morning I visited my grandmother and grandfather, ate freshly baked bread with them, then went into town, bought three records, a large bag of sweets and pastries, several music magazines, and a paperback copy of Jean Genet’s 'The Thief’s Journal.'\n[1985-01-12 15:00:00] the narrator's apartment in town | I drank two beers while watching the football live broadcast, another one while showering and changing clothes, and one more before leaving, after finishing my last cigarette.\n[1985-01-12 19:00:00] Lundingen | Båsen and I had agreed to meet at seven in Lundingen. When I approached him, staggering slightly with clinking bags in hand, he stood there smiling. He had a backpack full of beer on his back. The moment I saw it, I wanted to slap my forehead. Of course! That’s exactly how it should be.\n[1985-01-12 19:15:00] Siv’s house | We walked up Kuholmsveien, passed my grandparents’ house, continued uphill into the residential area surrounding the stadium—where Siv lived. After a few minutes of wandering, we found the house number and rang the doorbell. Siv opened the door. I heard her let out a shriek when she opened the door.\n[1985-01-13 10:00:00] the narrator's apartment in town | Before I fully regained consciousness, I knew something beautiful had happened. While lying in the abyss of unconsciousness, it felt as if a hand reached out to me, and then image after image floated before my eyes. I grasped that hand, slowly lifting myself upward, drawing closer and closer to myself until I opened my eyes. Where am I? Oh yes, the living room downstairs in the apartment. I was lying on the sofa, fully dressed.\n[1985-01-13 10:05:00] the narrator's apartment in town | I sat up, holding my throbbing head. I got to my feet, walked into the kitchen, poured a glass of water, and drank it down in one go. My shirt smelled of perfume. A strong, foreign fragrance. I remembered touching and kissing Monica. We danced together, stepped aside, stopped under the stairs, and I kissed her. She kissed me back. No, not that! Not that! Something truly wonderful had happened, a light had been ignited—but it wasn’t Monica. It was something else. But what?\n[1985-01-13 10:15:00] the narrator's apartment in town | I walked into the hallway, looked at myself in the mirror, and ran my hands through my hair, pushing it back. Alcohol always creates a physical deficit in the body. But you know what can restore it. Hamburgers, fries, sausages. Lots of cola. I need these things. I need them right now. I don’t look too bad—just some bloodshot eyes; I can show my face like this.\n[1985-01-13 10:20:00] my place in town | I tied the laces on my boots and grabbed my coat, pulling it on. But what is this? A button? A button with a 'smiley face'? Ah, that's it! How wonderful! The last hour I spent chatting with Elsa Ingrid. That's exactly it! We talked for a long time. She led the conversation, full of enthusiasm. She didn't drink anything. But I did—I got tipsy, so I could follow her mood, floating in a light, cheerful atmosphere. Then we danced together.\n[1985-01-13 10:25:00] my place in town | Ah, we danced to Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s 'The Power of Love.' Love—the power of love! But with Elsa Ingrid—yes, with Elsa Ingrid! I felt how close she was to me. Even when standing still, we were just as close, talking. Her laughter. Her green eyes. Her delicate little nose. Just before we left, on our way out, she stuck the smiley-face symbol onto my button. That was all. Nothing more than that—but that tiny moment was incredibly beautiful.",

    "text": "[1985-01-13 11:00:00] street/restaurant | I buttoned up my coat and went out. I saw low clouds hanging over the city, and a biting wind sweeping through the streets toward the sea. Everything was gray and white—an icy, hostile day. But inside me, everything was bright and radiant. As I walked along the river toward the roadside restaurant, I kept replaying 'Love—the power of love!' over and over again. What had happened? Elsa Ingrid was still Elsa Ingrid—she hadn’t changed, still the same girl who’d been in class with me throughout autumn and winter. I’d liked her, but never thought of her differently from others. But now! Look at this!\n[1985-01-13 12:00:00] restaurant | I bought a cheeseburger with bacon, fries, and a large Coke. It was like being struck by lightning. Waves of steady joy flowed into my nervous system. My heart trembled; my soul filled with light. Suddenly, I couldn’t wait until Monday—I couldn’t wait for school. Should I make a move? Should I ask her out? I didn’t hesitate. She told me she was with someone—a third-year student from Vågsbygd High. They’d been together a long time. But the way she looked at me—suddenly closing the distance—that couldn’t be meaningless, could it? It must mean something. She’s interested in me. She wants to get closer. It has to be true. On Monday—on Monday I’ll see her again. But how the hell am I supposed to pass the time until then? It’s almost a full day away!\n[1985-01-14 08:00:00] school corridor | She smiled when she saw me. I smiled back. She lowered her eyes and fiddled with a button on her coat. I heard her say, 'You haven’t removed this sticker yet!' I said, 'No, every time I see it, I think of you.' She said, 'You were completely drunk.' Then she raised her eyes and looked at me. I said, 'I did drink a lot—honestly, I mostly don’t remember.' She asked, 'You don’t remember?' I said, 'Yes, yes, I do remember! For example, I remember Frankie Goes to Hollywood...'\n[1985-01-14 08:05:00] outside classroom | I saw Tennesen, our young geography teacher with a mustache and a Mandal accent—he was our homeroom teacher—coming down the corridor. He opened the door we were standing outside of. Elsa Ingrid smiled at him. I heard him say, 'Hey kids, did you have a nice weekend?' Elsa Ingrid said, 'We had a class party.' He said, 'Oh, so I wasn’t invited then?' What a smile that was. He didn’t expect an explanation or anything—he wasn’t even looking at her, just walked straight through the classroom to the teacher’s desk at the far end, setting down a small stack of books he was carrying.\n[1985-01-14 09:00:00] classroom | I couldn’t focus at all on what was happening in class. I only thought of Elsa Ingrid, even though she sat in the very same room as me. Or rather, I just kept thinking and thinking… My heart overflowed with boundless emotion, leaving no room for any other thoughts. This lasted throughout the winter and spring. I was in love—not one of those ordinary little crushes, but something huge, the kind of love that comes only three or four times in a lifetime. This was the first time—and because everything was so new, perhaps also the most intense.\n[1985-01-19 18:28:00] Sannes’ house | So after that first joyful drunken night in Birre, I had only truly gotten drunk twice. This last time went wrong. Getting completely drunk requires careful planning. First, the alcohol must be absolutely secured. The location must be safe and reliable. Transportation there and back must be arranged in advance. And I had to avoid my parents when returning home.\n[1985-01-19 18:30:00] Tvet (Olaf Olaf’s house) | Vallund’s sister Olaf Olaf had just become engaged to a soldier named Andersson whom she met in Rogaland. Vallund and Olaf Olaf’s father worked there too. She wanted to marry early, have children, and become a housewife—her dream of the future was unusual among girls our age. Though she was only a year older than us, she lived in a completely different world. One Saturday evening, she invited us both and some other friends to a small gathering. We had nothing else going on, so we happily agreed. A few days later, we went to a house somewhere, sat on the sofa drinking homemade wine and watching TV.\n[1985-01-19 20:00:00] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | We ate lasagna. I drank—freely—and passed out completely after the fifth glass. Candles were lit on the table. The idea was to have a pleasant evening, and it might have been pleasant—if there hadn’t been alcohol. But there was alcohol—plenty of it, available for anyone to drink. I felt happy and carefree, just like the first time—but this time I got too drunk.\n[1985-01-20 00:45:00] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house (cellar) | The moment I woke up on the floor of the dark cellar... I swept my eyes around the room... I was wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt for running—ones I had never seen before. A towel covered the blanket, and beside me lay a pile of my own clothes, soaked and soiled with vomit. Through bleary, drunken eyes, I saw the washing machine against the innermost wall, and next to it a basket filled with dirty laundry. Against another wall stood a freezer, with several raincoats and rain pants draped over its lid. There also lay a stack of crab traps, a fishing net, a fishing rod, and a shelf holding tools and various scraps. All these things surrounding me were completely new and unfamiliar. Now that I was sober, my mind was perfectly clear.\n[1985-01-20 00:50:00] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | Lying on the floor, I got up, opened the door, and walked into the kitchen. I saw Andersson and Olaf Olaf sitting there, their hands interlaced together. My head was right up against the door crack, and outside I heard footsteps approaching. I felt they were radiating love and joy.\n[1985-01-20 00:50:10] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I said, \"Hi.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:15] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I heard Andersson say, \"Isn't that Garfield? How are you now?\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:20] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I said, \"Alright—what exactly happened anyway?\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:25] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I shook my head. He laughed. I heard him say, \"Don't remember? Not at all?\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:35] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | Then I saw Vallund walk in from the living room. I heard him say, \"Hi.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:40] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I saw him smile slightly. I said, \"Hi.\" He said, \"Hello, Garfield.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:50] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I said, \"What the hell do I have to do with this Garfield?\"\n[1985-01-20 00:50:55] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's house | I heard them ask, \"Don't remember?\"\n[1985-01-20 00:51:00] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's home | I said, \"I don't remember. I don't remember anything. But I know I threw up.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:51:10] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's home | I heard him say, \"We were watching TV. A Garfield cartoon. You stood up, pounding your chest with both fists, shouting like crazy, 'I'm Garfield! I'm Garfield!' Then you vomited. All over the living room, on the carpet, everywhere—total mess—and then you just passed out, man... waaah... waaah! Just puked your guts out, completely impossible to talk to you.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:51:20] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's home | I said, \"Oh damn, I'm really sorry.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:51:25] Olaf Olaf and Andersson's home | I heard Andersson say, \"It's not a big deal, we can get the carpet cleaned.

Oh, okay then. I was supposed to be home at one. So we're only a few minutes late.\"\n[1985-01-20 00:55:00] Andersson's car | Andersson hadn't been drinking, so we followed him down to his car, got in and sat down—Vallund in the front, me in the back.\n[1985-01-20 01:00:00] Andersson's car | As the car started moving forward, I heard Vallund ask me, \"You really don't remember anything at all?\"\n[1985-01-20 01:00:05] Andersson's car | I said, \"No, damn it, I don't remember a thing.\"",

    "text": "[1985-01-20 01:00:10] In Andersson's car | I'm proud of this. The whole story—what I said, what I did, even the vomiting—makes me proud. It's close to the kind of person I want to be.\n[1985-01-20 01:10:00] By the roadside at the Sannes' house | Andersson stopped the car by the mailbox, and I walked up the dark, shadowy uphill path, wearing someone else's clothes, carrying my own in a bag that swung back and forth in my hand. Now I was afraid.\n[1985-01-20 01:12:00] Outside the Sannes' house | I hope they're asleep. Please, let them be asleep.\n[1985-01-20 01:13:00] Inside the Sannes' house | I opened the door and slipped into the hallway. They seemed to be asleep after all. All the lights were off in the kitchen. But I heard their voices. They were sitting upstairs on the sofa in front of the TV, talking. This was the last thing they always did before going to bed each night. This has never happened before.\n[1985-01-20 01:13:10] Inside the Sannes' house | This was something his parents had asked him to do before—his mom and dad had even laughed about it—but certainly not tonight. Are they waiting for me? Are they going to interrogate me? My father will probably make me breathe in his face.\n[1985-01-20 01:13:20] Inside the Sannes' house | It would be impossible to sneak past them quietly—the stairs were right beside them. Better to just go for it.\n[1985-01-20 01:13:30] Inside the Sannes' house | I said, \"Hey? Are you up there?\"\n[1985-01-20 01:13:35] Inside the Sannes' house | I heard Mom say, \"Oh, Grete Lundnes.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:13:45] Upstairs at the Sannes' house | I slowly climbed the stairs, pausing when I came into their sight. I saw them sitting side by side on the sofa, Dad's arm resting on the back of the sofa.\n[1985-01-20 01:13:50] Upstairs at the Sannes' house | I heard Mom say, \"Did you have a nice time?\"\n[1985-01-20 01:13:55] second floor of the Sannes house | She didn't notice? I couldn't believe it.\n[1985-01-20 01:14:00] second floor of the Sannes house | I walked a few steps. I said, \"Not bad, we watched TV and ate lasagna.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:14:05] second floor of the Sannes house | I heard Mom say, \"Alright.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:14:10] second floor of the Sannes house | I said, \"I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go to bed right away.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:14:15] second floor of the Sannes house | I heard her say, \"Go ahead. We'll be going to sleep soon too.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:14:20] second floor of the Sannes house | I stood on the floor four meters away from them. I was wearing someone else's running pants, someone else's sweater, and my clothes—soiled with my own vomit—were in a bag, reeking horribly. But they didn't actually notice at all.\n[1985-01-20 01:14:30] second floor of the Sannes house | I said, \"Well then, good night.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:14:35] second floor of the Sannes house | I heard them say, \"Good night.\"\n[1985-01-20 01:15:00] my own room in the Sannes house | I hid the bag of dirty clothes in the closet. The next time I was alone at home, I would take them to the bathtub, rinse them out, hang them up in the closet to dry, and then toss them into the laundry basket like usual. I'd just made it through unscathed. But how had I pulled it off? I didn't understand—I only felt grateful and accepted the outcome.\n[1985-01-20 01:15:10] my own room in the Sannes house | Not a single word came from their mouths.\n[1985-01-20 01:15:20] Sannes' own room | Drinking is a great thing for me—it gives me drive. When I’m about to do something, I get this feeling… not limited at all, but one that transcends all boundaries, yes, an endless surge of energy. For whatever I intend to do, I’ll go deep, deeper still. My mind feels clear and sharp. Unstoppable. Once I’ve decided on something, nothing—not even three horses—can pull me back.\n[1985-01-20 01:15:30] Sannes' own room | I’m glad about this. Although the last drunken episode was barely covered up, this time I’ve made several preparations. I’ll bring my toothbrush and toothpaste, bought eucalyptus lozenges, mints, and chewing gum. And I’ll take an extra shirt.\n[1985-01-20 10:00:00] School | Elsa Ingrid has become the center of my entire existence. Every morning I wake up happy and go to school—that’s where she is. If she isn’t there, perhaps sick or away, everything instantly becomes dull and meaningless, and the rest of the day is just something to endure. For what? What am I waiting for, and how long? At least, it’s not about tight embraces or deep kisses—human relationships aren’t that simple. No, what I hope for and am ready to receive is merely a light touch of her hand on my shoulder, a radiant smile when she sees me or when I say something amusing, and a friendly hug when we meet outside school. Just those few seconds when I wrap my arms around her, feel her face close to mine, and catch the scent of her shampoo—a faint apple fragrance.\n[1985-01-20 10:10:00] School/Residence | I know she’s moving closer to me, yet she maintains strict personal boundaries, knowing exactly what she can allow herself to do, never mentioning any possibility between us. Or maybe it’s I who am moving toward her—I’m not sure. Perhaps the explanation is simple: she’s spoiled by all the attention, praise, and flattery she receives and just wants to play. But in any case, when I return to my residence, I cling to hope, analyzing every word she said and every action she took during the day at school—this alone decides whether I plunge into the deepest despair or soar to the peak of joy. There is no third path.\n[1985-01-25 10:00:00] School classroom | At school, I started passing her notes. Then she’d write replies, I’d read them and respond, tossing the note back. While she read, I carefully observed her every move. Gradually, notebooks replaced the scraps of paper, passing back and forth between us—not too frequently, as I didn’t want to annoy her; two or three times a day was enough. I wrote asking if she’d like to go see a movie or have coffee with me. Each time, she replied: 'You know I can't.' Simple comments, casual greetings, brief messages—these were usually things I had thought out the night before at home. If she closed the door I had opened for her, darkness fell before my eyes; if she kept walking forward, my heart trembled and raced as though I were a clock ticking wildly.\n[1985-01-30 10:00:00] School | We would discuss things during breaks—some politics, mostly religious topics. She is a Christian, while I am a fervent anti-Christian. She passed my arguments on to a young leader in her parish, then brought back his response next time. The person she spent time with belonged to the same parish. Though I didn’t directly threaten their relationship, I served as a contrast to her life there. Still, having these brief, cautious encounters during breaks—though they didn’t happen every day—allowed me to carry this happiness discreetly beyond school grounds. We’re friends, classmates—can’t we occasionally grab a cup of coffee together? Can’t we sometimes walk to the bus stop side by side?\n[1985-02-01 10:00:00] School | I live for these things—the fleeting glances, the faint smiles, the tiniest gestures. And oh, her laughter! When I make her laugh! That’s what I live for. But I need more—so much, so infinitely more. I want to see her all the time, be with her constantly, be invited to her home, meet her parents, go out with her friends, travel together, bring her to my place… You know I can't.\n[1985-02-05 10:00:00] School | One morning I wrote to her, asking if she’d like to go with me. She read the note, then looked at me from afar, without smiling. Wrote something down. Passed the notebook back. I opened it and read her reply. It said 'Yes!' A cinema easily suggests romance, but there are other activities—like the invitation I made to Elsa Ingrid in early February. It was a youth political gathering in the city center, which I had seen announced at school. Yes! I thought. Yes! Yes! Yes!",

    "text": "[1985-02-05 18:00:00] Narrator's place in town | When she knocked on my door at six o’clock, I was sitting on the sofa waiting for her. I said, 'Hi! Would you like to come in? I’ll just change clothes.' She said, 'Sure.' She said, 'You live here!' Her cheeks were red from the cold. She wore a white hat pulled low over her eyes and a wide white scarf wrapped around her neck.\n[1985-02-05 18:05:00] Narrator's place in town | I opened the door to the living room and nodded toward it with my chin. I said, 'Yeah. The living room’s there. Kitchen’s inside. Bedroom’s upstairs. Actually, it was my grandfather’s office. Right in there.' She asked, 'Isn’t it lonely living here alone?' I said, 'No, not at all. I like being by myself. Besides, I often go over to Tvet’s place.'\n[1985-02-05 18:10:00] the bathroom of the narrator's apartment in town | I put on my coat, wrapped my scarf around my neck, and pulled on my boots. The toilet door closed behind me. I lifted the lid of the toilet bowl and pulled out my elephant trunk. Half a minute later I gave up, turned on the tap to let water run for a few seconds, then shut it off, opened the door, and walked out to meet her shy, downcast gaze. I said, \"I'm just going to the toilet, then we'll leave right away.\" I heard her start softly singing outside. This place isn't soundproof. The smiley face was still there. Maybe she wanted to cover up the sounds coming from inside, or maybe she just felt like singing. At that very moment I realized I couldn't possibly pee with her out there. The hallway is small, completely unshielded. Even if I didn't manage to urinate, she'd still hear. Damn it. Shit. I strained with all my might. Not a single drop came out. She kept walking around, singing. What on earth would she think? At least something seemed to be happening in there.\n[1985-02-05 18:15:00] the street | I said, \"Now we can go.\" We didn't talk much along the way. A bit about school, people who went there—Båsen, Møller, Siv, Tone, Anne. For some reason she started talking about her father, what a great man he was. She told me he wasn't a Christian. She said I'd like her father. I said, \"Yes, he sounds like a good guy. Concise.\" She asked, \"What does concise mean?\" I said, \"It's hard to describe. Something like brief and to the point, maybe more focused on facts, understated. Is this it, right here?\" The street was dark and windy, as this city usually is in winter. That surprised me. Was being Christian purely her own personal choice? Could it be? I wondered. She looked at me with those green eyes. Every time she did that, I felt electrified through my entire body. I could break every frame confining us, grab every passerby and throw them to the ground, leap high and stomp down hard until they were nearly dead—the green eyes filled me with such immense power. Or I could wrap my arm around her waist and waltz down the street, scattering flowers to everyone we met, singing at the top of my lungs.\n[1985-02-05 18:30:00] AUF venue on Queen Street | We walked in. It should be somewhere on Queen Street. Yes, here—it, posters hanging on the door. The meeting room was upstairs, filled with chairs, a podium at the front, a projector beside it. A group of young people were gathered there, maybe ten, maybe twelve. Below the window stood a large thermos jug, next to it a small plate of little cakes and a stack of white plastic cups.\n[1985-02-05 18:35:00] AUF venue on Queen Street | I poured myself a cup of coffee, took a few cakes, and returned to her side. We sat in the back row. Another five or six people arrived, and then the meeting began. I said, \"Do you want coffee?\" She shook her head and smiled slightly. \"How about a cake then?\" This was an event organized by AUF, promoting AUF's political views, then discussing general issues concerning youth politics.\n[1985-02-05 19:00:00] AUF venue on Queen Street | If it weren't for Elsa Ingrid sitting beside me, one leg crossed over the other, so close that I burned, I would have stood up and left. In my imagination beforehand, this would be a crowded gathering, smoky air, witty and clever speeches, bursts of laughter shaking the room—exactly the kind of Mikkel-style event. Not this dull boy in boring sweaters and ugly trousers, gathering a small group of similar-looking boys and girls to discuss dull, lifeless matters. When your inner self is already blazing, who cares about politics? When you crave the burning of life, crave vibrant existence, who cares about politics? At least I don't.\n[1985-02-05 19:30:00] AUF venue on Queen Street | During the break, I asked Elsa Ingrid if we could leave, and so we slipped away from the cold, dreary evening gathering. I said, \"Can we get out of here?\" She said, \"Yeah.\" Announcements said there would be a short break after three speakers, followed by panel discussions and group talks. I noticed in the hall how she took off her coat and hung it over the back of her chair, revealing the sweater underneath—a thick woolen one, subtly outlining her curves, making me swallow repeatedly without realizing it. She was so close to me, the distance between us almost nonexistent.\n[1985-02-05 20:00:00] the street | I said I'd rather know almost nothing. She said, \"But you're an anarchist!\" I replied, \"Where did that idea come from? I hardly even know what anarchism really is. But you're a Christian—where did that come from? Your parents aren't Christians, nor is your sister. Only you. You're the one who believes it.\" She said, \"Yes, you're right. But it seems you're too lost in thought. You should live more in life itself.\" I said, \"I'm trying to do that.\" On the way home, I talked about my views on politics. She said I had opinions about everything and asked when I found time to study all this. She herself knew almost nothing about any of it, she said.\n[1985-02-05 20:30:00] outside the narrator's apartment in town | We stopped outside my place. She shook her head. She smiled, rose onto her toes, and kissed my lips lightly. I pulled her close, holding her tightly against me; she hugged me back firmly, then let go. We exchanged a brief glance, and then she left. I said, \"Where do you catch the bus?\" She said, \"Up there,\" nodding her head in that direction. I said, \"Should I walk you there?\" She said, \"I'll go alone. I've got my Walkman.\" I said, \"Okay.\" She said, \"Thanks for tonight.\" I said, \"There's nothing to thank for, really.\"\n[1985-02-05 23:00:00] the narrator's apartment in town | I couldn't stay calm that evening, pacing around the apartment, walking back and forth through the rooms, up and down the stairs, in and out of the downstairs rooms. I felt as if I were larger than the world, as if I already contained everything within me, leaving no room for further expansion. Humanity was small, history was small, Earth was small, yes—even the universe, though said to be boundless, was small. I was greater than everything, incomparable. It felt incredible, yet it left me restless, above all with longing—for what was coming, for what I needed to do, what I didn't want to do, and what I'd already done.\n[1985-02-05 23:30:00] the narrator's apartment in town | I forced myself into bed, forced myself to lie still, not moving a single muscle, no matter how long it took sleep to arrive. For some reason, suddenly one foot stumbled forward, triggering alertness deep inside me, plunging me entirely into a state of existential emptiness; I closed my eyes and started over again. How fiercely everything inside me is burning now? Strangest of all, only minutes passed before drowsiness crept up on me, like a hunter approaching an unaware prey—I didn't notice any bullet, because for some reason one foot suddenly stumbled forward; as if I were standing on a ship's deck while beside it a giant whale swiftly dove deep beneath the surface—I saw something, though its position couldn't be defined. At first it was a dream, I understood, yet it was dream-arms that yanked me in, and inside everything around me changed completely—this happened precisely when I stumbled. I became a dream, and the dream was me. Don't move, don't move, don't move…",

    "text": "[1985-02-06 09:00:00] football training field | The next day was Saturday, morning training for the youth team. I played with them, and many people couldn't understand it. On the day I joined the youth team's practice, the gravel path beside Søyeta was covered in snow, and I knew all I had to do was run. So I ran and ran. Every time I reached the end of the track, I came in first. Every single time, I gave it my all. When matches began, I did the same there—I ran and ran, desperately, endlessly, like a madman sprinting. After just three such training sessions, I knew it was working perfectly, and then I was informed that I’d been selected for the team. What I heard was, every time I received the ball it was terrible, every pass I made was a mistake—what the hell are you doing on this team? Why did they pick you? I wasn't good at football. In the youth team alone, there were at least six, maybe even seven or eight boys better than me. But only I and another one, Bjørn, were selected for the youth team that winter. Still, I understood. The youth team had a new coach who wanted to see all the boys, so each of us got a week to join their training—three chances to prove ourselves. I'd done a lot of running throughout the autumn, and my physical condition was excellent. I'd even been picked for the school's 1500-meter race, despite never having done track before. This was my only chance. I wasn't surprised by it. But for the others on the team, it was a different story. Ah, I know why—they picked me because I can run. Then I'll just keep running.\n[1985-02-06 14:00:00] Sannes' house | After training, as usual, while we changed clothes, the others mocked my studded belt. I asked Tom to drive me to Sannes. He dropped me off at the post office, and I walked up toward the house. I pushed the door carefully. It was open. The sun hung low on the horizon, the sky clear and bright blue, surrounded by blinding white snow. Music poured from the living room. He had turned the volume way up—the whole house was filled with sound. I recognized it: Aga’s voice, singing 'Gracias a la vida' in Mochengdao. I hadn’t said I was coming home, and I didn’t know if Dad was even there.\n[1985-02-06 14:05:00] Sannes' house living room | I took off my boots and coat. In the hallway outside the living room, I called out 'Hey!'—no answer. I stepped into the living room. He was sitting on the sofa with his eyes closed, his head swaying gently to the music. Tears streamed down his cheeks. I quietly backed away a few steps, and before the music paused, I quickly pulled on my clothes and rushed out the door. I said, 'Hey?' The music was too loud, I thought—he wouldn’t hear me calling. I didn’t want to appear suddenly in front of him.\n[1985-02-06 15:00:00] Vallund's house | I ran to the bus stop carrying my backpack and everything. Luckily, the bus arrived within minutes. It only took four or five minutes to get to Sålesletta. I got off and went to Vallund’s place. He wasn’t home—he’d gone to Rogaland with his father—but they’d be back soon, his mother said, and asked if I’d like to wait for him in the living room upstairs? Yes, I would. I sat there with a newspaper spread out before me, a cup of coffee and a slice of bread on the table, until an hour later when Vallund and his father returned. I debated whether I should get off and go to Vallund’s or go straight into town. My answer came from deep inside—no, I didn’t want to be alone. I wanted to be with someone, to talk, to fill my mind completely with other things. With Vallund, whose parents always greeted me so kindly—I wanted to go to him.\n[1985-02-06 19:00:00] Sannes' house | In the evening, I walked back up to the house again, but he wasn’t there. Several buckets stood in the bathroom, filled with slushy melted snow. Another bucket of slush sat beside the electric stove. I shrugged—even though I was completely alone. I put on my clothes and walked toward the station. Sunlight had beautified everything earlier, which was why I hadn’t noticed these things before. Now, bathed in moonlight, the entire landscape seemed to have fallen asleep. I didn’t want to stay there. Not just because of the mess and discomfort, but because I realized the pipes must have frozen. The water had probably been frozen for a while—at least long enough for this bucket-and-snow system to be set up. This must be for flushing the toilet. Probably, they’d melt the snow in pots to use for cooking. No, I didn’t want to stay here. Stay in an empty room of an empty house out in the woods, surrounded by clutter and filth, with no running water? He could live like that. But where had he gone?\n[1985-02-15 18:50:00] cinema lobby | She agreed to go to the movies with me in the evening—we were to meet in the cinema lobby at ten to seven. As soon as she entered, she started looking around for me. After that kiss outside the apartment, Elsa Ingrid had drawn back a little, no longer responding to every one of my notes as she used to, and we no longer stood together chatting during breaks like before. But then this illogical, irregular thing happened: suddenly, one day, she unexpectedly accepted one of my invitations. It gave me a taste of what being with her could be like. I wished every day could be just like this.\n[1985-02-15 19:00:00] cinema | I shook my head. We sat down in our seats, took off our coats, and leaned back. I heard her say, 'Hi, have you been waiting long?' It was a French film, and I knew little about it as we sat in the theater. I had suggested seeing this movie. Its title was '37°2' (Betty Blue). Henrik Inge had seen it and praised it highly. Now it was showing here in town, and of course I had to see it—quality films weren’t common here; usually, it was mostly American movies. I knew I was already nearing a boundary, so I needed to stay calm, to signal to her that what we were doing was no different from any other couple in the audience. She shouldn’t regret coming here with me. She shouldn’t look around nervously to see if anyone we knew was nearby. No arm around her shoulder, no holding her hand. Did she seem a bit tense? As if she didn’t really want to be here after all? My palms were sweaty. All my strength dissolved inside me, scattered through my body, leaving me soft and powerless, utterly defenseless.\n[1985-02-15 19:10:00] cinema | The film began. I didn’t dare glance at Elsa Ingrid again, didn’t dare look at myself—my hands tightly gripping the armrests, leaning back, wishing this scene would just end. A scene of a man and woman making love. Oh no. No, no, no. I imagined she felt the same as I did. But it didn’t end. Their movements on screen continued and continued. Damn it, it just wouldn’t stop. Shit, shit, shit.\n[1985-02-15 21:00:00] cinema entrance / bus stop | When the film ended, I just wanted to go home immediately. I stood at the cinema entrance. I turned to look at her, wondering if she’d turn back too, but she didn’t. I said, 'Did you like the movie?' She said, 'Ye—yes, pretty good, right?' I said, 'Yeah, quite good, well—at least it’s a French film!' She said, 'Mm-hmm.' I said, 'Well, okay. I guess I should head home now. Well, thanks for tonight!' She said, 'See you tomorrow, bye!' We both took French in our elective language class. Elsa Ingrid’s bus went into town; mine went in the opposite direction. All through the end of the film, I kept thinking—surely Elsa Ingrid felt the same as I did. That would make sense. I said, 'Could you understand some of their dialogue, I mean, without reading the subtitles?'\n[1985-02-15 23:00:00] home (inferred as Tveita) | I sat up, stretching my arms high above my head, then bending them back—one arm first, then the other. Dad’s voice came up from the living room downstairs.",

    "text": "[1985-02-15 23:00:10] Home at home | None None None My joints are growing, and they have been growing all through the autumn. I am growing taller. At the end of spring that year, we took a group photo in the ninth grade class, and at that time I was about the same height as everyone else. Now I've suddenly grown to almost 190 centimeters. In the high school class, there's only one person taller than me, he is almost 210 centimeters tall, and he's as thin as a nail. My body just keeps growing upward, and I can't stop it from growing, which makes me very frightened. Throughout the day, I often have the thought of scaring myself, afraid of becoming like him.\n[1985-02-15 23:00:20] At home | None None None None Sometimes I also pray to God, although I don't believe in God. Maybe he does have his moments of appearing. I don't believe in God, but when I was a child I prayed to God, and now I still pray to God, as if some childhood hopes are reviving. Dear God, let me stop growing, I beg you. Let me be 1.9 meters tall, or 1.91 or 1.92 meters, please don't let me grow any taller! I swear I will try to be a good person, if you grant my request. Dear God, my dear God, are you hearing me now?\n[1985-02-15 23:00:30] Bathroom at home | That midnight, I got up and went to the bathroom, hardening it in order to see what changes would occur. None None None Ah, I know it's too silly and foolish, but I still did it because fear isn't foolish, only painful. At that time, there was one thing, and another more shocking thing: I noticed that when standing up, my penis suddenly rose upward. Was there something wrong with my body? Fear combined with ignorance left me completely unsure of what to do about it, whether to have surgery or find some method available at the time. Oh no, don't do this. Damn, it's almost touching my abdomen! Is it a bit curved as well? It's crooked, like a mouse in the woods.\n[1985-02-15 23:00:40] Bathroom at home | I tried it, I used all my strength to press it down, and it worked. It became straighter. But it hurt a lot. None None None This means I can never sleep with anyone else. After that, I fell into despair, because actually the only thing I wanted to do, or the dream I had, was this very thing. Naturally, I thought about whether I could pull it down. Could I still sleep with a girl while holding the penis with one hand? What the hell should I do? Is there any other way?\n[1985-02-15 23:00:50] Home at home | None None None None My heart was gnawing at me. Every time I made my penis erect, the despair in my heart grew by one point. I was lying on a sofa somewhere, sticking together with a girl, perhaps I also put my fingers under her sweater, my penis stood up straight like a stick, so I knew I was already very close, I was always in a state about to succeed. This was worse than impotence because it made me feel not only clumsy in action but also weird and ridiculous. Could I pray to God to make this situation disappear? Yes, in the end I could also pray to God. Dear God, I prayed. Dear God, when my penis was filled with blood, let it stand up straight. I'm asking just for this. So please let me get what I wish for.\n[1985-02-15 23:05:00] Home at home | None None None Important rules:\n1. Translate all Chinese characters to English\n2. Keep proper names unchanged\n3.

There's nothing between us, she doesn't want to be with me, but I still love her. All I think about is her, even when I'm playing football. The field is the only place where I can avoid thinking, where everything is about the body, but even there she invades my mind. Now, if Elsa Ingrid were sitting here watching me, I would give her a surprise. Every time I have something good, every time I finish speaking and hear laughter, I think Elsa Ingrid should see this. My cat, Mephisto, she should see it. Our house, the atmosphere inside. Mom, she could sit down and chat with her. The river outside, she should see it. And my records! She should listen to them, one by one. But our relationship didn't go this way; it's not that she wants to enter my world, but rather that I want to enter hers. Sometimes I think this will never happen, sometimes I think this good thing might suddenly change completely. I always see her, not with a searching or inquisitive look, nothing to do with that, no, just a glance here, a glance there, and that's enough for me. Then I look forward to the next opportunity to see her.\n[1985-03-12 10:00:00] Tewte | None None It is hard to imagine such a scene on cold days when the earth is covered with thick snow. Just a few months later, on a quiet and lifeless morning, the outdoors will be filled with green, vibrant, warm, and various kinds of life trembling in the air — from birds singing between trees to groups of insects moving about as if hanging in the air. The winter earth gave no warning; the scent of warmed heather and moss comes out, trees burst forth with sap, and lakes and puddles in springtime will be filled, letting the water flow. Now the only white visible is the clouds drifting across the blue sky, or the clouds passing over the blue river, where the river flows slowly toward the sea with its perfect cool gleaming surface, occasionally revealing rocks rising up like bodies emerging from a smooth surface. But it's not like that there — everything does not exist; all is white and quiet. The silence is broken by a gust of cold wind or the noisy call of a lonely raven. On a night in March, snow turned into rain, and the snow piles gradually shifted and pressed against each other. On an afternoon in April, buds sprouted on the trees, grass emerged from the ground, forcefully carving out a patch of green from the yellow. Daffodils popped up, followed by white and blue anemones. Suddenly, warm air filled the spaces between the trees on the hillside like pillars. On the sunny slopes, leaves are abundant, and among them, cherry blossoms bloom vigorously. Important rules:\n1.

Return only the translated text Amidst this storm of the heart, spring has arrived. At this moment, nothing can better summarize everything than unrestrained emotions. But it comes... it comes... at the age of sixteen, everything leaves an impression and leads you to reflect and explore, because it is your first spring, felt by all the organs of the body. Yet it is also the last spring, for all the following springs will fade in comparison with this first spring of life. If, moreover, you fall in love, yes, then... it becomes a question of whether you can bear it. Bearing all this joy, all this beauty, and the infinite possibilities of the future.\n[1985-03-12 16:00:00] Street | On the way home from school, I walked through a residential area. Tears welled up in my eyes. None I saw a pile of melted snow outside the asphalt road, the pattern looked like an arrow piercing a heart. I saw several boxes of fresh fruits under the awning in front of the store. A limping crow walked across the ground not far away. I raised my head towards the sky, which was so blue and clear, beautiful. At that time, rain began to fall. None None",

    "text": "[1985-03-15 10:00:00] School / Supermarket | At the same time, I was still doing what I had always done: going to school, playing football, hanging around with Vallund, reading books, listening to records, and sometimes meeting my father—on a few occasions by chance, for example once when I met him in a supermarket, where encountering him seemed a bit embarrassing, or perhaps it was his reaction to this extremely unnatural situation. There we were, pushing our respective shopping carts as if nothing had happened, then each going back on our own way. Another time was in the morning, when I was walking up the slope leading to the house, and he was driving down the slope, with a colleague sitting beside him. Now, when I see him, he has white hair all over his head, but he still looks young. However, our usual arrangement should be like this: either he would pass by my residence and we would go to my grandparents' house for dinner, or we would stay in his house, where he still kept as much distance from me as possible. I heard him say that I looked like an idiot, and he couldn't refuse me, so why would he want to look like an idiot himself. As my father, he felt ashamed. None None It seems he has given up on me, but he's not completely letting go either. Perhaps he might still suddenly launch into a scolding attack, just like that day when I had both my ears pierced, and we bumped into each other in the hallway.\n[1985-03-25 14:00:00] my place in town | Earlier that afternoon in March, I heard a car stop outside the residence. I went downstairs and looked out the window—it was Dad, holding a bag. I quickly returned to my room upstairs, not wanting to be one of those curious types pressing their nose against the glass. Hearing him rummaging around in the kitchen below, I put on a record by The Doors that Vallund had lent me; I’d wanted to hear it ever since reading Jens Orlo’s book on The Beatles. Then I took out a stack of newspaper clippings I’d collected about the Treholt spy case, convinced this exam would require them, and sat down to read—just as I heard his footsteps coming up the stairs. He looked very happy.\n[1985-03-25 14:10:00] my place in town | He walked in just as I glanced toward the door. He must have been holding a shopping list. I stood up. I heard him say, “Would you mind running to the store for me?” I said, “No problem.” He asked, “What are you reading?” I replied, “Nothing special, just some stuff related to the Leivik language course.” Bright sunlight poured across the floor. The windows were open, and I could hear birds singing outside, chirping to each other from the old apple tree just a few meters away.\n[1985-03-25 14:15:00] my place in town | Dad handed me the shopping list. I heard him say, “Your mother and I have decided to get divorced.” I said, “Huh?” He said, “Yes. But it won’t affect you. You won’t feel any difference. Besides, you’ll be an adult soon anyway—you’re moving out on your own in just two years.” I said, “Yeah, that’s true.” Dad said, “Okay?” I said, “Okay.” He said, “I forgot to write down potatoes. Maybe we could get something sweet for dessert? No, never mind. Here’s the money.”\n[1985-03-25 14:30:00] supermarket | He gave me a five-hundred-krone note, which I stuffed into my pocket before heading downstairs, onto the street, walking along the river and into the supermarket. I moved between the shelves, putting the items into my basket. Things Dad hadn’t mentioned, I tried adding in anyway. They’re getting divorced, fine, let them. I thought, if I were younger—eight or nine—maybe it would’ve meant something, made a real difference, but now it really doesn’t matter much. I have my own life.\n[1985-03-25 18:00:00] my place in town / church | I handed over the groceries, he made dinner, and we ate together without discussing anything particularly special. Then he left. That evening Elsa Ingrid was going to sing at church, and she’d already asked if I wanted to come see her—I naturally said yes. Her boyfriend was there too. I pretended not to know. When I saw her standing there, so saintly, so beautiful, I thought: she is mine, no one else feels for her the way I do. The asphalt road outside was covered with dust, and the remaining snow filled the potholes and shaded slopes along both sides of the road. I’m glad about this. She sings, and I am happy.\n[1985-03-25 21:00:00] street / residence | On my way home, I jumped off the bus and walked the final stretch through the city. When I got back, I lay down on my bed, and tears welled up in my eyes. The inner turmoil hadn’t lessened at all. My heart was filled with such intense emotions that I could barely bear it. These tears held no confusion, no sadness, no anger—only joy and happiness.\n[1985-03-26 15:00:00] school classroom | The next day we were alone in the classroom, everyone else gone, and both of us moved slowly. I told her she had sung wonderfully, perfectly. She stood there packing her bag. Then Niels came in. Her face was glowing. We had French class together. He was different from the other first-years—he hung out with older people at town bars, people who had independent views on things and lived independently. Maybe she wanted to hear what I thought about yesterday’s concert. I don’t like this—he keeps shadowing us like a ghost. He laughs too much, mocks everything, including me. When he does, I always feel insignificant, unsure where to look, what to say appropriately.\n[1985-03-26 15:10:00] school classroom | Now he started talking to Elsa Ingrid. It was as if a circle formed around her—watching her eyes, laughing, moving closer, standing very near. She didn’t reject him, didn’t resist his laughter. Even with me present, she opened herself to him—laughed with him, met his gaze, and when he leaned in, she even exposed her knees while sitting at the desk. For a moment he stared deep into her eyes, then burst into wicked laughter, stepped back a few paces, delivered some mock-surrender lines, raised his hand in a salute toward me, and disappeared. I wasn’t surprised by his behavior—that wasn’t what angered me. It was Elsa Ingrid’s reaction. As if he had cast a spell over her. Her eyes sparkled with excitement, tension, and unease.\n[1985-03-26 15:20:00] school classroom | I watched Elsa Ingrid with a burning jealousy, re-examining her like reviewing an old employee, yet seeing no visible change—inside, she had somehow reverted completely to her usual self. What had happened? Elsa Ingrid—sunlight, beauty, playfulness, joy, always with that puzzling, often childish question on her lips—what had changed in her? What had I seen? Darkness, depth, perhaps even violence—did she possess such qualities? She had answered that question, though only with a faint glimmer, yet it had appeared. Yes, in that instant, I was worthless. I was humiliated. All the notes I’d written her, all the topics we’d discussed, all my simple wishes and childish longings—worth nothing. A shout in the schoolyard, a pebble at the foot of a mountain, a car horn blaring. What could I do to her? Could I work on her, strive to make her my girlfriend? Could I do that with anyone else? No. To her, I was nothing. To me, she was everything.\n[1985-04-05 10:00:00] Sannes’ house | Two days later, Easter vacation began, and Mom came home. Dad said the divorce was finalized, completely over. When Mom arrived, she drove straight to the house, where Dad waited for her. They stayed together for two days, while I wandered around town trying to pass the time. I tried to ignore what I’d seen about her, and my attitude toward her, maintaining things as they used to be, pretending nothing was wrong. But it wasn’t true—I knew that, absolutely certain. My only hope was that she wouldn’t notice. But what kind of dream did I actually believe in? I understood clearly it wasn’t like that for her.\n[1985-04-05 16:00:00] outside Sannes' house | On Friday she parked her car outside. I saw her from a window. She had a huge bruise around one eye. I opened the door.",

I passed out—sometimes I do, you know—and then I went straight into the edge above the table. You know, that glass table.\" I said, \"I don't believe it.\" She insisted, \"It's true, I fainted. Nothing else.\"\n[1985-04-05 16:10:00] kitchen of Sannes' house | I stepped back. She walked into the hallway. She set the box down on the floor and hung the light-colored coat on a hook. I asked, \"Are you divorced now?\" She said, \"Yes, we are.\" I asked, \"Are you sad?\" She said, \"Sad? I don't know, maybe a little. What about you? How is it for you?\" I said, \"Fine, as long as I don't have to live with Dad.\" She said, \"We talked about that too. But now I need a cup of coffee first.\" She looked at me so directly, as if she hadn't even considered such a possibility.\n[1985-04-05 16:15:00] kitchen of Sannes' house | I followed her into the kitchen, watching as she filled the coffee pot with water, sat down in a chair with her handbag on her lap, pulled out a pack of cigarettes, took one out and lit it. She looked at me. I heard her say, \"I'm moving in. We'll live in the main house. Dad will stay here. Probably I'll have to buy his half first—I'm not entirely sure how to make that happen, but there must be a way.\" I said, \"Okay.\" Clearly, during her time in Baysang, she had already started smoking Barclay cigarettes.\n[1985-04-05 16:20:00] kitchen of Sannes' house | I heard her say, \"And you? How are things with you? You know, it's really good to see you now.\" I said, \"Same here. I haven't seen you since New Year's. So much has happened.\" She said, \"Really?\" She stood up, took an ashtray from the cabinet, and also brought out a bag of coffee, placing it on the counter. I said, \"Yes.\" She smiled and said, \"Looks like some good things, right?\" I said, \"Yeah, I'm in love. That's all there is to it.\" The water began making a soft hissing sound, which near the edge felt a bit like being close to the sea.\n[1985-04-05 16:25:00] kitchen of Sannes' house | I heard her say, \"That's wonderful. Do I know her?\" I said, \"Who would I know? No, someone from class. It might seem a bit silly, but that's just how it is. It didn't go according to plan either.\" She said, \"Ah, no? What's her name?\" I said, \"Elsa Ingrid.\" She smiled slightly. \"Elsa Ingrid—when can I meet her?\" I said, \"That's the thing. We're not together. She's with someone else.\" She said, \"So it's not so easy after all.\" I said, \"No.\" She sighed. \"Yeah, things don't always go the way we want. But you look radiant, and happy too.\" I said, \"I've never been this happy. Never.\"\n[1985-04-05 16:30:00] kitchen of Sannes' house | For some impulsive reason, tears welled up in my eyes as I spoke. They rolled down my cheeks on their own. I laughed. I sobbed once. Finally, I had to wipe the tears from my face with my hand. Luckily, just then the water boiled, so I could go over, take the pot off the stove, pour the water in, press the lid down, stamp the pot a few times on the burner, and take out two cups. When I placed them on the table, everything was back to normal. I said, \"These are actually tears of joy.\" Not moist glimmers, like when I usually see something touching—nothing like that.\n[1985-07-15 20:00:00] Yttersjøen Southberge farm | I heard their loud conversation rising from the living room downstairs. I remember those summers when we visited my grandparents, and my father had discussions with him. Everyone was ready for bed, and for my father, these talks had defined limits—their sole purpose was to point out to Kjelltan how delusional he was. But to Kjelltan, it was a matter of life and death, sharply divided. Even though back then I couldn’t articulate it clearly, I could sense the deep-rooted rift between them. That’s why my father’s voice carried irritation, and Kjelltan’s carried passion. Just as clearly—at least to me—my father’s words were grounded in the real world: what he said and thought belonged here, connected to us, to our student days, football matches, comic strips, fishing trips, snow shoveling, and Saturday porridge. But Kjelltan spoke of something else, something tied to another place.\n[1985-07-15 21:00:00] Yttersjøen Southberge farm | He simply couldn’t accept that what he had devoted his entire life to believing had nothing to do with reality—as my father and everyone else claimed in every situation. Reality wasn’t the way Kjelltan described it, and never would be. This marked him as a dreamer. But he wasn’t dreaming at all! He was talking precisely about concrete, material, physical, tangible reality! The irony of the situation was intense. He defended theories of unity and solidarity, yet he himself was the one excluded and isolated. He was the one who viewed the world through idealized and abstract lenses—the one whose soul was purer than everyone else’s, the one who bore burdens and carried loads, hammered and struck, welded and tightened screws, crawled and climbed across boat after boat, milked cows and fed them, shoveled manure into the pit and spread it on the fields in spring, harvested grass and made silage, repaired houses and cared for his mother, who needed more help each passing year. This became his life.\n[1985-07-25 22:35:00] bus stop by the waterfall / hill road toward Sannes | Half a year later, on a night at the end of July, I jumped off the last bus at the bus stop by the waterfall. After attending a football training camp in Baywick, instead of going home first, I went to a class reunion held on the islands. I climbed the hill toward the paved road along the roadside. I turned a corner, below which stood a house where an old man sat in his living room watching television. A sailor’s backpack on my shoulder. It was a few minutes past ten-thirty, night had fallen, covering the land like a gray veil. The waterfall roared beneath me. Below the sloping meadow stood a row of deciduous trees growing along the riverbank. Above, an old farmstead—an already dilapidated barn facing the road stood open. There was no light inside the main house. On the opposite side of the river, a tractor trailer came into view. Its sound reached me first; I heard it before the vehicle appeared, as it shifted gears and slowly continued its climb upward. Then the trailer emerged. Above the treetops, against the overcast sky, two bats fluttered in flight. I felt joyful. I thought about the badger I often encountered on the last bus ride home. When I started climbing the hill, it usually darted down the stream toward the road. To be safe, I always kept a stone in my hand. Sometimes we met on the path, and then it would stop and stare at me before running back to its distinctive hiding spot.\n[1985-07-25 22:40:00] hillside path | I stood there, swung my backpack off my shoulder, put one foot up on a roadside stone, and lit a cigarette. I had lived here with my mother through an entire winter and half a summer; she was now in Sørbygda. She hadn't yet bought out my father's half of the property—according to his rights, he and his new girlfriend Winnie were living there until school started again. I didn't want to go home just yet, wanted to delay a few more minutes.\n[1985-07-25 22:42:00] hillside path | I watched it until it disappeared from sight, leaving only the rumbling sound, which faded gradually until vanishing completely as the plane landed at Rogaland Airport. A huge airplane flew over the treetops, slowly tilting sideways. A few seconds after passing overhead, it leveled out again. Bright flashes blinked at the tips of both wings, and the landing gear beneath the fuselage was unfolding. I've always loved airplanes—even after living under the flight path for three years, I still watch their takeoffs and landings with pleasure.\n[1985-07-25 22:45:00] hillside path / near William's house | I dabbed the cigarette against my tongue, then flicked the butt down the slope, hoisted my backpack onto my shoulder, and continued walking upward. The river shimmered in the summer darkness. The smoke from my cigarette didn't rise—it drifted apart like a thin mist suspended in the air. Not a breath of wind. Now that the roar of the plane had vanished, there was no sound at all. No—there was: the fluttering cries of bats, spiraling and darting with the flapping of their wings. The house with lights on is where William lives. Above the next bend, the dense canopy of tall trees completely blocked out the sky. From the marshy area between the road and the river came the croaking of frogs or toads.",

I stepped over to the other side of the road, trying not to startle the passerby, but it spotted me and immediately stopped. I kept walking, stepped over the stone foundation, and stood quietly on the steep embankment below. When I returned to the road, I heard faint music. It was a badger. It hadn't noticed me yet, trotting across the asphalt. The badger hissed, continuing to stare at me. Suddenly it turned and lumbered away slowly, disappearing into the terrain above. The music had been there all along—I just hadn’t noticed it until now. Ah, that badger was so beautiful—the black-and-white striped snout so strikingly stylish! Its fur was gray, golden eyes gleaming with cunning. Clearly assessing the situation, because previously whenever I startled it, it would instantly turn and vanish without a trace. Now it did it again, disappearing into the landscape above, filling me with great delight.\n[1985-07-25 22:50:00] outside Sannes' yard | I hurried down the final stretch of road, then climbed back up the slope. The house glowed brightly with electric lights. The music was coming from there—probably through the open door. On the upper level, several shifting silhouettes moved about the lawn, vague and indistinct in the dim, pale light of the summer night. Was that music coming from our house? I thought there was a party going on up there. Normally I’d approach the house from the west along the stream, but since there was a gathering, and strangers everywhere around front and back, I didn’t want to just step out of the woods directly into it, so I took a long detour along the road.\n[1985-07-25 22:55:00] Sannes' yard / garden | When I reached the top, I paused briefly to compose myself. I saw a man in a white shirt walking toward the yard, unaware of me. I peered in through the window. The entire driveway was packed with cars, half of them parked on the lawn. More vehicles were lined up beside the barn and inside the yard. The garden behind the house buzzed with voices. In the kitchen, two women and a man stood by the table, each holding a drink, laughing as they sipped.\n[1985-07-25 22:56:00] Sannes' garden long table | I took a deep breath and walked toward the front door. I set my backpack down beside the door and walked over to him. I heard him say, 'You're here, Grete Lundnes.' He placed his hand on my shoulder. 'We thought you'd come earlier. We're having a little party, as you see. But you can sit with us for a while, can't you? Sit here!' A long table stood in the garden leading into the woods. The white tablecloth spread over it gave off a faint glow in the shadowy darkness beneath the tree canopy. Six or seven people sat around the table, including Dad. When our eyes met, he stood up and waved to me. I’d never seen him like this before. He wore a loose white shirt with lace trim along the V-neck, blue jeans, and light brown leather shoes. His face, nearly sun-baked to dark brown, shone with a deep tan. His eyes sparkled.\n[1985-07-25 22:58:00] Sannes' garden long table | I did as he said, sitting down at the table with my back to the house. I nodded to the other five people. He lit a cigarette, drew in some smoke, exhaled, wearing a look of deep contentment. I said, 'Hi, Winnie.' I heard Dad say, 'This is Grete Lundnes, my youngest son.' He said, 'And this is Bodil, Grete Lundnes, my cousin.' She smiled at me and said, 'We used to play together when we were kids, your father and I.' Dad said, 'Back in our youth.' Dad said, 'And here are Ragnvald, Ellen, Marthe, Erling, and Åge. These are my colleagues.' I said, 'Hi.' Of these people, Winnie was the only one I’d ever seen before. She was also wearing a white shirt or something like a knit sweater. I’d never heard him mention a cousin named Bodil before—perhaps my eyes showed a hint of question as I looked at her.\n[1985-07-25 23:00:00] Sannes' garden long table | He put down his glass and said, 'Did you go to that training camp?' I nodded. 'In Baywick.' 'Which part of Baywick?' 'Nikben.' 'On Mossøya?' 'Yes, I think so. An island in the Lyngdalsfjord.' He laughed, looking around and said, 'That’s Axel Sandemose’s hometown!' Then he looked straight at me and asked, 'Do you know he created a law inspired by that very town you just visited?' I saw the table filled with glasses and bottles, trays and plates. Two large bowls overflowed with shrimp shells—clearly leftovers from their meal. The last person my father mentioned, Åge, was in his forties, wearing large glasses with thin, delicate frames. As he looked at me, he took a small sip of beer.\n[1985-07-25 23:01:00] Sannes' garden long table | I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'And what was it?' I said, 'Jante Law.' He said, 'Exactly!' Dad asked, 'Did you have a good time there?' I said, 'Yes, great facilities. The town was nice too.' What on earth is this? Are we suddenly back in school class? I didn’t want to talk more, nor give him a chance to speak further. When I raised my eyes and met his gaze, I saw stubbornness mixed with shyness.\n[1985-07-25 23:02:00] Nikkebin (memory) | Nikkebin: After spending the entire night and morning outside with a girl I'd just met, I walked back toward the school where I was staying. She was crazy about me. The other four from the team had left earlier, so it was only her and me. As I walked home, drunk more than usual, I stopped in front of a house in town. All the details have vanished. I don't remember how I left her, or how I got there. But standing there in front of that house, it was as if my senses suddenly returned. I took the cigarette glowing red from my mouth, opened the mailbox on the door, and tossed the cigarette inside so it fell onto the floor of the hallway. Then came another wave of dizziness—I had to somehow get myself back to the school dormitory, go inside, collapse into bed, and was woken up the next morning for breakfast, then trained for three hours. It wasn't until we were sitting together beneath a huge deciduous tree at the training ground that I suddenly remembered what I'd done. A chill ran through me. I stood up abruptly, kicked the ball away, and started running after it. What if it had caught fire? Could someone have died in the flames? What would I do then?\n[1985-07-25 23:03:00] Sannes' garden long table | I had been happy throughout those training days, but now, on the first evening back home, as I sat beside the long dining table in the garden, fear crept over me again.\n[1985-07-25 23:05:00] Sannes' garden long table | I heard one of them ask, 'Which team do you play for, Grete Lundnes?' I said, 'Tveit.' He said, 'Which division are you in?' I said, 'I'm in the youth team, but the senior team is in the fifth district.' He said, 'Not Stat Club, certainly not there.' I said, 'No, more like Vembjart Football Club.' Everyone laughed. From his accent, I realized he was from Vinne, so he enjoyed being precise. I lowered my eyes. I felt I was getting too much attention. But then, when my gaze briefly met my father's, he smiled at me. Truly, his eyes sparkled.\n[1985-07-25 23:06:00] Sannes' garden long table | I nod. I heard him say, 'Don’t you want a beer, Grete Lundnes?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Looks like the drinks here are finished, but there’s a case in the kitchen. You can go get a bottle.'",

    "text": "[1985-07-25 23:10:00] Sannes' hallway/kitchen | I stand up. As I walk toward the door, two more people come in—a man and a woman, their bodies entwined. They don’t move forward any further. I hear her say, 'Hey! You’re the son, right?' I say, 'Yes, hi.' She says, 'I work with your father.' I say, 'Nice to meet you.' She wears a white summer dress. Her bare arms and legs are brown. Her breasts are heavy, her belly and hips broad. Yet the eyes in her full face are gentle. The man, wearing a light blue shirt and white trousers, has a slight belly, but is otherwise well-built. Though he smiles, his drunken eyes wander restlessly, and I notice his facial expression is stiff. On that frozen face, only the lines in the skin are visible, like dried-up riverbeds.\n[1985-07-25 23:12:00] Sannes' kitchen | When I reach the hallway, I see the bathroom door open. A short, stocky, bespectacled woman with black hair steps out. She glances at me, then lowers her eyes and walks past into the room. Carefully, I sniff the perfume drifting from her body, then follow behind him into the house. I enter the kitchen and see the three people I’d seen through the window sitting there. The man, around forty, whispers into the ear of the woman on his right. She laughs, but it’s a polite, perfunctory smile. The other woman sits with a handbag on her lap, rummaging through it. She looks up at me and places an unopened pack of cigarettes on the table. I say, 'Hi, I’m just here to grab a beer.' The scent of fresh flowers.\n[1985-07-25 23:15:00] Sannes' kitchen | Two full cases of beer stand against the wall by the door. I take a bottle from the top case. The man stands up and slaps his thigh. He flicks his lower arm forward slowly—giving me time to prepare—but still, I stumble slightly forward. The lighter flies through the air, hits the doorframe with a clink, and drops to the floor. I say, 'Does anyone have a bottle opener?' He says, 'I’ve got a lighter.' I say, 'I don’t know how to open bottles with a lighter—maybe you could help me?' Had this scene not happened, I wouldn’t have known how to extricate myself—because then he would have opened the bottle for me in a paternal way, which I didn’t want. But now, since he offered first yet failed midway, the situation completely reversed itself.\n[1985-07-25 23:16:00] Sannes' kitchen | I pick up the lighter from the floor and hand it to him along with the beer bottle. He holds the lighter, gives a soft 'pop,' and the cap flies off. He hands me the bottle. He says, 'There you go.' I notice he wears round glasses, half his head bald, while on the other side, the hair rises high at the edge of his scalp like the outermost wave at an endless beach—forever unable to climb higher, leaving him somehow discouraged, lacking confidence. At least, that’s the impression he leaves on me. His tense fingers are hairy. A silver watch chain circles his wrist.\n[1985-07-25 23:20:00] Sannes' garden | I thank him, walk through the living room, see four or five people dancing, then step out into the garden. A small group gathers near the flagpole, each holding their drink, gazing out over the valley as they talk. The taste of the beer feels incredibly wonderful. In Baywick, I drank every night, all through the previous evening and night, so now I’d need a lot to actually get drunk. But I don’t want that either. If I get completely intoxicated, I’ll slip into their world, be fully absorbed and blended in, become no different from them—perhaps even start fantasizing about their women. That’s exactly what I most hope won’t happen.\n[1985-07-25 23:25:00] Sannes' garden | I look outward. The river winds slowly around a narrow, grassy strip where a goal net stands upright, entering the channel bordered by two rows of tall trees. The dark trees face the leaden water shimmering with pale light. Across the river rise gently ascending hills, rolling and undulating until they reach the sea, also cloaked in darkness. A line of houses between the river and the hills spills out bright, clear lights. The stars near the horizon glow in a hazy hue; deep in the night sky, faint blue stars are barely visible.\n[1985-07-25 23:30:00] deep in the Sannes family garden | The group near the flagpole were laughing about something. The man with a small belly came around the corner of the house, as if he were gliding along the ground. I took a sip of my drink and walked deeper into the far end of the garden, where it seemed no one else had yet discovered this path. There, I sat down close to a birch tree, crossing my legs. The music had grown distant, and so had the voices and laughter; their activities over there became more blurred. Their hazy silhouettes drifted like ghosts around the brightly lit house. They stood only a few meters away from me, yet their faces remained indistinct. My confirmation ceremony photo was taken there, in front of the flagpole, standing between Dad and Mom.\n[1985-07-25 23:35:00] deep in the Sannes family garden | I thought of Elsa Ingrid. It was as if she truly occupied a specific place within me, somewhere in my heart, and that I was always with her. In truth, I could go there whenever I wanted, whenever I felt I absolutely had to. We sat outside the Svaberg campsite talking about the class gathering from the night before. Nothing happened—just being together. Svaberg, Elsa Ingrid, the bay with its low, shallow islets, the sea. We danced, played games, walked down the steps from the house, swam in the dark water. It was utterly exhilarating. That exhilaration never tired, it stayed alive inside me all day long, and it’s alive in me now. I am eternal. I stood up, aware that it was by the power of every single cell in my body. I wore a gray T-shirt, knee-length olive-green pants, and white Adidas basketball shoes—nothing more, but it was enough. I wouldn’t call myself strong, but I was slender, supple, agile, handsome like a god.\n[1985-07-25 23:40:00] deep in the Sannes family garden | Could I call her? She should be home tonight. But it must be nearly midnight. Even if she wouldn’t mind being woken, disturbing the rest of her household would be hard to justify. What if the house caught fire? Could someone die in the flames? Ah, damn it, fucking damn it.\n[1985-07-25 23:45:00] Sannes family garden/kitchen | I began walking across the lawn, trying to push all these thoughts aside, letting my gaze glide along the hedge fence, past the house and roof, all the way to a large cluster of lilac bushes at the far end of the grass. As I walked, I finished the last drops of beer in my bottle. I saw several flushed female faces, their legs bent as they sat on the steps, cigarettes dangling between their fingers. I recognized them as I passed the table, gave a small smile, went through the door into the living room, then the kitchen, which was now completely empty. I grabbed another beer, went upstairs to my own room, sat down in the chair by the window, tilted my head back, and closed my eyes. The heavy, purple blooms of the lilac bush filled the entire path downward with their rich fragrance.\n[1985-07-25 23:50:00] a second-floor room in the Sannes house | Just like this. The speaker from the living room was right below me; the whole house was completely unshielded, and every single note came through clearly. What song are they playing? Anni-Frid Lyngstad. A summer hit from last year. What’s popular now, anyway?\n[1985-07-25 23:55:00] a second-floor room in the Sannes house | In my memory, he always dressed simply, precisely, leaning toward conservative. His wardrobe consisted of shirts, suits, blazers—mostly patterned—with trousers made of polyester, corduroy, or cotton, and sweaters of wool or lambswool. Tonight, Dad’s clothes looked mismatched, almost absurd. A white shirt—or was it a blouse, or whatever the hell you’d call it? He belonged to the older generation of teachers, not the new kind who didn’t care about appearance, but neither was he from the old-fashioned era. The difference wasn’t really about that. It lay between softness and hardness, between trying to erase that distance and trying to maintain it. It was a matter of values. When he suddenly showed up wearing an embroidered artistic top or pleated shirt—the way I saw him this past spring—or casual leather shoes, looking just like everyone else enjoying themselves, the gap between the image he projected and who he actually was grew vast, and I knew him well enough to see that.\n[1985-07-25 23:58:00] a second-floor room in the Sannes house | I myself stand on the side of the vulnerable. I oppose war and those in power, resist institutions of authority at every level and all forms of dominance. I don’t want to be crammed full at school, but I do wish my intelligence were better organized. Politically, I lean left; the unfair distribution of the world’s resources makes me want to curse aloud. I believe wealth in society should be shared equally, making capitalism and the ruling elite my sworn enemies. I mean, every person has equal value, and inner qualities matter far more than outward appearances. In other words, I favor depth over surface, praise beauty over evil, support the weak against the strong. So logically, shouldn’t I be happy that my father has moved toward the softer side? No—this is only the appearance of softness. Those round glasses, corduroy pants, snug shoes, knitted sweaters—I feel almost contempt for them, because alongside these political beliefs, I hold others too.\n[1985-07-26 00:00:00] a second-floor room in the Sannes house | Ian McCulloch, lead singer of Echo & the Bunnymen, was a pioneer within this worldview. Coats, military jackets, basketball shoes, black sunglasses. Ideas tightly bound to music—in that world, quality and coolness are measured by an entirely different standard, one firmly tied to our present moment. It expresses the spirit of the age, not the part that chases the pop charts, not soft colors and hairspray charm, since those are tied to sales, to image-making and entertainment. No, it must express innovation rooted in tradition; deep feeling combined with nimble liveliness; sharp intelligence paired with simplicity and sincerity, free of pretense. Real music isn’t for everyone, isn’t the best-selling, yet it still captures an era—my era, my experiences and journey. Ah, a brand-new age. I stand on the side of the new age. This is far removed from my father’s embroidered shirt and Sami boots. On the other hand, it’s understandable—he belongs to a different generation. Imagining people from his time starting to dress like Ian McCulloch, listening to underground American bands like Husker Dü, obsessing over events on U.S. television, following debut albums by R.E.M. or Green on Red, or mixing cowboy fringes into their wardrobes—this feels almost like a nightmare. The point is, the embroidered shirt and Sami boots were never truly him. Yet he still quietly slips into this role, as if drifting into disorder and confusion, almost like a fragile woman, as if he’s completely lost himself. Even the hardness in his voice has disappeared.\n[1985-07-26 00:05:00] a second-floor room in the Sannes house | I opened my eyes and turned around so I could see through the window to the table by the edge of the woods. I saw someone standing there urinating, gazing out toward the river. I saw Dad lift his head, his eyes staring straight toward the window. My heartbeat quickened, but I didn’t move—if he really saw me—I couldn’t be sure—but moving would have admitted I was spying. Instead, I waited a moment, until I was certain he saw me seeing him, if indeed he had seen me at all, and only then did I step back and sit down at my desk. Now there were only four people left. Dad, Winnie, the woman who called herself Bodil, and one other. Behind the lilac bushes, out of their line of sight, but I could see them clearly. Observing Dad was possible—he was always vigilant, sealed tight, nothing escaped his notice. He absorbed every detail, big or small.\n[1985-07-26 00:10:00] a second-floor room in the Sannes house | I took a few sips of beer. Now a cigarette would feel incredibly good. He’s never seen me smoke—maybe if I did, it would become a topic between us. Then again, would he perhaps even encourage me to grab another beer?",

    "text": "[1985-07-26 00:15:00] Sannes' second-floor room | I set down the wine bottle, spun the record rack around a few times, and read the names written in my own childish handwriting along the spines of the record cases in capital letters: BOWIE—HUNKY DORY. LED ZEPPELIN—I. TALKING HEADS—77. THE CHAMELEONS—SCRIPT OF THE BRIDGE. THE THE—SOUL MINING. THE STRANGLERS—RATTUS NORVEGICUS. THE POLICE—OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR. TALKING HEADS—REMAIN IN LIGHT. BOWIE—SCARY MONSTERS (And super creeps). ENO BYRNE—MY LIFE IN THE BUSH OF GHOSTS. U2—OCTOBER. THE BEATLES—RUBBER SOUL. SIMPLE MINDS—NEW GOLD DREAM. The desk is the object I own with the longest memory; it's orange-red, the same color as my bed and the cabinet door from my old room. Now, except for the record shelf, the desk is completely empty. I had cleared everything out by the end of school, and aside from sleeping, this place serves almost no other function.\n[1985-07-26 00:20:00] Sannes' second-floor room | I stood up, picked up the guitar near the small Roland Cube amplifier, strummed a few chords, then put it back in place and looked out toward the garden. This brother of my grandfather had long ago been excluded from the family. I myself first learned about him only a few years ago by chance, at a family wedding where he gave an impassioned speech. He was a lay preacher in the city’s Pentecostal church. A mechanic. He differed from his two other brothers in every way—even in name. Those three sons, persuaded and guided by their solemn and dignified mother, all decided to enter the academic world, beginning at university, and even changed their surname, replacing the rather ordinary Petersen with the more distinctive Grete Lundnes. He refused. They were still sitting there, in the dimness beneath the tree canopy, the two gas lamps now faint but still glowing, their faces slightly drained of color in the distant light. Dark, nearly copper-toned complexions. Bodil must be the daughter of my grandfather’s other brother—I’ve never seen her before. Could that be why he broke with the family?\n[1985-07-26 00:25:00] Sannes' hallway | I walked out of the room and down the stairs. When I reached the hallway, I saw Dad standing in the room where the wardrobe was kept. The light wasn’t on, and he looked at me. He tilted his head slightly and smoothed his hair with his hand. I heard him say, “You’re here? Don’t you want to sit with us?” I said, “Yes, of course. Just walking around, looking.” He said, “A great party. You doing alright, Grete Lundnes?” I said, “Fine, nothing wrong. I’ll come out and sit down now.” He always had that gesture, but as for the jacket and trousers—they didn’t suit him at all, as if suddenly feminized. Conservative, traditional clothing, worn with meticulous care, had always been his style, just like that inherited gesture and his usual precision.\n[1985-07-26 00:30:00] Sannes' garden | When I stepped outside. A gust of wind came through. The leaves at the edge of the woods stirred slightly, reluctantly, as if waking from a deep sleep. There was no other reason—he was simply drunk, I thought. Because this wasn’t how I knew him. My father never drank. The first time I’d ever seen him thoroughly intoxicated was two months earlier one evening when I visited him and Winnie at their apartment on Elve Street. They hosted me for fondue, something they’d never done before—a Friday night dinner at home like that had never happened. They’d already been drinking before I arrived. Though he was still friendly, there was a sense of threat—certainly not direct, because I didn’t feel afraid sitting there, but indirect, because I could no longer read him. It was as if all the knowledge I’d accumulated about him throughout childhood, the ability I’d developed to anticipate what would happen, had suddenly and completely failed. What was going on? Why couldn’t I read him anymore? What was this?\n[1985-07-26 00:35:00] Sannes' garden long table | When I turned and continued walking toward the table, I met Winnie’s gaze. She smiled at me, and I returned the smile. When I reached them. I heard Winnie say, “You’re doing okay?” I said, “Yes, but I’m a bit tired—I think I’ll go to sleep soon.” She said, “Can you sleep with all this noise?” I said, “It’s not noisy at all!” Another gust of wind passed through, stronger this time. The leaves of the waist-high bushes in front of the barn steps rustled loudly. The lightest branches above the dining table swayed up and down.\n[1985-07-26 00:40:00] Sannes' garden long table | I heard Bodil say, “Your father said many good things about you tonight—can you believe it?” I heard Bodil ask, “Isn’t that right, Winnie?” Winnie nodded. She said, “We read one of your essays here in the spring—you might not know? I hope you don’t mind that I read it? He’s really proud of you, you know?” Her long hair was completely gray, though she was barely over thirty. Dad had been her supervisor during her teaching practice at the teacher training college. She wore a loose green blouse similar in style to his. Around her neck hung a wooden bead necklace. She leaned forward across the table. I didn’t know what to say, so I smiled cautiously. Ah, I was utterly speechless. What the hell did my essay have to do with her? But clearly, it was meant as a compliment.\n[1985-07-26 00:45:00] Sannes' garden long table | I heard Bodil say, “You look like your grandfather, Grete Lundnes. Same shape of the head. Same mouth.” I said, “Are you Dad’s cousin?” She said, “Yes, you should come visit us sometime. You know, we also live in Vesfjord!” I said I’d be happy to visit, asked about her job, and gradually started asking whether she had children or not. I don’t know. Before I came here, I didn’t even know she existed. I should have said that. But I didn’t.\n[1985-07-26 00:50:00] Sannes' garden long table | While she was speaking, I saw Dad return. He sat down to listen, as if wanting to join the conversation, but then leaned back, placed one foot on the opposite knee, and lit a cigarette. I stood up, walked to the door, opened my backpack, took out cigarettes, put one in my mouth, and walked back. Halfway, I paused briefly to light it, so that when I sat down, I was already smoking. Dad said nothing. I heard him say, “Now that I’m back, you’re leaving?” I said, “No, I just went to get something.” I saw he wanted to say something—the hint of displeasure already visible at the corners of his mouth—but after that brief, dark glance, it all vanished completely, as if he had already told himself he was no longer that kind of person. At least, that’s what I thought.\n[1985-07-26 00:55:00] Sannes' garden long table | They drank, looking into each other’s eyes. I shook my head. He raised a bottle of white wine across the table and filled their glasses. We clinked glasses again. I heard Dad say, “Well then, cheers, everyone.” Then he looked at Bodil and added, “To Helene.” Bodil said, “To Helene.” Dad said, “You haven’t toasted yet, Grete Lundnes.” He said, “Grab a glass over there—it’s clean. Right, Winnie?” She nodded. Who the hell is this Helene?\n[1985-07-26 01:00:00] Sannes' garden long table | I looked at them and asked, “Who is Helene?” Bodil said, “Helene was my sister—she has passed away.” Dad said, “Helene was… yes, we were very close during my childhood. We spent all our time together until we were about ten. Then she got sick.” I took another sip. From behind the house emerged the two people I’d seen earlier—the sturdy woman in the white dress and the man with a small belly. Two others followed behind them; I recognized one of them, the man from the kitchen.\n[1985-07-26 01:05:00] Sannes family garden long table | He put one hand on Dad's shoulder. I heard the man with a little belly say, 'So here you are sitting—we've been wondering about you. You're not taking good care of your guests, I must say that. We came up here first and foremost to see you.' Bodil whispered to me, 'That's my sister, Elisabeth, and her husband, Frank. They live down in Ryen, you know, by the riverbank. He's a real estate agent.' All these people Dad knows—have they always been living around us?\n[1985-07-26 01:10:00] Sannes family garden long table | They sat down at the table and instantly came alive. When I arrived here, these faces were blank, meaningless and empty, so all I saw was their age and type, roughly like looking at animals—a herd of forty-year-olds, with dull eyes, stiff lips, sagging breasts, trembling bellies, wrinkles and flab. Now I see individuals, simple human beings, and I am one of their kin, blood flowing through their veins just as it does through mine. Who they are suddenly matters.\n[1985-07-26 01:15:00] Sannes family garden long table | I heard Dad say, 'We were sitting here talking about Helene.' The man called Frank said, 'Helene, yes, I never met her. But I’ve heard a lot about her. It’s such a pity how things turned out.' Dad said, 'I was sitting by her bedside when she died. I valued her. Deeply valued her.' Bodil, still in that low voice, said to me, 'She was the most beautiful person you could ever imagine.' I stared at him. What’s happening now?\n[1985-07-26 01:20:00] Sannes family garden long table | He sat there with his elbows on the table, hands folded across his chest, while tears streamed down his cheeks. Frank looked down, fiddling with his wine glass. Winnie placed her hand on Dad's arm. Bodil watched them. My father closed his eyes and covered his face with his hands. I heard Dad say, 'She just died like that, oh, ohhh.' Bodil said, 'You were closest to her. You were her dearest one.' My father said, 'Oh, oh.' He cried? Yes, he cried.\n[1985-07-26 01:25:00] Sannes family garden long table | I raised my glass and drank. Another gust of wind swept over the yard. The hanging corners of the tablecloth fluttered upward. A napkin was blown away and landed on the lawn. The leafy trees above us rustled noisily. The sharp taste filled my mouth, sending shivers through me, immediately followed by that clear, pure sensation of nearing drunkenness—yet not quite reaching it—arousing a craving for the intoxicating euphoria that always follows close behind.",

These facts may have changed the meaning of life, but not its content. Life continued as before, along the same course: rising at dawn to milk the cows, feeding the cattle, taking the bus to the shipyard, working all day, returning home to care for his parents—if his mother could walk, helping her take a few laps across the living room floor; otherwise, sitting down to massage her legs, assisting her to the toilet, perhaps preparing her clothes for the next day, doing all necessary outdoor chores, whether leading the cows or milking them, and then going back to his own house, eating dinner, sleeping until the next morning—unless Grandma fell seriously ill, forcing Grandpa to call him in the night. This was Kjertan’s life, as it appeared from the outside.\n[1986-12-24 19:00:00] Yttersøndre Borg farm | His period as a Communist began when I was only two or three years old, and when it ended—at least the active, vibrant part of it—I had just finished primary school. So by the time I turned sixteen and started becoming interested in who people 'were,' that chapter of his life was merely a hazy backdrop within my impression of him. Far more significant was the fact that he wrote poetry. Not because I particularly liked poetry, but because the poems 'revealed' much more about him. You don’t write poetry unless you have to—that is, unless you are a poet. He didn’t talk to us about writing, but neither did he hide it. We knew, somehow. One year some of his poems were published in Tid og Sted, and another year Class Struggle published a few—poems about the everyday lives of industrial workers, small and simple impressions. Though they occupied little space, they earned him recognition among the book-loving Hartlev family. When one of his poems appeared on the back cover of the literary magazine Vinduet, accompanied by a small portrait of him, and then, years later, his poems filled two full pages in the same magazine, he had become, in our eyes, a poet in his prime.\n[1986-12-24 20:00:00] Yttersøndre Borg farm | It was precisely at this time that he began reading philosophy. One night, sitting in the house high above the fjord, he opened Being and Time and began grappling with Heidegger’s extremely difficult German—perhaps word by word, since as far as I know, he hadn’t read or spoken German since leaving school—and also with the poets Heidegger mentioned, especially Hölderlin and the pre-Socratics, and Nietzsche, Nietzsche. He later described reading Heidegger as 'coming home.' Without exaggeration, he found immense fulfillment in it. It was a religious experience. An awakening. A conversion. The old world was infused with new meaning.\n[1986-12-24 21:00:00] Yttersøndre Borg farm | By then my father had already left the family, so Henrik Inge, Mother, and I began spending Christmas Eve at my grandparents’ place. Kjertan, now thirty-five or thirty-six, still lived and worked there. Without a doubt, the four or five Christmas Eves we spent there were among the most memorable of my entire Christmas experience. Grandma was ill, sitting trembling at the table. Her hands shook, and so did her arms, head, and feet. She would occasionally convulse, at which point she had to be laid on a chair, her legs bent forcefully, then massaged. Yet her mind was clear, her eyes alert—she could see us, and was happy to do so. Grandpa was short and round, lively and humorous, always ready with a story, often laughing so hard at his own tales that tears streamed down his face. But such moments were rare, because Kjertan was there—he had spent an entire year immersed in Heidegger, his mind filled with Heidegger, trapped in endless, meaningless labor, with no one to share it with, since within several kilometers no one had ever heard of Heidegger, nor wanted to listen—even though I suspect he tried—surely he must have—but to no avail. No one understood. No one wanted to understand. He could only find joy in it alone.\n[1986-12-24 22:00:00] Yttersøndre Borg farm | I heard him speak of Heidegger, entirely self-contained, disconnected from the outside world—of 'Dasein' and 'the They,' of Trakl and Hölderlin, the great poet Hölderlin, of Heraclitus and Socrates, of Nietzsche and Plato, of birds in trees and waves in the fjord, of human Dasein and the emergence of Being, of the sun in the sky and rain in the air, of cats’ eyes and waterfalls plunging straight down. Later, our family arrived: his sister Sissel, a nursing instructor with interests in politics, literature, and philosophy; her son Henrik Inge, who was studying at university—Kjertan had always dreamed of attending university, and in recent years this longing had grown stronger; and her daughter Grete Lundnes. I was seventeen then, in upper secondary school. Though I didn’t understand a single line of his poetry, he knew I was a reader. That was enough for him. The moment we walked in, he opened up, pouring out the accumulated thoughts of an entire year. It didn’t matter that we didn’t understand. It didn’t matter that it was Christmas Eve. It didn’t matter that salted lamb ribs, potatoes, rutabaga mash, Christmas beer, and aquavit had all been served.\n[1986-12-24 23:00:00] Sogn South Borgård Farm | His hair was disheveled, his suit crooked, his tie stained with splashes. He sat there talking nonstop, his eyes shining—truly glowing. Outside it was pitch dark, rain drumming against the windowpanes. Gifts were piled beneath the tree, everyone dressed up. Grandma shivered, Grandpa sat upright gnawing on a bone. It was in Leivik, Christmas Eve 1986, our Christmas Eve, and the only topic of conversation was Heidegger. Mom listened intently; Henrik Inge could no longer bear to hear it. I’ve never been able to forget that scene. As for me, I didn’t care about anything, especially not the joy of celebrating Christmas. But even though I couldn’t understand a single word of what Skjærtan said or wrote, and though the poetry he passionately praised remained completely foreign to me, intuitively I still believed he was right—that indeed there existed such a supreme philosophy and supreme poetry, so that even if you didn’t understand it or couldn’t take part, the fault lay entirely with yourself. From then on, whenever I thought of the supreme, I would think of Hölderlin; and whenever I thought of Hölderlin, I would see high mountains and fjords, night and rain, sky and earth—and my uncle’s shining eyes.\n[1998-02-15 20:00:00] Telemark Camp | We were spending several weeks together at a cold, abandoned camp in Telemark, watching over two wooden cabins, with a river nearby rushing swiftly beneath an arched night sky dense with stars. The odd thing was how much the language of his novels reflected—or aligned with—his character. I hadn’t figured this out the first time I met him, since that evening at the Artists’ House had been nothing but superficial talk, and even during our second, third, and fourth meetings, I still hadn’t found an answer.\n[1998-02-15 21:00:00] Telemark Camp | He was a big man, with iron fists and massive palms, pockmarked skin, and eyes unusually intense—his emotions always visible, instantly readable. In Telemark, we did so many things together—eating breakfast, hiking two kilometers to school, teaching, having dinner, drinking coffee or beer. On one hand, I deeply admired the novels he wrote; on the other, I found it difficult to talk with him—I’d open my mouth and say something foolish, utterly unworthy even to carry his shoes. But there was simply no place to hide; I had to speak.\n[1998-02-16 10:00:00] Telemark Camp | I heard him tell me that the stop before Bø was called Jålskebø, and we laughed hard for a while. I said my leather jacket wasn’t a leather jacket but a 'circumcised jacket,' and he laughed even louder. That’s all it took. His mind worked at lightning speed, everything sparking interest, igniting connections in his head and driving deeper, because his thoughts were always original, driven by a powerful hunger for the extreme—this bathed the world around him in a constant new light, a Jorgensen light, which didn’t just affect him alone, because this special quality also sparked off interactions with him, with tradition, with his reading.\n[1998-02-20 20:00:00] Telemark Camp | He handed me two sheets of paper, and I began to read. When I looked up, I happened to see him sitting there with his face hidden behind his two large hands, like a shy child. He asked if I wanted to see what he’d just written. I said yes, of course. I heard him say, 'Ah, how embarrassing. Truly mortifying.' He was kind to me, caring and guiding me, while also curious about what I might gain from this endeavor—he called it 'measuring walk'—from this journey. It was an exceptionally strong beginning: an apocalyptic explosion of dynamite in an ancient rural world, a child running out of school and into the forest. It was written with great enchantment. I felt like a little brother.\n[1998-02-20 20:10:00] Telemark Camp | I thought: What? Is he crazy?",

    "text": "[1998-07-17 14:00:00] Baysang Apartment Hallway | \"Hi,\" he said, \"it's me. I'm calling because something happened. Yeah... something's occurred...\" \"Oh?\" I said, standing in the hallway leaning one hand against the wall, the other holding the receiver. \"Dad died.\" \"Oh...\" I said. Three days earlier, around two in the afternoon, Henrik Inge had called me. From his voice I immediately sensed something was wrong; my first thought was that Dad had died.\n[1998-07-17 14:01:00] Baysang Apartment Hallway | \"Marivik just called me. Grandma found him in his chair this morning.\" \"How did he die?\" \"I don't know. Probably heart-related, I suppose.\"\n[1998-07-17 14:02:00] Baysang Apartment Hallway | There were no windows in the hallway, the ceiling light was off, and the only illumination came faintly from the kitchen at one end and the open bedroom at the other. I stared at the face in the mirror—blurry, as if gazing at me from some distant place.\n[1998-07-17 14:03:00] Baysang Apartment Hallway | \"So, what do we do now? I mean, practically speaking, what should we do?\" \"Marivik is waiting for us to fully take over. So we go directly there. Actually, the sooner the better.\" \"Okay,\" I said, \"I have to attend Borg's funeral, actually, I should leave right now. My luggage is already packed. I can set off immediately. Shall we meet there?\" \"Yes, that's settled,\" said Henrik Inge. \"Then I'll drive over tomorrow.\" \"Tomorrow?\" I said. \"Now I need to think.\"\n[1998-07-17 14:04:00] Baysang apartment hallway | \"Why don't you fly over here, and then we can drive down together?\" \"Good idea. I'll do that. I'll call you once I know which flight I'm taking. OK?\" \"OK. See you tomorrow.\"\n[1998-07-17 14:05:00] Baysang apartment kitchen | I hung up the phone, walked into the kitchen, filled the kettle with water, took a tea bag from the cupboard and placed it in a new cup, leaned tightly against the kitchen counter, and looked upward at the dead-end street running alongside the house. Through the thick, lush greenery growing at the far end of the small garden, I could faintly glimpse it appearing and disappearing like a gray patch, all the way up to the edge of the road. On the other side stood tall, sturdy deciduous trees; beneath their shade, a narrow path wound upward to the main road, where the tower of Haugesund Hospital rose high above everything. All I could think was that I couldn't bring myself to think about what I ought to be thinking about. I didn't feel I had any obligation. I thought, my father is dead—that's a big, important thing, it should completely fill my entire being—but it doesn't. Because here I am staring at the kettle waiting for it to boil, annoyed that the water hasn't heated yet. Here I stand looking outside, just as I always do when I see the garden, thinking how lucky we are to have this apartment because the elderly landlady takes care of the garden, not thinking about my father being dead, even though that's supposedly the one thing that actually matters.\n[1998-07-17 14:10:00] Baysang apartment kitchen | I pulled the string of the tea bag up and down in the water a few times, then tossed it into the sink, where it landed with a soft plop. Holding the cup, I walked into the dining room. This should be a moment of shock, I thought, pouring water into the cup even though it hadn't boiled yet. This expensive, stylish, shiny teapot was a wedding gift from Henrik Inge. The cup, this golden Höganas ceramic one—I can't remember who gave it to us, only that it was on Tone's gift wish list. Well, at least I'm alone in the apartment, thank God!\n[1998-07-17 14:15:00] Baysang apartment living room | I walked around the living room for several minutes, trying to find some meaning in my father's death, but I couldn't. His death has no meaning. I understand his death, I accept it—on one level, it isn't meaningless, a capsized boat of life is no different than before it capsized; but on another level, it's just one fact among many, and shouldn't dominate my consciousness.\n[1998-07-17 14:20:00] Baysang apartment living room | I paced around the living room holding my cup. The outdoor sky was gray and soft, the view unfolding downward, filled with rooftops and lush green gardens. I could still smell the scent of fresh paint on the walls. We had moved here only weeks ago from Volda, where Tone was studying broadcast journalism, and I had written a novel due to be published in two months. This was our first real home; the place in Volda didn’t count—it was temporary—but this felt permanent, or at least seemed so. This was our home.\n[1998-07-17 14:21:00] Baysang apartment dining room | I saw the dining room painted blood-red, crammed with too much furniture, posters, and bookshelves. It had been painted according to Tone’s mother’s suggestion—she was an artist, though she spent most of her time on interior design and cooking, both of which she excelled at. Her own home looked like something out of a decor magazine, and her meals were always exquisitely prepared and delicious. Her living room, like the rest of her house, was eggshell white. But ours looked nothing like a decor magazine—clearly showing we had only just escaped student life.\n[1998-07-17 14:22:00] Baysang apartment living room | I had finished writing the novel on a student loan, since I was still nominally enrolled in a literature studies program, but that funding would stop in July, leaving me completely broke. I’d need to request an advance from the publisher. My father died, and this timing feels like a sign—he had money, didn’t he? They—the three brothers—sold the house on Elve Street less than two years ago and split the proceeds. Could he really have squandered it all in such a short time?\n[1998-07-17 14:23:00] Baysang apartment living room | My father is dead, and I’m thinking about the money I might get from him. So what? I think what I think. Sorry, that’s just how it is. Is that okay?\n[1998-07-17 14:24:00] Baysang apartment balcony | I placed the cup on the dining table, opened the flimsy door, stepped out onto the balcony, braced my stiff hands on the railing, looked outward, and breathed in the warm summer air. Then I went back into the living room and looked around. I drew a deep breath, filling my lungs with the rich mix of scents—plants, cars, and the city. Should I eat something, drink something, go out and buy something?\n[1998-07-17 14:25:00] Baysang apartment hallway | I walked into the hallway and glanced into the bedroom, seeing the wide unmade bed and a door leading to the bathroom. I could do this, I thought—take a shower. That would be good. I’ll be heading out soon anyway.\n[1998-07-17 14:26:00] Baysang apartment bathroom | I took off my clothes and stood under the running water. Steam rose around my head, heat spreading down my body, enveloping me completely. Should I jerk off? No, damn it, Dad is dead. Dead, dead, Dad is dead. Dead, dead, Dad is dead.\n[1998-07-17 14:30:00] Baysang apartment kitchen | I turned off the faucet, dried myself with a large towel, applied some deodorant under my arms, got dressed, and walked into the kitchen to check the time, rubbing my hair with a small towel. Two thirty. Standing under hot water has become meaningless.\n[1998-07-17 14:31:00] Baysang apartment hallway | Then I walked into the hallway, tossed the towel into the open bathroom, picked up the phone, and dialed her number. She answered immediately. Toneie will be home in another hour. When she walks through that door, going through all this again from the beginning—I can't even bear to think about it.\n[1998-07-17 14:32:00] Baysang apartment hallway | \"It's Toneie.\" \"Hi, Toneie, it's me,\" I said. \"How are you doing, okay?\" \"Fine. Actually, I'm editing right now—just came by the office to pick something up. Once I finish what I'm working on, I'll come home.\" \"Okay,\" I said. \"What are you doing?\" she asked. \"Nothing much,\" I said. \"Henrik Inge called. Dad died.\" \"What? He died?\" \"Yes.\"\n[1998-07-17 14:33:00] Baysang apartment hallway | \"Oh, how awful! Oh, Grete Lundnes...\" \"It's okay,\" I said. \"Actually, it was expected. But I still have to go over tonight. First to Henrik Inge's, then early tomorrow morning we'll drive over.\" \"Do you want me to come with you? I could.\" \"No, no need. You have work! Stay here, then come to the funeral.\"\n[1998-07-17 14:34:00] Baysang apartment hallway | \"Oh, how terrible,\" she said again. \"I could let someone else take over the editing. Then I'll come home right away. When are you leaving?\" \"No rush,\" I said. \"I'll leave in a few hours. It's fine to be alone for a while.\" \"Sure?\" \"Yes, yes. Absolutely sure. To be honest, I don't feel anything. We've talked about this for so long—if he kept going like that, it was only a matter of time before he died. So I've been prepared.\" \"Alright,\" Toneie said, \"then I'll finish up here and come home as soon as possible. Take care of yourself. I love you.\" \"I love you too,\" I said.\n[1998-07-17 14:35:00] Baysang apartment hallway | I picked up the receiver again and dialed Henrik Inge's number. When I hung up, I thought of Mom. She should know too. He must have already told her everything.",

    "text": "[1998-07-17 15:30:00] Baysang apartment living room | Sitting fully dressed in the living room waiting, I heard Toneie arrive at the door. She rushed into the apartment like a gust of summer wind—so fresh, so full of life. I stood up. Her movements were slightly flustered, her eyes filled with concern. She hugged me, saying she wanted to come with me, but I was right—it was better she stayed. Then I called a taxi, and together we stood on the steps outside, waiting. Five minutes later, the car arrived. We're married, I thought. We're husband and wife. My wife stands outside waving goodbye to me as I leave—and I smiled. Where did that image come from? Are we just pretending to be husband and wife? Aren't we really married?\n[1998-07-17 15:35:00] Outside Baysang apartment | I squeezed her hand. \"What are you smiling about?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"Just thinking about something.\" \"The car's here,\" she said.\n[1998-07-17 15:36:00] Outside Baysang apartment | I looked toward the row of houses in the distance. Something black—like a car starting up—was slowly crawling up the slope. At the intersection, the car paused, hesitated, then cautiously continued climbing upward to the right, along the street that shared the same name as where we were standing. \"Should I call him?\" Toneie said. \"No, why? I can do it myself just as well.\"\n[1998-07-17 15:37:00] Baysang intersection | I picked up my suitcase and walked up the steps leading to the road. Tonje followed behind. We kissed each other goodbye, and as I turned toward the intersection, a taxi was backing down the slope, and she waved her hand. When I opened the door and leaned my head into the car, the driver spoke. \"I'm going to the intersection,\" I said. \"I'll get in there. I'll call you tonight. Okay?\" \"Grete Lundnes?\" \"Yes, that's me,\" I said. \"To Flesland Airport.\" \"Get in, I'll take your suitcase.\"\n[1998-07-17 15:40:00] Inside the taxi | I hunched into the back seat and then sat upright. Taxis—I love taxis. Not riding home drunk, but traveling—sitting in one on the way to the airport or train station. Can you find anything more exciting than sitting in the back of a taxi as it carries you through town and countryside to some destination?\n[1998-07-17 15:45:00] Inside the taxi | When the driver got in, he spoke. He smiled at me in the mirror. \"The roads around here are hard to find,\" he said. \"I've heard about this place—roads with branches—but I've never been here myself. Not in twenty years. That's kind of strange.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I guess now I've been everywhere. I suppose this must be the last road I hadn't traveled.\" \"Going on vacation?\"\n[1998-07-17 15:46:00] Inside the taxi | \"No,\" I said, \"not at all. My father died today. I'm going to bury him. In Vesfjord.\"\n[1998-07-17 15:50:00] Inside the taxi | The brief conversation ended there. I sat motionless, gazing out the window at the houses passing by, not thinking particularly about anything, just watching. Munde, Fantoft Church, Hop. Gas station, auto shop, supermarket, detached housing, forest, stream, construction site.\n[1998-07-17 16:10:00] Inside the taxi | I took out my bank card from the inner pocket of my jacket and leaned forward to read the number on the meter in front. As we entered the final stretch, I could see the control tower of the airport. Three hundred twenty kroner. So it would have been smarter not to take a taxi at all—taking the bus here would have cost only a tenth of this. Now what I lack is exactly that amount of money.\n[1998-07-17 16:15:00] Flesland Airport entrance | I handed him the card. He passed me the receipt, along with a pen and a thick cardboard sheet. I signed it, and he tore off a new receipt for me. \"Could I get a receipt for three hundred fifty kroner?\" I said. \"Sure, of course,\" he said, grabbing the card from my hand. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"Thanks,\" I said. \"I'll get my luggage myself.\" He punched in the number from the meter, and immediately the receipt snapped out.\n[1998-07-17 16:20:00] Flesland Airport waiting room | Although the suitcase was heavy, I carried it myself into the waiting room. I hate those little-wheeled trolleys because first of all they're feminine, which doesn't suit a real man—a man should carry things himself, not push a cart. The second reason is that they represent convenience, speed, effortlessness, and efficiency—all of which I despise. I prefer to do everything myself whenever possible, even if it's something trivial like this. Why don't people in this world feel the gravity of the Earth? Are we living inside pictures? People save their strength—but what exactly are we saving it for?\n[1998-07-17 16:25:00] Flesland Airport waiting room | I placed the suitcase in the center of the floor in the small waiting room and looked up at the flight departure board. There was a flight to Zhenpine at five o'clock—I could easily make it. But there was another one at six. Because I enjoy sitting in airports—even more than sitting in taxis—I decided to take the later flight.\n[1998-07-17 16:30:00] Flesland Airport waiting room | I turned my head toward the check-in gate. I bought my ticket, checked in, and slowly walked toward the public phone on the far wall to call Henrik Inge. He answered immediately. Except for the three at the very end, it looked chaotic there, with long lines and mostly large suitcases. Only a few scattered people were in front of the check-in counter where I stood. I didn't resemble any of these travelers, who were almost uniformly cheerful and jubilant, brimming with excitement, just short of looking for a place to raise a toast—clearly revealing they were boarding a charter flight to the south.\n[1998-07-17 16:35:00] Flesland Airport public phone | \"Hi, it's me, Grete Lundnes,\" I said. \"The quarter-to-six flight. So I'll arrive in Sula at quarter to seven. Will you pick me up at the airport, or...?\" \"I'll pick you up.\" \"Any new news?\" \"No... I called Marivik to say we're coming. He doesn't know anything more either. I think we can set off early tomorrow morning, so we'll have time to stop by the funeral home before it closes. Tomorrow is Saturday, after all.\" \"Okay,\" I said, \"that sounds good. See you later then.\" \"Alright, goodbye.\"\n[1998-07-17 16:40:00] Flesland Airport café | I hung up the receiver and walked upstairs to the café, bought a coffee and a newspaper, found a table from where I could look down over the hall below, hung my jacket over the back of the chair, scanned the surroundings to see if there was anyone I recognized, then sat down.\n[1998-07-17 16:45:00] Flesland Airport café | Ever since that spring when he split up with Mom, his life had moved steadily toward one direction only. We didn’t understand it then, but at some crossroads in time he crossed a line, and from that moment on we knew he might do something—something terrible—at any moment. Thoughts about Dad kept circling through my mind ever since Henrik Inge called me, yet without emotional charge, always like a clear, detached confirmation. That was enough, because I had long been prepared for this. Maybe it was even a good thing, depending on how you looked at it. For a long time I had wished for his death, ever since I realized his life might end soon—I began hoping for it. Whenever the TV reported fatal accidents in the area where he lived—fires, car crashes, bodies found in forests or at sea—I immediately felt a flicker of hope: maybe it was Dad. But it never was. He stayed alive. He just kept going.\n[1998-07-17 16:50:00] Flesland Airport café | Watching people walking around in the hall below. Now moving about down there are people pulling wheeled suitcases, carrying plastic bags from duty-free shops, clutching their wallets and bank cards, their armpits perfumed, their glasses, their dyed hair, their walkers. Until now, I suppose. A third of them will be dead in twenty-five years, two-thirds in fifty, and in a hundred years they’ll all be gone. And what happens afterward—what value does life hold then? Just mouths gaping open, empty black holes for eye sockets, lying deep beneath the soil? Perhaps Judgment Day really will come. Across thousands of years, all these skeletons and skulls will be dug up by those living on Earth then, clattering as they’re pieced together, the bony frames rising up, grinning toward the sun, while God, surrounded by angels on the walls above and below, the ruler of heaven, will pass judgment. The earth lush and vast, rich and wide, the holy trumpets sounding, all plains and valleys, all beaches and fields, all oceans and rivers—these dead shall rise and walk toward the almighty divine, lifted up before God. Those with heavy, devilish hearts will be cast down into a burning hell; those with light, good hearts will be led up into a radiant heaven. All these people too will be awakened from their sleep, no different from those who died in the Middle Ages or the Stone Age—no distinction possible, they are all dead, and the dead shall be judged on the Last Day.\n[1998-07-17 16:52:00] Flesland Airport café | I placed my smoldering cigarette in the ashtray, took a sip of coffee, and kept my eyes on them. Over by the luggage conveyor belt at the back of the hall, a group of Japanese people approached—perhaps twenty of them. They seemed foreign—not because of their clothes or appearance, but because of their mannerisms—and fascinating. To live in Japan, surrounded by strangers, seeing everything but not understanding, perhaps guessing its meaning but never quite certain—that has long been my dream. Sitting in a traditional Japanese house, Spartan in its simplicity, with sliding doors and paper walls—this feels utterly distant from myself and my Nordic restlessness, which is precisely why it seems dreamlike. Sitting there writing a novel, observing the world slowly, carefully shaping what flows from my hands, because thought naturally ties closely to the concrete environment we inhabit, just as much as our conversations with others and the books we read.\n[1998-07-17 17:00:00] Flesland Airport café | Once he suddenly disappeared, as if he’d vanished underground for several weeks. Marivik called Henrik Inge directly to report that he had filed a missing person’s report with the police. When he saw him again, it was in a hospital somewhere in the south—he was lying there, unable to walk. It was temporary, not permanent paralysis. He recovered, stood up again, spent a few weeks in a clinic for alcohol addiction treatment, and then returned to being as he was before. During that time, I didn’t contact him. But he started visiting Grandma more and more frequently, staying longer each time. Eventually he moved in and shut himself away. He gathered everything he still had and stored it in the garage. By then Marivik had arranged home care for Grandma, who struggled to live alone, but Dad drove the caregiver away and locked the door. Until his death, he remained living there with her.\n[1998-07-17 17:01:00] Flesland Airport café | Marivik once mentioned incidentally during a phone call to Henrik Inge what had happened there. One time, he went to visit them and found Dad lying on the floor in the living room. His leg was broken, but he wouldn’t let Grandma call an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Instead, he threatened her not to tell anyone, not even Marivik. So he lay there, surrounded by plates with leftover food, beer bottles, wine glasses, and the liquor she brought him from his large stockpile. How long he lay there, Marivik didn’t know—perhaps a day, perhaps two. He called Henrik Inge to tell him, realizing things couldn’t go on like this. He believed the only solution was for us to intervene, to take Dad out of there, because otherwise he would die. We discussed it, but decided to leave him be. He was sailing his own sea, living his own life, and dying his own death.\n[1998-07-17 17:02:00] Flesland Airport café | I think he’s done it now.\n[1998-07-17 17:15:00] Flesland Airport café | I sat there staring at the small airplane suspended beneath the huge glass ceiling, daylight gathering upon it, then glanced at the departure board, where the clock showed it was now quarter past five, then lowered my gaze to the people below—those grouped in lines, walking across the floor, sitting reading newspapers, standing talking. It was summer, and the people below were dressed lightly and brightly, with tanned skin, voices cheerful and relaxed—the way people always are when gathered for travel. My mouth was dry, my heart beating fast beneath my chest, as if I were excited, but I wasn’t excited. On the contrary, I felt calm and heavy. Sometimes I had sat among them just like this, able to feel bright colors, sharp lines, faces with distinct features. That was storage of meaning. Without such meaning, as now in my relation to them, everything felt distant, blurred in a certain way, impossible to grasp or feel—like shadows without darkness, merely a gray haze.\n[1998-07-17 17:20:00] Flesland Airport café | I stood up and walked toward the counter to refill my coffee. I saw a man standing there wearing a dark, high-quality, tastefully tailored suit, a silk scarf around his neck, dandruff on his shoulders. As I approached, he was about to pour coffee. He held a white cup on a red tray, a full pot of black coffee in hand, and raised his eyes to mine with a questioning look as he lifted the pot slightly. Then he set the pot back onto one of the two burners. I said, \"Thanks, I'll do it myself.\" He said, \"By all means.\"\n[1998-07-17 17:20:00] Flesland Airport Cafe | I turned around to look toward the exit. A group of passengers, who must have just arrived, were walking up from the plane through a tunnel-like jet bridge. The door at the gate opened, and the travelers came in, raising their heads to search for signs displaying baggage carousel numbers, continued forward to the right, and then disappeared. A folded coat draped over my arm, handbags and plastic bags brushing against my thighs.\n[1998-07-17 17:22:00] Flesland Airport Cafe | The waitress, a large woman somewhere between fifty and sixty, I held out my cup so she could see there was still coffee in it. I placed five kroner in her hand and returned to my table. I said, \"Another cup of coffee.\" She said, \"Five kroner,\" with a crisp Baysang accent. I suppose he's the kind of academic type. This woman is definitely from Baysang—after living in that city for eight years, I'd seen such faces everywhere: on buses, on the streets, behind counters in shops—all with short, dyed hair and square glasses suited only to that age group.\n[1998-07-17 17:35:00] Flesland Airport Cafe | He said something, and both laughed loudly; as they walked toward the table, he must have repeated it, because the people sitting there also laughed. Two boys walked past me, each carrying a paper bag of cola and holding ice pops. One had visible facial hair on his lips and chin, probably about fifteen. The other was smaller, clean-shaven with a smooth face—you couldn't assume he was younger just because of that. The older one had thick lips that wouldn't quite close, and an empty stare that made him look stupid. The smaller one had lively eyes, the alertness typical of a twelve-year-old. I wonder how old they really are. I can't imagine ever having been as young as fourteen or fifteen myself. But I must have been.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 17:45:00] Grandmother's Living Room | She held her face in her hands for a moment. Then she quickly walked back into the kitchen. I think this makes no sense at all. It's unsolvable. I could bring a bucket and clean, scrub this damn whole house from top to bottom, but it would be useless. The idea that we could take over this house and hold the funeral gathering here is equally pointless. I can't find any helpful solution, I have nowhere to run, and no one can save me.\n[1998-07-18 17:47:00] Grandmother's Balcony | I nodded, followed him down into the other living room, then outside onto the balcony. Henrik Inge stood there gripping the balcony railing, gazing out over the bay. I sat down on the sun-faded lounge chair, then immediately got up again, gathered the bottles lying around, piled them together along the wall, looked around for a bag, but saw none. \"You're thinking the same thing I am, aren't you?\" Henrik Inge said, finally straightening up. \"I think so,\" I said. \"We need to talk together,\" Henrik Inge said. \"Shall we go out onto the balcony?\" Not a breath of wind. The sky remained the same gray, but there was a hint of light above the city. Down in the narrow alley below the house, a car was driving upward, its engine humming low.\n[1998-07-18 17:49:00] Grandmother's Balcony | He said, \"Only Grandmother saw him. She's the only witness we have. Marivik didn't see him. She called him in the morning; he called the ambulance. But he never saw him.\" I said, \"Right.\" He said, \"All we know is that he might still be alive. How could Grandmother understand that? She found him on the sofa, spoke to him, got no answer, called Marivik, then the ambulance came, the house filled with doctors and paramedics, they carried him away on a stretcher, and disappeared—that's all that happened. But did anyone consider that he wasn't dead? That he was merely dead drunk? Or in shock?\" I said, \"Yeah, when we arrived, she said she found him in the morning. Now she says it was in the evening. Just look at that.\"\n[1998-07-18 17:51:00] Grandmother's Balcony | I paced back and forth along the balcony railing, stopped to peer through the window to see if Grandmother was there, then turned toward Henrik Inge, who now stood with his hands folded on the railing, staring at the horizon. \"She's starting to lose her memory. She keeps asking the same thing over and over. How much did she really understand when the place was full of those emergency workers?\" \"It's those damn drugs they gave her,\" I said. \"Yes.\" \"We have to clarify this,\" I said, \"I mean, just to be safe.\" \"Jesus, God, the thought that he might still be alive,\" Henrik Inge said. A fear I'd never known before filled me completely. The logic was clear and undeniable. The only one who saw Father was Grandmother. All we have is her testimony—and she's so confused, so utterly disoriented, there's no reason to believe everything she says is true. When Marivik arrived, everything here was already over—the ambulance had taken him away, and afterward no one contacted the hospital or the staff who'd been here. The funeral home doesn't even know yet. It's been barely more than a day since she found him. In that time, he could have been lying in a hospital.\n[1998-07-18 17:54:00] Grandmother's Balcony | We went inside. I closed the door and followed Henrik Inge up to the dining room on the second floor, then into the kitchen. Henrik Inge and I exchanged glances. I turned and walked into the living room, toward the door leading to the balcony, ready to step outside, run across the lawn, into town, and never come back. I held myself back, standing quietly still. I stepped back, and saw Marivik walk past, entering the kitchen. I said, \"Should we call Marivik?\" Henrik Inge turned to me and said, \"He doesn't know any more than we do.\" I said, \"Let's talk to Grandmother again, maybe call the funeral home. He should sort this out.\" \"That's what I'm thinking too,\" Henrik Inge said. \"Will you call?\" \"I can do it,\" I said. Grandmother said, \"Who could that be?\" A sudden gust of wind lifted the curtain hanging by the door high into the air, flapping it into the room. The front door downstairs slammed shut. Footsteps on the stairs. It's Father—I know it. Damn it, God damn it, now he's coming. I felt a terror unlike anything I'd ever experienced. The footsteps twisted slightly as they reached the turn of the stairs. They climbed the final steps and entered the living room. He must be furious. What the hell are we doing, rummaging through his things like this, barging into his life? Of course—it's definitely Marivik.\n[1998-07-18 17:55:00] Grandmother's Kitchen | He said and walked in. I went upstairs to join them. They were seated around the kitchen table. He said, \"I see you've already done some of the work.\" Marivik said, \"I think I can make a trip to the dump this afternoon—it's on the way to the holiday cabin. Then tomorrow morning I'll bring the trailer back and help you a bit more. The pile of junk in front of the garage is almost enough to fill a load.\" \"I think so too,\" Henrik Inge said. \"We can fill a few more bags,\" Marivik said, \"clothes from his room and things like that.\" He stood up. \"Well, let's get started right away. Won't take long.\" He paused in the living room, looking inside. \"We can take out the clothes right now, what do you say? So you won't have to keep seeing them here... gives you the creeps...\"\n[1998-07-18 17:57:00] Grandmother's Living Room | I put on the yellow gloves and walked inside, stuffing everything piled on the sofa into a black garbage bag. I closed my eyes as I grabbed the dried feces in my hands. I did as he said, carried them down the stairs, out the door to the front of the house, and threw them into the trailer. I said, \"I can take them away, I think—better wear gloves.\" Marivik said, \"Take the pillows too, and the blanket over there. They don't look dirty either.\"\n[1998-07-18 18:05:00] outside grandmother's house | Henrik Inge also brought a bag, and we began tossing the garbage bags piled up there one by one into the car. The trailer quickly filled up, and he and Henrik Inge repeated the procedure of driving forward and backing up again, until Marivik’s car stopped with its rear end facing the trailer, ready to hook onto it. After he drove the car away, Henrik Inge parked the car in front of the garage, and I sat down on the steps. Henrik Inge leaned against the doorframe. Marivik’s car was parked on the other side, which was why we hadn’t heard the engine roar. Beads of sweat glistened on his forehead.\n[1998-07-18 18:07:00] outside grandmother's house | After a while he said, 'I’m sure it was Dad who came up the stairs.' I said, 'Me too.'\n[1998-07-18 18:08:00] outside grandmother's house | Henrik Inge said, 'He’s definitely dead. He’s dead. But we need to be certain. I’m going to make this call.' A magpie flew down from the roof at the far end of the garden, gliding smoothly through the air above us. It flapped its wings a few times and let out a cry, as if trying to learn how to vocalize—its sound strangely unreal.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 18:09:00] second floor of grandmother's house | Followed him up to the second floor. I said, 'Look, all we’ve got about this is Grandmother’s word. This house has always had too much drunkenness and misery—he could easily just be passed out drunk. That’s probably exactly what happened. The worst thing you fear is what comes true, right? And here we are doing this—snooping around, going through his things—while he might actually be back? But she said… How could she have found him in the morning and then again in the evening? How can those two things fit together?' Henrik Inge looked at me and said, 'Maybe he died in the evening. But she thought he was just sleeping. Then she found him in the morning. That’s one possibility. She’s tormented by guilt so she can’t admit it. So she made up that he died in the morning.' I said, 'Yeah, that’s possible.' Henrik Inge said, 'But the crucial question hasn’t changed. I’ll go upstairs and make the call.' I said, 'I’m coming too.'\n[1998-07-18 18:11:00] second floor of grandmother's house | While he searched his wallet for the funeral director’s business card, I closed the door leading to the kitchen and went down into the second living room. Henrik Inge was dialing. 'Hi, it’s me, Henrik Inge Grete Lundnes. We were at your place this morning, if you remember…? Yes, that’s right. Now we’d like to know… Yes, whether you know where he is? You see, things here are a bit unclear… The only person present at the scene was our grandmother. She’s quite old and not always mentally clear—well, in short, we don’t fully know what happened. Could you look into this for us?... Yes... Yes... Yes. Great. Thank you... Really appreciate it. Okay... Goodbye.' Grandmother is sitting in there, so better be careful. I could hardly bear listening to their conversation, yet I couldn’t help but want to hear.\n[1998-07-18 18:14:00] second floor of grandmother's house | When Henrik Inge put down the receiver, he looked down at me. 'He’s at the holiday cabin. But he said he’ll make a few calls to clarify things, and later he’ll phone us back.' 'Okay,' I said.\n[1998-07-18 18:16:00] grandmother's living room | I went into the kitchen, filled a bucket with water, poured in some green soap, found a rag, and walked into the living room. I stood there for a moment. I had absolutely no idea where to begin. Cleaning the floor now would be pointless—we’re just going to throw out the furniture anyway, and over the next few days we’ll be walking all over it. Wiping window frames, doorframes, doors, baseboards, bookshelves, tables, and chairs—those are all small, trivial tasks. I wanted to do something that would actually help, something effective.\n[1998-07-18 18:18:00] grandmother's living room | I turned my head. I heard Grandmother getting up inside. I called loudly to Henrik Inge in the kitchen, 'Did you see? There’s a huge seagull standing outside the window, pecking at the glass with its beak.' She said, 'We need to find something for it to eat.' I sensed something swoosh past on my left—a massive seagull stood outside the window, looking in. It tapped the glass twice with its sharp beak, then stood still.\n[1998-07-18 18:19:00] grandmother's balcony | I walked toward the open door. Henrik Inge was emptying the cupboard contents, piling glasses and dinner plates onto the countertop below. Grandmother stood beside him. I stood in the doorway, watching how the bird pecked at the meat pieces, jerking its head back when it caught a large bite. I said, 'Did you see the seagull?' 'No,' said Henrik Inge, 'I never pay attention to seagulls.' He laughed. 'It always comes here,' said Grandmother, 'It wants food. That’s all. It gets food here.' 'Are you sure it’s the same seagull?' 'Yes, definitely. I recognize it. It recognizes me too.' She placed a piece of meatloaf on a small plate, hunched over, her bony frame standing there, a strand of black hair hanging down over her eyes. Half the meat chunk was already covered in congealed sauce. She cut it into pieces quickly. When she opened the balcony door, the seagull jumped onto the floor and walked straight to the dish without any fear. Grandmother stood beside it, gazing at the sky above the distant city. 'Yes, that’s right,' she said. My eyes followed her moving through the living room.\n[1998-07-18 18:20:00] grandmother's living room | I stepped back a little so I could see the phone and confirm whether Henrik Inge had answered it. I watched it glide steadily out toward the sea. Henrik Inge stopped behind me. I closed the door and turned to face him. He said, 'He’s definitely dead. He’s lying in the basement of the hospital. We can see him Monday morning, if we want to. Also, I got the phone number of the doctor who came here.' I said, 'I need to see it with my own eyes.' He said, 'Then we’ll go see him.' The phone inside rang. Grandmother walked past me. The seagull jumped onto the railing, stood there for a few seconds, then launched itself forward, flapping its great wings. It soared high above the lawn. The conversation was very brief.\n[1998-07-18 18:30:00] Grandmother's bathroom | Ten minutes later, I placed a bucket filled with steaming hot water, a bottle of Clorin, and a bottle of Jif cleaner on the floor outside the bathroom. I took the garbage bag I had brought, shook it a few times in my hand to open it wide, then began emptying everything out of the bathroom. First, the things on the floor: used-up dry soap, greasy shampoo bottles, cardboard toilet paper rolls, a grimy bath brush with brown stains, aluminum foil and plastic pill packaging, some loose pills, a few socks, and several curlers. After clearing these, I started emptying everything from the wall cabinet, except for two small bottles of what looked like expensive perfume. Razor blades, razors, hairpins, more soap, old dried-up moisturizers and ointments, a hairnet, aftershave, deodorant, eyeliner, lipstick, a few cracked powder puffs whose purpose I didn’t know—probably makeup-related—hairs, some short and curly, others long and straight, a nail clipper, a roll of plastic, dental floss, combs. Once I’d emptied everything, a thick layer of yellowish-brown grime remained on the shelves. I decided to clean that last. The tiles beside the toilet, where the toilet paper roll hung, were covered in brown stains, and the floor beneath was sticky. This was my top priority. I sprayed Jif cleaner onto the tiles and began scrubbing methodically, systematically—from the ceiling down to the floor, first the right wall, then the wall next to the mirror, then along the bathtub, finally the wall by the door. I cleaned every single tile thoroughly. This entire process took an hour and a half.\n[1998-07-18 19:00:00] Grandmother's bathroom | He had been suffering from severe internal bleeding for a long time, which he discovered only when he went to the hospital. Within days, he would die, as there was almost no blood left in his body. He must have known something was wrong inside him, but he must have refused to see a doctor. Then he collapsed on the bathroom floor, nearly dying. Though he was rushed to the hospital in time and revived during the critical moments, the damage to his body was too great. He gradually weakened and deteriorated until death finally came. Sometimes I wonder if Grandfather fell here, six years ago, one autumn night, calling out to Grandmother, who called the ambulance, who sat here holding his hand until the paramedics arrived. This is the first time I truly realized that everything here had remained unchanged until that moment arrived.\n[1998-07-18 19:30:00] Grandmother's bathroom | A water tank, probably from the 1950s, metal-cased with a small black ball on the side, always standing upright. Whenever someone used water, it made a rustling sound from deep within its dark interior. The first floor was unused, empty, with blue, clean wall-to-wall carpeting. In the closet, women’s coats and men’s overcoats hung neatly. On the hat shelf sat Grandmother’s and Grandfather’s hats. Their shoes stood on the shoe rack. When I was a child, I was deeply afraid of coming into this downstairs bathroom. In my imagination, all these objects represented a crowd of people. Back then, they loomed over me everywhere—the staircase gaping upward toward the second floor always terrified me with its strange power. I had to gather all my willpower just to overcome this fear and enter the bathroom. I knew there was nothing inside, I knew the rustling was just water, the coats were just coats, the shoes were just shoes, the stairs were just stairs—but perhaps precisely because I knew this so clearly, my fear intensified. I simply did not want to be alone with these things. That was why I was afraid—these lifeless, inanimate objects stirred deeper fear in my heart. I would continue to experience the world through this attitude. The toilet lid seemed alive, so did the sink, the bathtub, and this black garbage bag standing greedily on the floor. And yet tonight, that discomfort returned, because Grandfather had fallen here, because Father died yesterday in the living room upstairs—so now the dead objects became entangled with the dead themselves, my father and grandfather. How could I possibly untangle this feeling? Well, only through cleaning. Scrub after scrub, wipe after wipe. Watching each tile become clean and shiny. Imagining how everything ruined here would regain its luster, all of it, every single thing. Under no circumstances would I end where he ended.\n[1998-07-18 20:00:00] Grandmother's bathroom | After scrubbing the walls and floor, I poured water into the toilet, flushed it, then peeled off the yellow gloves and draped them over the edge of the red empty bucket. I opened the door and went in. Ah, there it was—a toilet brush. Now I’ll use this one, whatever condition it’s in; I’ll buy a new one on Monday. I walked halfway across the floor toward the stairs and stopped. At the same time, I thought I should remember to buy a toilet brush as soon as possible. In case the other bathroom doesn’t have one either.\n[1998-07-18 20:02:00] Grandmother's bedroom | The door to Grandmother’s bedroom was slightly ajar. For some reason, I walked over, pushed it open, and peered inside. The mattress on her bed had no sheet; she slept directly on the rough surface, which was stained all over with yellow urine spots. Beside the bed stood a chair resembling a toilet seat, with a bucket underneath. Clothes were scattered everywhere on the floor. A row of potted plants lined the windowsill. A sharp smell of ammonia stung my nostrils. Oh my God. It stinks like hell in here. What disgusting shit, damn it, fucking damn it.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 20:05:00] Grandmother's living room | I opened the door just as before, leaving a small gap, and slowly climbed the stairs to the second floor. In places, the banister was almost black with grime. I put my hand on it and felt its stickiness. As I stepped onto the final stair, I heard the sound of the television. I entered the living room. Grandmother sat in the center of the floor on a chair, staring at the TV. She was watching the news on Channel Two. How can she sit on that chair right next to where a man has just died? My abdomen tightened, tears streamed down uncontrollably, I couldn’t control the twisting of my facial muscles, found myself utterly unable to suppress the reflex to vomit, that unbalanced, asymmetrical sensation crushed me nearly into panic, as if I were torn apart. If I could, I would drop to my knees, clasp my hands together, and cry out to God, call and call—but I cannot do that. There is no mercy here. The worst has already happened. And it is over.\n[1998-07-18 20:10:00] Grandmother's kitchen | When I walked into the kitchen, it had already been cleared out. All the cabinets had been washed. Though many things still remained, the walls, floor, drawers, tables, and chairs looked much fresher. On the countertop sat a half-liter plastic bottle of beer. Fine droplets of condensation obscured the label. Next to it lay brown cheese, a cheese scraper resting on top, yellow cheese, and a carton of cream. A butter knife lay diagonally beneath, its handle slightly overhanging the table edge. The cutting board was pulled out, with a piece of knekkebrød bread on it, half still inside its red-and-white paper bag. In front of it lay the bread knife, bread crusts, and butter.\n[1998-07-18 20:12:00] Grandmother's balcony | I pulled a plastic bag from the bottom drawer, dumped the full ashtrays from the table into it, tied the bag shut, and tossed it into the black garbage bag squatting in the corner, already half-filled. I fetched a cloth, wiped the table clean of ash and greasy smears, moved her tobacco tin and cigarette roller to the other end of the table, placing them atop the box of rolling papers just below the window frame, then casually opened the glass window and secured it with the latch. Then I went to see where Henrik Inge was. He was sitting outside on the balcony, just as I expected. One hand held a beer bottle, the other a cigarette.\n[1998-07-18 20:14:00] Grandmother's balcony | I lit a cigarette and leaned against the balcony railing. 'What should we do about the garden?' I said. Henrik Inge shrugged. 'We can't finish everything here, you and me.' 'I want to,' I said. 'Really?' 'Yes.' 'Want one?' he said when I came out. 'There's a beer on the kitchen counter.' 'No thanks,' I said. 'I won't take anything from here ever again. I'll never drink beer from a plastic bottle again.' He looked at me and laughed. 'You're too sensitive,' he said. 'That bottle hasn't been opened. It was in the fridge. He never drank it. It's nothing like what you're thinking.'\n[1998-07-18 20:15:00] Grandmother's balcony | Now I considered telling him my entire plan. But I didn’t let the words come out. I knew the moment this opposing opinion emerged, Henrik Inge would propose a counterplan—one I neither wanted to hear nor participate in. Yes, they’re small things, trivial details. But has there ever been a single decision in my life? When we were children, I admired Henrik Inge, the way younger brothers admire their older ones. No one knew him better than I did, even though we rarely met outside due to our age difference—yet at home, we were together. Not out of any sense of equality, of course; naturally, things usually followed his will, but still, it was close enough. Also because we stood together against a common enemy: Father.\n[1998-07-18 20:16:00] Ålesund | I can't remember many details from childhood clearly, but they keep recurring, over and over again. How could we laugh so wildly over something so small, like that summer tent camping trip in Ålesund in 1976? It was unexpectedly hot, and one night while walking along a slope near our campsite, a car passed us. Henrik Inge said the two people inside were kissing, but I misheard it as them 'urinating.' We stood there bursting into laughter that lasted for several full minutes, our voices twice as loud as usual. For the rest of the night, at the slightest provocation, the laughter would erupt all over again.\n[1998-07-18 20:16:10] Ålesund\n[1998-07-18 20:16:20] Tjømebyen | The days when such incidents happened are countless; the bond between us is unbreakable. He could be harsher with me than with anyone else, but that didn’t change our relationship. He knew exactly what to say to make me lose my temper completely. He would sit there quietly, a teasing, mocking smile on his face, and instantly my head would burn up, everything turning black before my eyes—literally, I couldn’t see straight, had no idea what to do, completely at a loss. I might hurl the cup in my hand at him, or a slice of bread if that’s what I was holding, or an orange; if I didn’t rush at him and punch wildly, I’d just stand trembling with tears welling up. Then he would soften, take it all back, grip my hand tightly, and say, 'There, there, little one, now you're angry, poor little thing...' He also knew every single thing I feared. So when Mom was on night shift and Dad was at the municipal council meeting, and the TV was rebroadcasting *The Intruder*, a series deliberately aired late at night so kids our age wouldn’t watch it, it was the easiest thing in the world for him: turn off all the lights in the house, lock the front door, turn to me and say, 'I’m not Henrik Inge—I’m an intruder.' I would immediately scream in terror, begging him to say he was Henrik Inge: 'Say it, say it—you are Henrik Inge, I know you are, Henrik Inge, Henrik Inge, you’re not some intruder, you’re Henrik Inge...' He also knew another fear of mine—the sound from the pipes when turning on the hot water tap: first a sharp, screeching noise, then heavy thudding knocks. To me, the only possible response was to flee. So we made a pact: every morning after he washed his face at the sink, he wouldn’t drain the water—he’d leave it for me. For perhaps half a year, every morning I washed my face and hands in Henrik Inge’s leftover washwater. This was a kind of belonging. In the environment we lived in, I could never feel hatred toward him—it was more like a stream flowing into the sea, a beam of light in the darkness.\n[1998-07-18 20:16:30] Baysang | He moved out of home when he was seventeen, and naturally our relationship changed. With his daily presence gone, his image and way of life grew much larger in my mind, especially during the time he spent in Baysang, slowly beginning his studies there. He had walked this path, and I wanted to walk it too. That autumn, when I started high school, I visited him at the Alek student dormitory where he had a room. After getting off the airport shuttle into the city center, the first thing I did was find a newsstand and buy a pack of Prince cigarettes and a lighter. I had never smoked before, but I’d long planned to do so one day... So there I stood beneath the green spire of St. Helen Ster Church, the city market square stretching before me, crowded with people and vehicles, glass surfaces glinting in the sun. The sky was bright blue. My backpack rested on the sidewalk beside me. I placed the cigarette between my lips, shielded the wind with my hand, and lit it with the yellow lighter... I coughed—the smoke tore at my throat—but even after this initiation, nothing diminished the sense of freedom. When I finished, I slipped the red-and-white cigarette pack into my jacket pocket, swung my backpack onto my shoulder, and went to meet Henrik Inge. I thought: being alone in Baysang, this kind of moment becomes possible. I stood there... overwhelmed by an intense, almost irresistible feeling of freedom. I was alone, free to do whatever I wanted. My whole life lay open before me.\n[1998-07-18 20:16:40] Baysang | I walked up and down... turned to Henrik Inge... he stood leaning... I sat... collected bottles... At Vesfjord High School, nothing truly belonged to me—but Henrik Inge did, and through him, I had access to what he had. So it wasn’t just happiness I felt, but pride too, when an hour later I knelt on the floor of his room, flipping through the records he’d collected in three wine crates against the wall, sunlight streaming in through the window vents. That evening we went out with three girls he knew. I borrowed his old Spice deodorant, his hair gel. Before leaving, we stood in front of the hallway mirror—he rolled up the sleeves of my black-and-white checkered shirt, just like Bono from U2 often wore in photos, and straightened my suit collar. We met the girls at one of their apartments. They were great fun. At sixteen, I was considered old enough to enter places restricted to those eighteen and over when we passed the doorman. The next day we went to Opera Café and Gallery Café, where we also met Mom. She lived with her aunt Helen Sterna in an apartment on Sørskog Road. Later, Henrik Inge took over that apartment, and when I came to Baysang, I’d go there to find him.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 20:16:50] Baysang \"Cave\" Nightclub | A year later, I brought a tape recorder to interview the American band Wall of Voodoo, who were playing that night at the Stovik nightclub. I hadn’t made an appointment, but with my press pass I got in easily during soundcheck. We waited in the corridor leading to the stage. I wore a white shirt, black jeans, a wide belt buckle shaped like a large shiny eagle, black pants, and leather boots. But when the band members arrived, I suddenly lost my nerve—they looked intimidating, like a thirty-year-old drug crew from Los Angeles. It was Henrik Inge who saved the situation. 'Hey, man!' he called out. The bassist turned and came over. Henrik Inge said, 'This is my little brother. He came all the way from Vesfjord in the south just to interview your band, Wall of Voodoo. Is that okay?' 'Nice belt!' said the bassist. Blushing, I followed them into the band’s room. He was dressed all in black, had a large tattoo on his arm, long black hair, cowboy boots, and was extremely friendly—he gave me a beer and patiently answered every one of my amateurish, school-newspaper-level questions.\n[1998-07-18 20:17:00] Baysang | Another time, I interviewed Blaine Reininger, who had just left Tuxedomoon, on a soft leather sofa at Gallery Café. This city—with its cafés, concert halls, and record stores—was where I would move after high school. I never hesitated about that. After the Wall of Voodoo concert, we sat at Stovik and decided that when I came here, we’d start a band: Henrik Inge’s friend Bård could play bass, Henrik Inge would play guitar, and I’d be drummer. We’d find a lead singer later. Henrik Inge could compose, I’d write lyrics. That night we promised each other: one day, we’ll perform right here at Stovik. It wasn’t just the places—cafés, shops, parks, reading rooms, auditoriums—but also all his friends. When I met them, they not only knew who I was, but also what I was doing: I had my own music program on the local radio, promoted records and concerts in the local paper *Hjemmefolk*. After meeting them, Henrik Inge always told me what they’d said about me—often compliments from girls, calling me handsome or stylish. But boys talked too, especially Arvid, who once remarked I resembled the boy in Visconti’s *Death in Venice*. In their eyes, I was someone—and I owed it all to Henrik Inge. He took me to Vinjer Hut, where he and his friends gathered every New Year’s Eve. One summer I sold tapes on the streets of Aucity and made good money. We went out almost every night. One evening, I remember, I drank five beers in a row without losing control—Henrik Inge was both amazed and proud. By summer’s end, I was dating Henrik Inge’s girlfriend’s younger sister. To me then, stepping into Baysang was stepping into my future. Leaving my current life behind, living in the future for a few days, then returning. In Vesfjord I was alone, fighting every battle by myself. In Baysang, I was with Henrik Inge—what he had, he shared with me.\n[1998-07-18 20:17:10] Vesfjord | During that period, he took many photos of me with his Nikon SLR camera—all black-and-white, all terribly posed. Once, we even went to a photo studio to get pictures for Christmas gifts for our grandparents and great-grandparents. They received the photos, but copies also ended up in the photographer’s display window in the lobby of the Vesfjord cinema, where everyone could see our 1980s outfits and hairstyles, awkwardly staged. Henrik Inge wore a light-blue shirt, a leather cord around one wrist, hair reaching his neck with the top cut short. I wore a black-and-white striped shirt, sleeves of my black suit rolled up, my studded belt and black trousers, hair down to my neck—longer than Henrik Inge’s, with the top even shorter. I also had a dangling cross earring swinging from one ear. During that time, I often went to the cinema, usually with Vallund or other friends from Tvet... This means my life in Vesfjord had certain visible, outward characteristics, tied to fixed spaces—school, stadium, city center—and to specific groups: friends, classmates, teammates. But the person in those photos was connected in a completely different way—to intimate, hidden ties, primarily within the family, which I had once been part of, though I had since distanced myself. Henrik Inge spoke of me to his friends, but I never mentioned him to mine. When I looked at the photo in the brightly lit window, I could hardly fully identify with it... yet I did connect with it... I did connect with it... I did connect with it...\n[1998-07-18 20:17:20] Leivik North/Baysang | In 1987, after graduating high school, for some reason I didn’t move to Baysang but instead went to a small island town in Leivik North, where I worked as a teacher for a year. My plan was to write my novel in the evenings and use the salary to travel Europe for a year. I bought a book listing all the do’s and don’ts of working odd jobs across European countries. I had imagined moving from city to city, country to country—working a bit, writing a bit, living freely and independently. But the writing I produced that year earned me admission to a newly established creative writing program in Hordaland County... I was so pleased to be accepted that I changed all my plans. At nineteen, I headed for Baysang—despite all my dreams and fantasies of becoming a wanderer in the wider world. I stayed there for nearly nine years.\n[1998-07-18 20:17:30] Baysang | At first, everything went well. When I jumped off the airport shuttle at the fish market, the sun was shining. Henrik Inge worked weekends and holidays as a receptionist at Hotel Olean, and when I walked up to the front desk, he was in a great mood. He still had half an hour of work left, and afterward we bought shrimp and beer to celebrate my new beginning. We sat on the steps outside his dorm, drinking, while music from the Undertones poured loudly from the speakers in the living room. By evening, we were slightly tipsy, called a taxi, and drove down to visit Ulla, a friend of Henrik Inge’s. We had a few more drinks there, then went to Opera Café, staying until closing, with people constantly stopping by our table. 'This is my brother, Grete Lundnes,' Henrik Inge introduced me each time. 'He’s moved to Baysang and just started at the creative writing program. He’s going to be a writer.' Henrik Inge found me a student dorm in Sandviken, outside town—the original tenant was going to South America for a year. Until the room opened up, I stayed with Henrik Inge, sleeping on his sofa. He criticized me for small things, just as he’d done many times before whenever we lived together for more than a few days—ever since his Alek days. He scolded me for spreading brown goat cheese too thickly, or not putting records back properly. The same petty corrections happened again: I didn’t dry the bathroom floor after showering, I dropped butter on the floor while eating, I lowered the needle carelessly when playing records. Then one day I’d had enough. Standing by his car, he told me how I’d slammed the door too hard the last time I got in. I exploded, shouting angrily at him not to boss me around. He stopped. After that, he never corrected me again. But the balance in our relationship remained unchanged: I had entered his world, where I was the younger brother. College life was complicated—I didn’t make many friends, partly because everyone was older than me, partly because I found no common ground with them. So most of the time I drifted toward Henrik Inge, calling him to ask what he was doing that weekend. He always had plans and invited me along. Of course I came. After spending a Sunday wandering the city alone or lying in bed reading at the dorm, I desperately wanted to go see him in the evening. I found a new friend: that wonderful feeling surrounding me in the spring of 1989. Though I told myself I shouldn’t, that I should solve my problems independently, the temptation was too strong—I kept sinking into the sofa in front of his TV.\n[1998-07-18 20:17:40] Baysang | Later he moved into the dormitory, and that was bad for me, because my dependence on him became obvious; there wasn’t a single day I didn’t step into his room. When he wasn’t there, I’d sit in their living room, either one of his roommates would dutifully keep me company in conversation, or I’d just sit alone, flipping through a music magazine or a newspaper, like an unhappy cartoon version of his mother. ...When he was around, I could easily chat with his friends—there was a kind of connection there—but what about me by myself? Going alone to visit one of his friends? That would seem strange, almost too desperate, and it wouldn’t work. On top of that, my own behavior wasn’t exactly proper—I often drank heavily, to put it mildly—and whenever a thought popped into my head, I couldn’t resist picking fights with them, especially about their appearance or those small, silly traits I observed in them. I need Henrik Inge, but Henrik Inge doesn’t need me. That’s all there is to it.\n[1998-07-18 20:17:50] Baysang | After my short story written at the academy got rejected, I started university, half-heartedly majoring in literature, unable to write anything further—returning to the reality of writing was all I hoped for. This desire to return was strong, but how many people on campus don’t harbor such wishes? Our band, Kafka Makers, played gigs in Stovik, performed at 'The Garage,' some of our songs were broadcast on the radio, and we received good reviews in music magazines—it was decent, but I knew well enough that the only reason I was included was because I was Henrik Inge’s younger brother, since I was actually a terrible drummer. When I turned twenty-four, it suddenly hit me: this was truly my life, laid out precisely as it was, perhaps always had been. Student years—the most confusing and frequently romanticized period of life—would later be fondly remembered by others, but for me they left nothing but a string of bleak, lonely, imperfect days. Before achieving the goal of entering university, I had carried full hopes inside, all those ridiculous dreams typical of twenty-year-olds: about women and love, friends and joy, some secret talent within me suddenly breaking through. But when I turned twenty-four, I saw its true face. Well then, fine, so be it. I did have small joys of my own, but no, I could endure the loneliness and decline it brought. I am bottomless—bring it on, these days, I can think, I can accept... Just come! Pour your piss over me! If you want, shit on me too! I’ll take it all! I can endure! I’m a ninja myself! The girls I longed for must have seen exactly this in my eyes: ambition, faint hope—I’ve never doubted that. But Henrik Inge, throughout this entire time, had his own friends, his studies, his job, his band, not to mention girlfriends—he got every one he wanted. I am a well, I am the unfortunate, wretched, pitiful, small, awkward, unhappy, and contemptible well.\n[1998-07-18 20:18:00] Baysang | What did he have that I didn’t? Why did opportunities always come his way, while every time I spoke to girls, I either frightened them or earned their scornful looks? Still, I stayed close to him. The only friend I made during those years was Olaf Ingva, who was a year below me at the Faculty of Humanities. We met in a basic literature course when he asked me to look over his poems. I knew nothing about poetry, but I read them anyway, pointed out some vague, unclear expressions, and after that, we gradually became friends. Olaf Ingva was the type who read Beckett in high school, listened to jazz, played chess, wore long hair, and had a certain tense, restless demeanor. He was very introverted—he’d go silent if more than three people gathered in a tent—but his intelligence was obvious. His debut poetry collection was published the second year we knew each other, which filled me with envy on my part. Henrik Inge and Olaf Ingva represent two sides of my life, typically ones that never intersect.\n[1998-07-18 20:18:10] Baysang | Olaf Ingva himself naturally didn’t know that he pulled me up into this more advanced literary world, because I always pretended to know nearly everything. Here, one could write an entire article on a single line from Dante, nothing was too insignificant to elaborate upon with extreme complexity. Here, art dealt with the highest levels—not just generally high standards—but with those we somehow extracted from the rules of modernist literature, best described by Blanchot’s account of Orpheus’s gaze: night of nights, negation of negation—this stood far above the trivial, dull, and in many ways utterly miserable life we led... Beyond that, the only thing left to say was how to reach the peak. What I learned was that our absurdly small lives are still part of this world, that we can’t get what we want, nothing at all, everything lies beyond our ability and reach—thus, at this highest level, books exist, and merely reading them, no one but myself can shut me off from them.\n[1998-07-18 20:18:20] Baysang | Modern literature is a machine with all its parts assembled, a form of cognition. Once it begins to assimilate, its insights may be resisted, yet its essence remains intact, its form persists, and eventually it applies to your personal life and charisma—then suddenly everything appears in a completely new light, brimming with infinite meaning... I skimmed a bit of Adorno, read a few pages of Benjamin, bent over Blanchot for several days, glanced at Derrida and Foucault, studied Kristeva, Lacan, Deleuze briefly, and in poetry, Ekelöf, Björlin, Pound, Mallarmé, Rilke, Trakl, Ashbery, Mandelstam, Lundén, Thomson, Haug—all superficially browsed, never spending more than a few minutes on any one, reading them like prose, like a MacLean or Bagley novel, learning nothing, understanding nothing... Olaf Ingva walked this path, and I followed him like a foolish little dog, indeed I did follow him... But merely being near them, having their books on shelves, caused a subconscious substitution—just knowing they existed felt nourishing; yet if they hadn’t filled my head with these ideas and knowledge, my intuition and emotions would have been stronger.\n[1998-07-18 20:18:30] Baysang | It’s easy to assert opinions during an exam or discussion, but that’s not what I—a careful estimator—seek. What I seek is richness. For instance, when I read Adorno, this sense of richness isn’t found in the words themselves, but in the awareness generated while reading him. I am someone who reads Adorno! Amid those heavy, complex, convoluted, extremely precise sentences, striving for constant mental ascent, where each period feels like a climber’s carabiner, something else exists too—a unique understanding of the atmosphere of reality. Under the influence of these sentences, vague desires awaken in me—to use this distinctive linguistic atmosphere to express something real, alive. Not to describe an argument, but something concrete, say, a lynx, a crow, or a cement mixer. Language isn’t wrapped around reality; quite the contrary, reality emerges from language.\n[1998-07-18 20:18:40] Baysang | He studied media, a discipline entirely devoted to proving there are no objective qualities, that all evaluations are relative, that whatever is popular or unpopular is equally valid... I didn’t articulate this clearly—it didn’t exist as a thought, nor was it easily foreseeable—rather, it was some vague drive. I never let Henrik Inge see this side of me; first, he wouldn’t be interested, and second, he wouldn’t believe it anyway... But slowly differences emerged. I withdrew, filling myself more, and gradually, between the two of us, the distance grew quite large. I didn’t want it that way—nothing in the world would make me wish for it. I deliberately distanced myself. If I suffered a setback, failed at something, or misunderstood an important event, I’d tell him without hesitation, because everything dragging me down looked good in his eyes. But when it came to things I understood deeply, I often kept silent.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 20:18:50] Baysang | During this same period, I had a girlfriend I’d never truly fallen in love with—not real love—and she naturally knew nothing about this. We were together for four years... I also worked at a psychological rehabilitation center, not only following the staff, who all had nursing backgrounds, but also attending their gatherings—at popular bars with pianists and singers, places the students in this district avoided. There, I gradually adapted to their perspectives, their forms of entertainment, their scenes. So I sat there, playing a role, here and there, always acting... I didn’t take my own small thoughts seriously, or simply kept my views hidden. That’s why my character became somewhat furtive and evasive... I was too close to Henrik Inge. To assess it, seeing only the good, the excellent side in him—that was a great weakness, meaning it depended on maintaining a certain distance to be effective. Within that distance, emotional factors had to be excluded. That’s why my feelings toward him began to recede slightly. He wasn’t allowed to fail. My mother could fail, that didn’t bother me. My father and my friends could fail, I didn’t care. Especially myself—I could fail, I absolutely, fucking didn’t care. But Henrik Inge shouldn’t fail. He shouldn’t appear stupid. He shouldn’t show weakness. But when he did, I watched him with shame—not shame for his actions, but shame that he might notice I was ashamed of him, that he might discover this emotion in me. In such moments, I concealed my feelings with averted glances rather than revealing them, otherwise it would draw attention and be hard to explain. If he said something foolish or flippant, it wouldn’t change my relationship with him—I’d still judge him by my fundamental, fixed perception of him—only he might think I felt ashamed of him.\n[1998-07-18 20:19:00] Baysang \"Garage\" Bar | I suddenly heard him speaking to Inga and Hans. Like that time, late one night, we sat at 'The Garage' discussing a journal we’d long planned to create. Around us were people who could write and photograph, all sharing one common trait: trusting the Frankfurt School members as much as the 1982 Liverpool football team, trusting the Olesker Band as much as Leivik writers, trusting Oswick expressionist films as much as American TV series. We aimed to launch a news-oriented magazine, taking diverse interests seriously—football, music, literature, film, philosophy, photography, art—anything creative deserved attention. Sitting with us that evening was Inga Mjøen, then editor of the student paper *Studvest*, and Hans Myrvold, who besides singing in our band was the former editor of Inga’s student paper. When Henrik Inge began talking about starting the magazine... his voice sounded flat, dry. Of course, I lowered my eyes to the table. As Henrik Inge spoke, he glanced at me several times. Should I voice my opinion, correct his view? Or should I just shut up, not say what I think, and simply support what he says? Then Inga and Hans would think I’m sitting here only to agree with him. I don’t want that. So I chose a middle path—saying nothing, trying to use silence to signal both approval of Henrik Inge and acceptance of their evaluation of his speech.\n[1998-07-18 20:19:10] Baysang | Take the time I interviewed writer Tovevik for a student magazine, and Henrik Inge suggested we go together—I eagerly agreed. Flegstad was both accessible and intellectually sharp, his theories ranging from profound to simple, his non-dogmatic, independent, almost aristocratic leftist views, especially his wordplay, making him Henrik Inge’s favorite author. Henrik Inge himself had a reputation for puns and low humor, and his academic training led him to believe a work’s value lay not in the work itself, but in the social recognition it generated—regarding form, authentic and inauthentic expressions carried equal weight. For me, Flegstad was first and foremost a great Leivik writer. The interview was arranged by TAL, a student publication in New Leivik language. Previously, I had interviewed poet Olav H. Haug and prose writer Karin Moe. I am often so timid—I don’t want to support anyone, I pull back my own thoughts—but this time the situation was urgent and acute, not only because of Henrik Inge—within our family dynamic, I always saw him as superior—but also due to the vanity stirred by the scene, this sense of belonging, which made me unwilling to simply agree with anyone. Under Henrik Inge’s dominance, most tasks we did together, while reading and writing were almost entirely my solitary pursuits. Sometimes these two worlds collided, unavoidably, because Henrik Inge was also passionate about literature, even if his views differed from mine.\n[1998-07-18 20:19:20] Ulvik (Haug's house) | I went to interview Haug together with Olaf Ingva, and Ingva Thomasdal, a friend of Henrik Inge who was responsible for photography—so it was only natural that Henrik Inge wanted to join us this time. The beginning of the interview with Haug was disastrous. Everything turned out fine in the end, but only because I hadn't told him we were coming as three people. When our car turned into his yard, he was expecting just one person, so he wouldn’t let us through his front door at all. 'You’re too many,' he said, standing at his doorway in that firm, western Norwegian tone which made me... Haug is a permanent resident of the planet of wisdom, holding fast to himself, unmoved by anything, while I am a wanderer from that world, carrying known questions and gathering every phenomenon approaching me into my pack. It was my emotion, my crude, almost hostile attitude, that shaped my judgment of Haug—perhaps he felt something similar toward us. But finally he said, 'Well, come in then,' and tiptoed ahead of us into the living room, where we set down our backpacks and camera bags. Ingva Thomasdal took out his camera, lifting it toward the light; Olaf Ingva and I pulled out our notebooks. Haug sat on a bench against the wall, eyes fixed on the floor. 'Maybe you could sit over by the window?' Ingva Thomasdal suggested. 'The light is good there—we could take a few photos.' Haug lifted his eyes to look at him, a strand of gray-white hair falling across his forehead. 'There’s no fucking photos being taken here,' he said. 'Fine, suit yourself,' said Ingva Thomasdal. 'Sorry.' He stepped aside, putting the camera back into the photo bag. Suddenly I felt like a cheerful, carefree, foolishly eager, impulsive, ruddy-faced southerner.\n[1998-07-18 20:19:30] Ulvik (Haug's house) | Olaf Ingva sat beside me, flipping through his notebook, a pen in his other hand. For a long time, no one spoke. Olaf Ingva looked at me. Looked at Haug. 'I have a question,' he said. 'Can I ask you something?' Haug nodded, brushing the strand of hair off his forehead and tucking it back—a gesture so unexpectedly gentle, contrasting with his solid, masculine posture, that it seemed almost feminine. Olaf Ingva began asking questions, reading aloud from his notes—long, complex passages containing a small analysis of a poem. When he finished, Haug said he wouldn’t say anything about those poems, without lifting his eyes as he spoke. I understood him—I knew right then that he couldn’t possibly focus on what was written in Olaf Ingva’s notebook… I had read Olaf Ingva’s questions beforehand; they were all tightly connected to Haug’s poetry. If Haug didn’t want to talk about his poems, then all the questions were useless, completely pointless.\n[1998-07-18 20:19:40] Ulvik (Haug's house) | Then came another silence, even longer. Now Olaf Ingva was as dark and closed off as Haug himself… I had to step in, because it was clear that Olaf Ingva wouldn’t say another word throughout the rest of the interview. So I brought up a question about Jølster, my mother’s hometown, since the painter Astrup came from there—a man Haug was interested in, even writing a poem about the place. This was clearly a choice between two topics. But he didn’t want to talk about that either. Instead, he began speaking about a journey he’d made there long ago, mentioning names that sounded like they were from the 1960s. He stared at the floor, stating each name with certainty, as if we all knew them. We’d never heard of any of these people. All of it seemed meaningless, mysterious only in its personal significance. I asked a question about translation; Olaf Ingva posed another. He answered both in the same way—decisively, as if he were merely talking to himself, or perhaps conversing with the floor. They are poets, I thought. That’s just how they are. Compared to their weight and darkness, I felt much lighter—just an amateur with no real opinions, skimming the surface of everything: watching football, knowing a few philosophers’ names, enjoying the simplest variations of pop music. One of the lyrics I wrote for our band, called 'How Gracefully You Sway,' was the closest thing I’d ever written to poetry.\n[1998-07-18 20:19:50] Ulvik (Haug's house) | I recall now that, as interviews go, this one was a disaster… But then Haug changed… He became very friendly toward us, smiling and making humorous remarks… His wife came in carrying freshly baked apple cake. After we finished eating, he led us on a tour of his entire house, taking us up to the second-floor study where he usually sat to write. I saw a notebook on the desk with 'Diary' written on the cover. He brought out several books and talked to us about them… I knew Haug had never attended university… Then we walked back downstairs, and he shared some unheard-of, deeply meaningful reflections on death—spoken simply, tinged with resignation, yet not without humor. I remember one of the books was by Kristeva, because I thought, at least you haven’t read this one… Even if you had gone to university, you still wouldn’t understand this book… I told myself I must remember this—it’s important, I’ll carry it with me for life—but later, as we sat in the car driving home along the Hordaland fjord, I had already forgotten it all.\n[1998-07-18 20:20:00] Ulvik (Haug's house) | I remember when I was still a few steps behind him, Olaf Ingva and Ingva Thomasdal were already waiting outside. It was time for photographs. Haug sat on a stone bench, crossing his legs. In the same instant, Ingva Thomasdal crouched down, then stood again, pressing the shutter from different angles. Olaf Ingva and I stood a few meters away, smoking. It was a beautiful autumn day, cold and clear. That morning, when we drove out from Baysang, a layer of cold mist floated over the fjord. The trees halfway up the mountainsides were yellow and red, the fjord’s surface like a mirror, broad white waterfalls cascading down. He was an old man, dressed like one—flannel shirt, old-man pants, slippers, and a hat, with an elderly gait. Yet there was nothing in him that showed the usual signs of aging—nothing like my grandfather or my father’s uncle Alf… He was over eighty, yet there was no trace of death or rigidity in him. I was happy—the interview was over and had gone well—but also slightly stirred. Haug had filled me with unrest, something I couldn’t calm, though I didn’t know where it came from. On the contrary, when he suddenly opened himself to us, wanting to show us something, it was in an innocent, childlike way—very friendly, yet also very vulnerable, like a boy with no friends might react when someone suddenly shows interest in him. You could never imagine such a thing from my grandfather or Alf… Or maybe not—he wasn’t really opening himself at all, but rather revealing his true nature, like his behavior when we first arrived, which was self-protection. I saw something I didn’t want to see, because the man didn’t realize what he was exposing to us. Living like this must actually be too painful, I think now. It only unsettles me inside.\n[1998-07-18 20:20:10] Ulvik (Haug's house) | I bent down and crushed my cigarette butt on the ground, then straightened up and looked around for somewhere proper to throw it—littering around his yard wasn’t allowed. Finding no suitable spot, I put the butt into my coat pocket. I took out a book I’d bought at a bookstore on the way here—a collection of Haug’s poems—and asked if he could write a greeting for my mother inside. He wrote, 'Greetings to Sissel Hartlev from Olav H. Haug,' and handed it back to me. I heard Ingva Thomasdal say, 'Can we take a few shots by the apple tree?' I heard Olaf Ingva say, 'Do you think we could ask him to read us a poem?' I said, 'If you dare, then ask.' He said, 'What’s her name?' I said, 'Sissel. Hartlev. Sissel Hartlev.' I said, 'Thank you.' I remember Haug nodded, stood up, and followed Ingva Thomasdal over to the apple tree. Surrounded on all sides by mountains, it felt as if we were standing atop a vast dome. The air still carried a soft warmth—I knew this was typical of autumn in western Norway.\n[1998-07-18 20:20:20] Ulvik (Haug's house) | I heard Olaf Ingva say, 'Could you read us a poem?' Haug said, 'Hmm, yes, what poem would you like to hear?' Olaf Ingva said, 'Perhaps the one about the cat?' Haug said, 'The one in the courtyard? Perfect for here, heh heh. Let me see, here it is.' He began to read. 'The cat sits / in the courtyard / when you come home. / Say something to the cat. / He is the most watchful one in the garden.' We all laughed, and Haug laughed too. 'It’s just a short poem,' he said. 'Would you like to hear another?' 'We’d love to!' said Olaf Ingva. He flipped a few more pages and began reading again. 'Harvest season comes / these warm sunny days of September...' I remember him walking us to the door when we were leaving. Olaf Ingva had the book he wanted Haug to sign hidden behind his back, ready and waiting. Suddenly, his face lit up with shyness and hopeful anticipation.\n[1998-07-18 20:20:30] Ulvik (Haug's house) | I remember standing in the yard, eyes on the ground, listening to him read the poem. I thought this was a great, private moment meant just for us—but the thought passed quickly. The poem itself filled the entire moment: the author reading his original work at the very place it was created. This convergence was infinitely greater than us. We were so young, no wiser than three sparrows—how could we possibly receive such a moment? We couldn’t. Still, when he read, I tilted slightly sideways. It was almost unbearable. Like a joke, yet somehow capturing a form within our everyday lives. Ah, how beautiful it was—what should we do with it? And how should we face it?",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 20:20:40] Ulvik/Baysang | I felt as if I’d spent the whole day under the summer sun—tired and heavy, even though I hadn’t done anything but close my eyes and lie on a rock somewhere soaking it in. Ingva Thomasdal drove the car to a café to pick up his girlfriend Kari, who had been sitting there waiting for us during the interview with Haug. We talked briefly about what had happened that day, then fell silent in the car. We sat quietly, gazing out the windows. Outside, shadows stretched and deepened, colors growing heavier. Wind blew in from the fjord, tousling the hair of passersby. The newspaper kiosk’s flag flapped loudly in the wind. Children sat on their bicycles—there will always be children in small towns sitting on their bikes. I remember Haug giving us a salute as we left. By the time Ingva Thomasdal started the car and pulled onto the road, Haug had already disappeared inside the house.\n[1998-07-18 20:20:50] Baysang | I remember going straight to transcribe the interview from the tape as soon as I got home, because from past experience I knew that the voices of interviewer and interviewee, the questions asked, and everything that happened would blur and multiply rapidly over time… The solution was to write it all down immediately, embellishing details as needed… Olaf Ingva wrote the author profile… From the TAL editor… We later learned Haug liked the article very much; he even told Helen Sterneksen it was one of the best interviews he’d ever given… But he truly liked it—he had his wife call to request extra copies of that issue… I realized immediately that since everything had gone well, the problem must lie beyond the scope of the recording. After reading his diaries, I got the impression he wasn’t someone who gave compliments lightly. He was aware of his own hostility and the habits of old age, yet in the respect people showed him, that side of him always vanished, deeply wrapped beneath layers of civility and decency. Yet he was so sincere—he didn’t always like hiding it all away.\n[1998-07-18 20:21:00] Baysang/Birren | I remember half a year later it was Tovevik’s turn. When I called him, he said he had read the interview with Haug and was willing to accept an interview from TAL. If I were going alone, I would have been truly nervous—reverently reading all his works, preparing enough questions for hours of conversation, recording every word because my own questions might be foolish, but his answers wouldn’t be; if I messed them up, his words would carry the interview through regardless of how flawed it turned out. But when Henrik Inge was joining me, that wasn’t what worried me anymore. I’d rely on him, hadn’t finished reading all the books, only jotted down essential questions. At the same time, I noticed certain relational issues in our collaboration—I didn’t want to appear critical or seem stronger than him.\n[1998-07-18 20:21:10] Birren Café | I saw Fløgstad politely lead us into the café—a dim, typical beer-drinking place—and we sat down at a round table, hung our coats over the chair backs, and pulled out the sheets of paper with our prepared questions. We said we didn’t want to take notes or use a recorder during the interview. Fløgstad said he respected our decision. He told us about an interview he once gave to the newspaper *Daily News* in Mochengdao, where a journalist also took no notes, yet the published article was flawless and left a deep impression on him. I remember it was a gray day, early spring approaching, either late March or the first days of April, when we set off to meet Fløgstad in Birren. My preparation was worse than ever before—neither beforehand nor afterward had I been so unprepared. Henrik Inge and I had agreed not to use tape recorders or take notes during the interview, thinking it would feel stiff and overly formal. We preferred something closer to a conversation, relying instead on our impressions of what happened here or there. My memory isn’t anything special, but Henrik Inge has an elephant’s memory. We planned to write everything down immediately after the interview, filling in gaps together, so that through mutual cooperation, the whole task would be completed.\n[1998-07-18 20:21:20] Birren | I remember during the interview dividing my attention between what Henrik Inge said and Fløgstad’s reactions—not just his answers, but his tone, body language, and the content of the discussion. My own questions carried as much weight as those about Fløgstad’s writings, though comparatively they served more to fill or add context. The interview lasted about an hour. We shook hands, thanked him for agreeing to speak with us, and felt his responses had hit the points we hoped for... The next day we took the train home—no time to write anything down. Once back, we went our separate ways. We were quite exhilarated and happy—things had gone well, hadn’t they? We’d actually talked with Fløgstad! So excited, in fact, that neither of us wanted to sit down and summarize what had been said. We could do it tomorrow. It was Saturday, and Leivik football league would soon be on TV. We could go to a bar to watch the match, then wander around. We didn’t come to Birren often…\n[1998-07-18 20:21:30] Baysang (Henrik Inge's apartment) | In Henrik Inge’s room in Blegbækken, we sat at the table hastily writing down a few new questions. My heart pounded violently as I dialed Fløgstad’s number. Even when his voice came through on the other end of the line, the racing hadn’t calmed. With reverence, I explained our situation, though I could tell from his voice he already sensed what had happened. As I asked questions and he answered, Henrik Inge sat beside me like a secret agent, ear pressed to a second receiver, carefully noting down every word. We suggested calling Fløgstad to ask whether we could add a few more questions over the phone. I remember three days had passed—could we really wait another three? Then another three, and again three more? By the time we finally sat down, we remembered very little. The written questions helped greatly, and we made educated guesses about how he might have responded—some based on fragments we actually recalled, others on what we thought he would say. I took responsibility for writing it all up, devising the method to make it work. After piecing together several pages, I quickly realized it wouldn’t do—the meaning was vague and inaccurate. I suggested to Henrik Inge we call Fløgstad to ask if we could clarify a few points over the phone.\n[1998-07-18 20:21:40] Baysang | I rephrased everything into new sentences, doing so conscientiously in a way. Other passages bore traces of authenticity. After adding extra material on Fløgstad’s literary career, gathering further concrete examples or impressions from his works, it began to look convincing—indeed, quite good. Fløgstad requested to read the full manuscript before publication, so I sent him the article along with some friendly remarks. Had I known beforehand that he insisted on reviewing all interviews—or perhaps only ours—I would have been utterly foolish not to take notes. But since I’d managed this last-minute correction, I wasn’t too worried. There was certainly some discomfort about the uncertain parts, but I didn’t care much. As far as I knew, there was no need to repeat every single word of the interviewee verbatim.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 20:21:50] Baysang street | A few days later, Fløgstad’s reply lay in my mailbox at home. I stood there holding the letter. I opened it. Pulled out the manuscript of the interview. It was covered in red marks, with red comments scribbled in the margins. I saw 'I never said that.' I saw 'inaccurate.' I saw 'no, no.' I saw '???' I saw 'where did you get this idea?' Almost every sentence was marked in some way. I stood there completely frozen, staring at the page. I remember spring had arrived, the sun warm on my skin. I stood there wearing running shoes, a T-shirt, and jeans, about to head out to a music academy where Berit Hansnes, a friend of my cousin, had arranged drumming lessons for me. I assumed everything was fine, all safe. But my palms were sweaty, my heartbeat quickened. Maybe it would’ve been better not to open the letter at all—I didn’t have time, but curiosity got the better of me as I slowly walked toward the station... Then I felt myself collapse entirely. Plunged straight into darkness. I read the short note he’d attached at lightning speed, as if the shame would end the moment I reached the last word. 'This manuscript should not be published anywhere.' 'Best regards, Tovevik.'\n[1998-07-18 20:22:00] Baysang bus | When I started walking again, stumbling forward, I stuffed the letter into my back pocket, waited at the bus stop. The bus arrived just then. I boarded and sat by the window in the last row. As the bus slowly crawled upward toward the Hordaland region... Inside me, chaos reigned. Shame heated my body, nearly bringing me to tears. Humiliation burned through me. The same thought gnawed and twisted in my mind: I’m terrible. I’m no writer, never will be. That pride we’d felt—our excitement over having spoken with Fløgstad—now seemed only laughable and painful.\n[1998-07-18 20:22:10] Baysang | Henrik Inge said, 'That’s a bit unfortunate. Can’t you revise the manuscript and send him an updated version?' When I got home, I called Henrik Inge... After the worst of the despair passed, I reread the comments and the letter, noticing Fløgstad had also commented on my critiques—for instance, the adjective 'Cortázar-like'—surely he couldn’t object to that? Hadn’t I expressed my views on his books? My analysis? I wrote all this in a letter to him. Some inaccuracies in the manuscript, yes, as he pointed out, but I knew certain things he had indeed said—because I’d taken notes during the phone interview. Also, some of his objections targeted me personally, or journalism and criticism in general, which went beyond the scope of his work. If he wished, I’d be happy to base a revision on his feedback, perhaps conduct another phone interview, and send him a new draft? A few days later, I received a polite but firm reply: he acknowledged my right to explain my interpretations, but the core issue remained unchanged—the interview must not be published. I was lashed by humiliation and self-debasement for six months. During that time, seeing Fløgstad’s face, his books, or his articles always brought deep shame. This period became a joke in my life. We paid the price. I was surprised he didn’t take it more seriously. Henrik Inge disliked this view—he saw nothing amusing in the humiliation, or more accurately, he didn’t see it as humiliating at all. Our questions were sharp, the conversation with Fløgstad meaningful—that was what mattered to him.\n[1998-07-18 20:22:20] Baysang/Barrestrand/Zhenpine | The four years I lived in Baysang were almost entirely uneventful, nothing happened. I wanted to write, but couldn’t—everything felt uncertain, insubstantial. Henrik Inge enrolled in university courses, living the kind of life he wanted, at least outwardly. But at some point he stalled—he never completed his major, didn’t put much effort into it, perhaps trapped in old patterns of avoidance, or perhaps his life was filled with other ongoing matters. After finally submitting his thesis on a topic about film stars, he was unemployed for a while. Meanwhile, I began volunteering at the school radio station, gradually entering a world different from his—especially after meeting Tonje. I fell madly in love with her, and that winter we got together. Before I even realized it, my life had taken a fundamental new turn. In the early years of my development in Baysang, I remained stuck in this pattern until suddenly Henrik Inge left the city, taking a job as a cultural advisor in Barrestrand. It wasn’t necessarily what he had hoped for, but there were no other staff in his department, so in practice he became its head. He organized the local jazz festival himself. Later, his friend Arvid moved there too, and he hired him into the department. He met Marivik Lund, whom he’d known from Baysang—she was a teacher there—they got together, had a child, Ylva, and a year later moved to Zhenpine, where Henrik Inge fully immersed himself in his future profession—graphic design. I was glad he did it, but also a little worried—would posters for the Redvåg Music Festival and flyers for local events be enough?\n[1998-07-18 20:25:00] Grandmother's balcony | I turned around and pressed the cigarette butt against the inner side of the black iron railing. Tiny sparks and ash drifted onto the concrete floor. We rarely saw each other, never shook hands, not even once, and seldom looked each other in the eye. On this warm summer night in 1998, standing on the balcony outside my grandmother’s house, it all surged up inside me. My back faced the garden, he sat in a recliner against the wall. He was pondering what I’d just said—my desire to take over everything here, including the garden. Perhaps he didn’t care. His expression revealed nothing.\n[1998-07-18 20:27:00] Grandmother's balcony | I did as he said, stuffing the cigarette butt into the neck of that green Heineken bottle. \"Where's an ashtray here?\" I said. \"I know there isn't one,\" he said, \"Use that bottle over there.\" I suggested holding the funeral ceremony here—he would certainly say it was impossible, and we'd disagree, obviously something I didn't want to see happen. He'd be the realist, practical-minded, while I'm the idealist, driven by emotion. Dad was father to both of us, but not in the same way. I wanted this funeral to be a kind of reenactment, along with my endless tears, whereas Henrik Inge hasn't shed a single tear so far. I suppose our different relationships are more inwardly felt on my side, and Henrik Inge has a quietly critical attitude toward that. I don't see it that way, but I'm afraid of being misunderstood like that. At the same time, I hope our intentions could support each other. Ah, over such a trivial matter—I don't want any rift between us under these circumstances.\n[1998-07-18 20:30:00] Grandmother's balcony | A thin wisp of smoke rose from the bottle leaning against the wall. I looked for something to place over its mouth. Maybe grandmother’s bird feeder ashtray? It still had two small pieces of meatloaf and some congealed sauce inside, I thought—already covered with dew. Carefully balancing it, I gently set it over the bottle’s opening. I straightened up and stepped back. \"What on earth are you doing?\" Henrik Inge asked, looking at me. \"Making a little sculpture,\" I said, \"meatloaf and beer in the garden, or rather 'carbonade and beer in the garden.'\" \"The subtle touch is the rising smoke,\" I added, \"in a way, it's interacting with the world. This isn't just an ordinary sculpture. Leftover food—that's decay, decomposition. Also interaction, a process—something in motion. Or self-motion. Opposite to stillness. The beer bottle is empty; it no longer serves any purpose. But why shouldn't a container hold something within it? Otherwise, it becomes nothing. And yet this 'nothing' still has its shape, you see? A shape I'm trying to present here.\" \"Is that so,\" said Henrik Inge. Maybe the cigarette wasn't completely extinguished after all.\n[1998-07-18 20:32:00] Grandmother's balcony | I pulled another cigarette from the pack resting on the railing, though I didn’t really feel like smoking, and lit it anyway. \"I wanted to say something,\" I said. \"What?\" he asked. \"I've been thinking about something. Actually, thinking about it a lot. Whether we should hold the funeral here—in this house. We could get everything ready within a week if we work together. It's connected to how he ruined everything here. We can't find ourselves in this place anymore. Do you understand what I mean?\" \"Of course,\" said Henrik Inge, \"but do you think we’d have enough time? I have to return to Zhenpine by Monday night. I won’t be able to come back before Thursday. Maybe Wednesday, but most likely Thursday.\" \"That’ll work,\" I said, \"will you join in?\" \"Join in. But ask Marivik if he wants to participate too.\" \"It’s none of his business. This is our father.\"\n[1998-07-18 20:35:00] Grandmother's balcony | We finished our cigarettes without saying another word. Henrik Inge drained his drink and stood up. \"Keep going a bit longer,\" he said, \"we'll rest later tonight.\" He looked at me. \"How much have you done downstairs?\" \"I cleaned the laundry room in the basement and scrubbed the bathroom walls.\" \"Good,\" he said. Below us, evening began softening the landscape; its sharp outlines, along with people’s activities, gradually faded. Many small boats were returning to the bay... A passenger plane coming from the west passed low over the city, so low I could read the name 'Brasen Airlines' on its fuselage. With a faint rumble, it disappeared from view. In the garden below, several birds hidden among the leaves of an apple tree chirped noisily. I thought of the smells on their decks—plastic, salt, gasoline—elements that were quite significant in my childhood life.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 20:38:00] Grandmother's living room | I followed him inside. Then I walked over and stood beside her chair. She quickly looked up at me. \"Do you need anything?\" I said. \"Is it you?\" she said. \"Where is Henrik Inge?\" \"He's in the kitchen.\" \"Oh,\" she said. I heard the loud but muffled sound coming from the television above. Then I thought of grandmother sitting there inside. I couldn't possibly do anything for her—no one could—but I hoped that seeing us might remind her we were here, perhaps make things a little easier. Her gaze turned back to the TV. Her alertness hadn't vanished entirely, but she had grown thin—that was a change, or perhaps it could be explained differently: this alertness now related only to her movements, not, as before, to her character. Grandmother used to be lively, cheerful, socially active, speaking rapidly, often winking when distinguishing one topic from another. Now there was darkness around her. Darkness within her. I saw that clearly. But perhaps that darkness had always been there? Had she always been filling it? Her arms rested on the armrests of the chair, hands gripping the ends as if she were on a fast-moving journey.\n[1998-07-18 20:40:00] Grandmother's living room | I turned to leave. \"I'm going down to clean the bathroom,\" I said. She turned her head toward me. \"Is it you?\" she said. \"Yes, it's me,\" I said, \"I'm going down to clean the bathroom. Do you need anything?\" \"No, thank you,\" she said. \"Alright.\" \"You two usually don't have a drink in the evenings?\" she said. \"You and Henrik Inge?\" \"No,\" I said, \"absolutely not.\" Does she want to drink herself and drag us both down with her? Not only destroying Dad's life, but dragging his sons down too?\n[1998-07-18 20:45:00] Grandmother's bathroom | Grandmother seemed to want to say more, but I went downstairs to the cellar. Though the source of the stench had been removed, a strong foul odor still lingered. I washed the red bucket, refilled it with fresh scalding water, and continued cleaning the bathroom. First the mirror, which had a yellowish stain nearly impossible to remove. I ran upstairs to the kitchen for a knife, scraped with it, scrubbed hard with coarse cleaning foam—finally got it clean. Then the sink, then the bathtub, the window frame above the tub, the long narrow paneled glass window full of bumps, the toilet, the door, the bathroom threshold and frame. Finally, I scrubbed the floor, poured the filthy black water into the toilet, took the garbage bag out of the bathroom and up the stairs. I stood there for a few minutes, gazing out at the hazy summer darkness—it wasn't really dark at all, more like a lack of light.\n[1998-07-18 20:55:00] Grandmother's staircase | Loud noises rose and fell from the main street over there—probably a group of people heading into town. That Easter, I started drinking heavily. I was with my football team training in Switzerland, and kept drinking throughout that spring. There was always an opportunity, always a party, always somewhere I wanted to go—dressed in Juus clothes, doing whatever I pleased, acting as if it were perfectly natural. For me, those were heaven-sent days, but for Mom, who lived alone with me, it was entirely different. In the end, she kicked me out. The easiest and most insignificant thing in the world for me was finding a place to sleep—either on a sofa in a friend’s basement, in a Juus bus, or under bushes in some park. Grandmother and grandfather had also lived through the transition from the Juus era to university life—grandfather had gone through it, and so had his sons. It was an important phase. My meaningless drunkenness ruined it all. At the time, I was editor of *Juus Newspaper*, creating illustrations for a major article about the deportation of Jews from Flekker Island—one image showed Jews being driven from the ghetto to concentration camps. That too was a tradition; when my father was in his final school year, he was also editor of *Juus Newspaper*. I dragged it all into the shit. It made me think it was a Saturday night. Why did she ask about our drinking? Was it simply because of Dad’s fate, or did she associate it with something else? I remembered ten years ago, when I was part of Juus in this city, completely drunk during a parade. Grandmother and grandfather stood among the crowd lining the streets, calling me over. When they realized my condition, their faces tensed terribly.\n[1998-07-18 21:00:00] Grandmother's staircase | But back then, I never gave any of that a thought. My diaries from that period clearly show it—the only thing I cared about was emotional pleasure and joy. Now I’ve burned all my notebooks and written records. Almost no trace remains of my life before twenty-five, and rightly so—all of it was pure nonsense.\n[1998-07-18 21:05:00] Grandmother's front door | A hint of coolness hung in the air. After working, my skin was warm, and I noticed how the air wrapped around me, touched my skin, flowed into my mouth when I opened it. It enveloped the trees, houses, cars, cliffs before me. How it moves to fill the space when temperature drops somewhere—these invisible currents, always in the sky yet unseen, drifting above us like vast expanding waves, constantly in motion, slowly descending, swiftly swirling, flowing in and out of every lung, colliding with every wall and edge—always invisible, yet always present. But Dad no longer breathes. That’s exactly what happened to him—the connection with air has been severed. Now air presses on him like it does on any object—a stick, a fuel can, a sofa. He no longer needs to take in air, because air is only needed when one breathes, when one repeatedly reconnects with the outer world. Now he lies elsewhere in the city.\n[1998-07-18 21:15:00] Grandmother's bathroom | I turned and walked back into the house. At that moment, someone across the street opened a window, and music and loud voices poured out. Although the other toilet was smaller and not as run-down or dirty, cleaning it still took just as long. When I finished, I picked up the cleaning supplies, rags, gloves, and bucket and went upstairs.\n[1998-07-18 21:30:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw Henrik Inge and grandmother sitting at the kitchen table. The clock on the wall behind them pointed to nine-thirty. \"You must be done cleaning by now!\" said grandmother. \"Yes,\" I said, \"I'm finished for tonight.\" I looked at Henrik Inge. \"Did you call Mom today?\" He shook his head. \"We spoke yesterday.\" \"I promised her I'd call today. But I don't have the energy now. Maybe it's also too late.\" \"Call tomorrow,\" said Henrik Inge. \"But now I need to talk to Toneyeh. I want to speak with her right now.\"\n[1998-07-18 21:35:00] Grandmother's dining room | I walked into the dining room and closed the kitchen door behind me. I sat down on a chair for a while to gather my strength. Then I dialed the home phone number. She answered immediately, as if she had been sitting right beside the phone waiting. I briefly told her what had happened here, without going into details—just that it was terrible, that I’d been crying constantly. Then I asked a little about what she was doing, though she didn’t really want to talk about it at first, and then mentioned when she might come over. I know every subtle nuance in her voice, and now I focused on those rather than the content of her words. First came warmth, connection, longing—then it seemed all of this coiled together and shrank, as if trying to get completely close to me. My own voice carried a distance. She wanted to come near me, and I needed her to, but I wasn’t coming near her—I couldn’t.",

    "text": "[1998-07-18 21:50:00] Grandmother's living room | After hanging up, I walked into the kitchen, but no one was there. I drank a glass of water. Grandmother was sitting there watching television again. I walked over to her. \"Do you know where Henrik Inge is?\" \"No,\" she said, \"Wasn't he in the kitchen?\" \"No,\" I said. A foul stench tore at my nostrils. I stood there, unsure what I should do. Shit left behind—that was the simplest explanation. He’d been so drunk he lost control of his bodily functions. But where had she been then? What had she done? Right then, I desperately wanted to rush over to the TV and kick the screen in.\n[1998-07-18 21:52:00] Grandmother's living room | I turned around. He came down from the upper living room and stepped forward two paces. \"You and Henrik Inge don't drink, do you?\" she suddenly said, not looking at me. I shook my head. \"No. Or rather, rarely. And only a little. Never much.\" \"What about tonight?\" \"No. Are you crazy?!\" I said. \"No way am I getting pulled into that. Henrik Inge won't either.\" \"What won't pull me in?\" Henrik Inge’s voice sounded from behind. \"Grandmother asked if we usually drink a lot.\" \"Sometimes we have a bit,\" said Henrik Inge, \"but not often. Now I’ve got two kids, you know.\" \"Two?\" said grandmother. Henrik Inge laughed. I laughed too. \"Yes,\" he said, \"Ylva and Toye. You’ve met Ylva. You’ll meet Toye at the funeral.\"\n[1998-07-18 21:55:00] Grandmother's living room | I saw the faint spark of liveliness disappear from grandmother’s face. Our eyes met with Henrik Inge. I nodded. She walked into the kitchen. I shook my head, raising my eyebrows apologetically. \"This day has been long enough,\" I said, \"Maybe it’s time to go to bed?\" \"I’ll go out on the balcony first,\" he said, \"Want to come?\" \"Do you usually sit up here so late at night?\" I asked. \"What?\" said grandmother. \"I think we’re going to bed soon,\" I said, \"Are you staying up here?\" \"No. Ah. No. I’m going to sleep too.\" She looked up at me. \"Then you’ll sleep downstairs, in our old room? Nobody sleeps there anymore.\" \"We thought we’d sleep upstairs,\" I said, \"In the attic. We already put our luggage there.\" \"Alright, that works too,\" she said.\n[1998-07-18 22:00:00] Grandmother's balcony | I nodded. When I reached the balcony, he was sitting on the wooden chair attached to the outdoor table. I leaned against the balcony railing. \"Coming?\" said Henrik Inge, standing below in the living room holding a beer. \"Where did you find that?\" I said. \"It was hidden down here. I think I remember seeing it before.\" \"We need to get one of those electric lawn mowers,\" I said, \"Or whatever they call it now. A regular mower won’t work here.\" \"On Monday we’ll look in the Yellow Pages for a tool rental company,\" he said, looking at me. \"Talked to Toneyeh?\" Far off in the distance, the lights of the Baywick ferry flickered as it crossed the sea. I could see the small boats, all their lights shining.\n[1998-07-18 22:15:00] Grandmother's balcony | Henrik Inge set down his cup and leaned back against the chair’s backrest. \"Well, we’re not many,\" said Henrik Inge. \"Just us two, Marivik, Erling, Arne, Olaf, and grandmother. Sixteen people, if we count the children.\" \"No, he wouldn’t qualify for a state funeral.\" \"Have you thought more about what we should do?\" he said. \"The funeral?\" \"Yeah?\" \"No, not yet. But I definitely don’t want any damn Humanist Association ceremony. That’s absolutely certain.\" \"Agreed. So then, church-style.\" \"Right. Is there any other real option? But he’s not a member of Leivik National Church anymore.\" \"He isn’t?\" said Henrik Inge. \"I know he wasn’t Christian, but didn’t he stay in the church?\" \"He left. He once said so...\" \"He wouldn’t like that,\" said Henrik Inge, \"He wouldn’t want any association with the church.\" \"But he’s dead,\" I said, \"At least, I want it this way. I don’t want to stand there reading some damn poem in a fake ceremony. I want something proper. Something serious and formal.\" \"I completely agree,\" said Henrik Inge. High above the trees, against a sky veiled in pale gray, a bat flapped its wings.\n[1998-07-18 22:30:00] Grandmother's balcony/living room | He walked into the living room without closing the door behind him. I crushed my cigarette butt on the floor and followed. When grandmother realized we were going to bed, she tried to get up to find us bed sheets. Then she slowly walked down the stairs without turning back. I shuddered uncomfortably. \"I’m going to sleep,\" said Henrik Inge. \"We’ll manage,\" said Henrik Inge, \"Don’t worry. You go to sleep.\" \"Are you sure?\" she said, pausing for a moment in the doorway to the stairs, bending slightly toward him. \"Absolutely,\" said Henrik Inge, \"We can handle it ourselves.\" \"Alright, alright,\" she said, \"Then good night to you both.\" I turned once more toward the city ahead, from which rose a steady hum, occasionally pierced by the sudden roar of a motorcycle accelerating—usually from the bridgehead, where young people were joyriding at high speed, or from the long, straight Queen Street.\n[1998-07-18 22:40:00] Grandmother's kitchen | There was no water on the top floor, so we went down to fetch our toothbrushes and stood by the kitchen sink brushing our teeth, leaning forward under the tap to rinse, just like we were children again during summer holidays. I wiped toothpaste foam from my lips with my hand, then wiped my hands on my pants. The time was ten-forty. I hadn’t gone to bed this early in years. But this day had been extremely long. I was exhausted to the point of numbness, my mind a jumbled mess, like porridge. Yet there was still a long way to go. Maybe I’d prepared myself. I’d expected all of this long ago.\n[1998-07-18 22:45:00] Grandmother's attic | After we went up, Henrik Inge opened the window, fastened the window hook, and turned on the bedside lamp. On my side of the bed, I did the same as he did—turned on the bedside light and switched off the ceiling lamp. Henrik Inge sat down on his side of the double bed and took off his clothes. I did exactly the same on my side, undressing as well. Sleeping in the same bed felt overly intimate; we’d never done this as children—we had always approached each other in entirely different ways. But at least we each had our own sleeping bag. \"Have you ever thought Dad would never read your novel?\" Henrik Inge said, turning his head toward me. \"No,\" I said, \"I've never even considered it.\" I smelled a long-sealed scent—not from the air, but seeping out from the unused furniture here, from the carpet and the dust on the floor that had lain undisturbed for years, perhaps longer.\n[1998-07-18 22:46:00] Airport phone booth | \"I don't know whether it's good or bad,\" he said, \"but Dad will definitely sue you. I can guarantee that.\" After I finished the novel, in early June, Henrik Inge received the manuscript. The very first thing he told me after reading it was that Dad would sue me. Those were his exact words. At that moment, I was standing beside a phone booth at the airport; Tonje and I were about to leave for Turkey on vacation. I didn’t know whether he was angry or supportive, couldn’t guess how the people around me would react to what I had written.\n[1998-07-18 22:48:00] Grandmother's attic | Henrik Inge flung the blanket aside, swung his legs onto the bed, and lay down flat on his back. Then he propped himself halfway up to adjust the pillow, before lying down again. \"That sentence appears over and over in the book,\" I said now, \"'My father is dead.' Do you remember that?\" \"Vaguely,\" he said. \"Back when Henrik was escaping from the countryside. He needed an excuse, and that was the only one he could think of. 'My father is dead.'\" \"Yes,\" said Henrik Inge. \"That's right.\"\n[1998-07-18 22:50:00] Grandmother's attic | I took off my pants and socks and climbed straight into bed. First lying flat on my back, hands folded on my stomach, until inwardly I saw myself lying there like a corpse. Then I wriggled onto my side, directly facing my clothes piled on the floor like a bundle. I sat up, put my feet on the ground, picked up my pants and T-shirt, stacked them neatly on the nearby chair, and placed my socks on top. Beside me, Henrik Inge turned on the lamp, fumbling for the pull-cord switch. No, I realized slightly. So the switch must be on the lamp itself? Yes, there it was. I pressed the switch hard—it was stiff, the old mechanical kind requiring force. The lamp must have been from the 1950s, dating back to when they moved here. \"Are you going to read or something?\" he said. \"No, at least not that,\" I said. \"Then, good night,\" said Henrik Inge. \"Good night,\" I said. Fuck me, I thought, lying here like this. Ah, I'm genuinely glad he's here. If I were alone, my mind would be flooded with images of Dad—everything I thought about him would become concrete visions of death: his body, fingers and legs, his sightless eyes, hair and nails still growing. The room where he lay might resemble some drawer-like box, like those morgues always seen in American films. But now, the sound of Henrik Inge’s breathing and the small movements of his body bring me peace. All I need to do is close my eyes and let sleep come.\n[1998-07-19 02:00:00] Grandmother's attic | A few hours later, Henrik Inge got up and stood on the floor, startling me awake. At first he looked around hesitantly, then grabbed the blanket, rolled it up under his arm, walked across the room and out the door, then turned and came back. When he began doing it again, he repeated this back-and-forth walk across the floor two more times. Then he lay back down on the bed, unfolded the blanket, pulled it over himself, shook his head from side to side a few times, and mumbled something under his breath. I said, \"You were sleepwalking, Henrik Inge. Lie down and go back to sleep.\" He looked at me. \"I wasn't sleepwalking,\" he said, \"the blanket has to pass through the doorway three times.\" \"OK,\" I said, \"fine, whatever you say.\"\n[1998-07-19 02:05:00] Grandmother's attic | I knew this wasn’t the first time he had sleepwalked. When we were children, Henrik Inge was a notorious sleepwalker. Once Mom found him sitting naked in the bathtub, feet paddling in water; another time she stopped him just as he was about to walk out the front door, on his way to Helen Ster’s house to ask if he wanted to play football. He once threw the blanket straight out the window—inexplicably—and spent the rest of the night shivering beneath the covers. Dad also sleepwalked. Sometimes in the middle of the night he’d appear in my room, wearing only underwear, perhaps opening a cabinet and peering inside, or staring at me with blank, unfocused eyes. Sometimes I’d hear him rummaging through the living room, moving furniture around. Once he slept under the living room table and, upon waking, smashed his head against it, bleeding profusely. When he wasn’t sleepwalking, he talked or shouted in his sleep; when he wasn’t doing that, he ground his teeth. Mom often said she had married a soldier at war.\n[1998-07-19 02:10:00] Grandmother's attic | I myself used to urinate into cabinets at night, or merely talk in my sleep about what I was doing. By the time I was around ten, these episodes became much more frequent. That summer, while selling tapes on Aucity Street, I stayed in Henrik Inge’s student dorm. I took his pencil case, walked naked onto the lawn outside, and stood peering into every window until Henrik Inge managed to find me. I was sleepwalking, yet I denied it—proof being the pencil case, I insisted: \"Look, this is my wallet. I’m just going out to buy something.\" Countless times I stood there watching the ground sink and vanish or swell upward, walls collapse or water rise. Once I stood bracing both hands against the wall, shouting for Tonje to run out before the house collapsed. Another time I became convinced she was locked inside a closet, so I threw all the clothes out trying to free her. When spending the night with someone other than Tonje, I usually warned them in advance about what might happen. Two years ago, with my partner Lenavik, we rented a large farm near Vesfjord to write a film script, calling it our writers’ retreat. We shared a room by arrangement. Around midnight, I got up from bed, walked over to him, pulled back his blanket, grabbed his elbow, and told him, \"You’re just a puppet,\" leaving him utterly terrified. But the scene that recurred most frequently was a otter or fox crawling into my bed, which I would then hurl to the floor and stomp on until I was certain it was dead. There might be a year when nothing happened at night, but then suddenly another period would begin when I roamed up and down every single night. Waking up on the attic, in the hallway, on the lawn—always having completed some act that seemed profoundly meaningful at the time, yet upon waking made absolutely no sense.\n[1998-07-19 02:15:00] Grandmother's attic | The strangest thing about Henrik Inge’s nighttime behavior was that sometimes, in his sleep, he spoke with a southern accent. He had left Bergen at age four, and hadn’t spoken the local dialect for nearly thirty years. Yet when asleep, that accent could still emerge from his lips. This was somewhat unsettling.\n[1998-07-19 02:20:00] Grandmother's attic | I looked at him. He was lying flat, one foot sticking out from under the blanket. People often said we looked alike, but that must have been based on general impression—we both had bright complexions—but when examining individual features, we weren’t really similar. The only possible source of this illusion was our eyes, which we both inherited from Mom. After I moved to Baysang, when meeting peripheral friends of Henrik Inge who didn’t know him well, they’d sometimes ask, \"Are you Henrik Inge?\" I’m not Henrik Inge—but then came the follow-up question, because if they truly believed I was, they wouldn’t have asked. They asked because they noticed the obvious resemblance between us.\n[1998-07-19 02:25:00] Grandmother's attic | He turned his head to the other side of the pillow, as if sensing someone was watching him and disliking it. I closed my eyes. He often said Dad had completely destroyed his self-esteem, gone to great lengths to humiliate him. For a period in his life, he felt utterly incapable, worthless. During other periods, everything flowed smoothly, effortlessly, without any doubt or confusion. Now, only this latter image remained visible. My own confidence had certainly been affected by Dad too, but perhaps in a different way. At least I’d never experienced alternating phases of doubt followed by faith. For me, both were always present simultaneously—the doubt, largely shaped by my mental state, never directed toward grand ambitions, but always focused on the small things, the immediate surroundings, friends, acquaintances, girls. I constantly saw myself as inferior, regarded myself as foolish, yet inwardly carried something burning, burning every day. But when facing the grand, I never doubted I could reach as far as I desired. I knew I possessed that energy, because my longing was immense, never at peace. How could it grow quiet? How could I break through and surpass everyone?\n[1998-07-19 06:30:00] Grandmother's attic | The second time I woke up, Henrik Inge was standing by the window fastening the buttons of his shirt. He turned around. He had already put on a pair of light khaki shorts, ending just below the knees, and a gray-striped shirt, not tucked into his pants, loosely swaying as he moved. \"What time is it?\" \"Half past six. Too early for you?\" \"Yes, you could say that.\" \"I'm going downstairs,\" he said. \"You'll follow, right?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well then, don't fall asleep again?\" \"Won't happen.\"",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 06:35:00] Grandmother's attic | Hearing his footsteps fade down the stairs, I swung my legs onto the floor and grabbed the clothes off the chair. I glanced dissatisfied at my stomach—two rolls of flesh hung on either side like swimming rings. I felt along my lower back; thankfully, no handful of fat came with it. I pulled the T-shirt over my head, and as the fabric covered my face, I caught its smell. But one thing’s certain—I’ll start running again once I’m back in Baysang. At least that much is definite. Morning sit-ups every day. No, wait—that won’t do.\n[1998-07-19 06:45:00] Grandmother's attic/porch | I opened my suitcase and pulled out a white Bradley T-shirt I’d bought years ago when they played in Baysang, and cut-off deep blue shorts. Henrik Inge had already started brewing coffee downstairs, pulling bread and slices of meat and cheese from the fridge. Grandmother sat at the table, smoking, still wearing yesterday’s dress. I wasn’t hungry. Hesitantly, I took a cup of coffee out to the porch to smoke a cigarette, then picked up the bucket, rag, and cleaning supplies, and went downstairs to begin working. Though there was no sun outside, the air was still muggy.\n[1998-07-19 07:00:00] First floor of grandmother's house | I walked into the bathroom. I removed the rod stretched across above the bathtub between the walls, yanked down the shower curtain and tossed it into the garbage bag, cleaned the rod and its two mounting brackets thoroughly, then reinstalled the rod in place. To check yesterday’s work... It looked fine. Of course, signs of age and wear remained, but everything was clean. Now the question was what to do next. The laundry room and both bathrooms were done. Only grandmother’s room downstairs remained... But I didn’t want to touch her room—it would feel like an intrusion... I couldn’t bear to start cleaning Dad’s room yet either... That left only the staircase.\n[1998-07-19 07:10:00] Stairs of grandmother's house | I filled the bucket with water, took a bottle of Clorin, a bottle of green soap solution, and a bottle of Jif cream, and began working. I sprayed on the Jif, wrung out the rag, and scrubbed every inch thoroughly. Then I soaked another rag in Clorin and continued wiping. I saw all kinds of grime and debris accumulated in the gaps between the railings... The railing was grimy and blackened, nearly completely dark in places, sticky everywhere. After cleaning a section this way, parts of it returned closer to its original pale brown color. I remember we didn’t have Jif back then. But there was Ajax powder... Green soap stood there. Clorin stood there... A detergent brand called Omo. A cardboard box filled with powdered soap... The smell of Clorin and that blue bottle brought my thoughts back to the 70s... Yet somehow I often get interrupted in these recollections... As if we’ve arrived somewhere else... But what happens behind what the eyes can see? Does the shrinking continue there?\n[1998-07-19 07:30:00] Stairs of grandmother's house | I am on a football field, smelling the scent of freshly mowed grass after watering... Hearing children’s shrieks and laughter from the pond across the road, tasting the sharp yet sweet flavor of XL-I drink. Or perhaps the inevitable salty taste filling my mouth... I see glowing seaweed... The sun blazing in the high blue sky above the ocean... Short thumping sounds cutting through the roar of an engine... I recall a summer afternoon after training... I feel the whole world exists between those old product names and the ones now. When I think of them, the world ascends to a new level with its own sounds, tastes, and smells—utterly irresistible, just as everything a person has lost, everything that has vanished, actually still exists. The little boat seems like an illusion, because the surrounding space is so vast and open, leaving an impression only because of its proximity in the mind.\n[1998-07-19 07:40:00] Stairs of grandmother's house | I realize it all still continues. Bare rock is just like this... The only difference is... neither carries meaning anymore. When I now hold a pair of soccer shoes in my hands, I only feel an echo from childhood—nothing more. They themselves contain no meaning. Meaning in today’s world has shifted; the shift continues, drawing ever closer to meaninglessness.\n[1998-07-19 08:30:00] Stairs of grandmother's house | I wrung out the rag and draped it over the edge of the bucket, surveying the results of my labor. I had finished cleaning the handrail from the first to the second floor... I heard Henrik Inge’s footsteps outside. I saw him appear, holding a bucket, a roll of garbage bags tucked under his arm. I heard him say, \"You’re done downstairs, right?\" I said, \"No, are you crazy? I only cleaned the bathroom and laundry room. Was still thinking about where to go next.\" He said, \"I’m starting on Dad’s room.\" I said, \"Did you finish the kitchen?\" He said, \"Yeah. Just a little bit left...\" I said, \"Okay, I’ll take a break now. Think I’ll eat something. Is grandmother in the kitchen?\" The paint’s sheen had come through, though here and there dark stains remained, as if etched into the wood.\n[1998-07-19 08:45:00] Kitchen of grandmother's house | I went upstairs to the kitchen. I went to the medicine. I opened the cabinet and took out the pillbox. I got a glass from the cupboard, filled it with water, and handed it to her with the pills. Instead of the bread slices I’d first considered, I took out a few apples, then poured a glass of water and a cup of coffee. I asked her, \"Have you taken this today?\" She asked, \"What? Medicine?\" I said, \"Yes, the one I gave you yesterday.\" She said, \"No, I haven’t taken any medicine.\" Did she take her medicine herself? Definitely not. To avoid sinking back into silence, I took out a few apples...\n[1998-07-19 09:00:00] Kitchen of grandmother's house | I saw the gray sky, mild, just like yesterday. A light breeze blew in from the sea, and seagulls screamed high above the ocean. Nearby, I heard metallic hammering sounds. I saw a tall construction crane rising above the rooftops inside the dockside neighborhood—the top part yellow, with a white operator’s cabin, or cockpit, where someone sat. It strikes me as strange that I hadn’t noticed it earlier. I think it’s hard to find anything more beautiful than a tower crane...\n[1998-07-19 09:15:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I just ate an apple... Henrik Inge came walking across the garden. I opened the seal and looked inside. Hearing him say, 'Look what I found.'... He said, 'There's almost two hundred thousand there.'... I said, 'My God, where were they kept?'... He said, 'Under the bed. This must be the money he got from the house on Elve Street.'... I said, 'Damn, so that's all that's left?'... I said, 'Jesus, this money—his life here was truly fucking miserable.' I saw the envelope filled with one-thousand-kroner notes.\n[1998-07-19 09:30:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I put the envelope on the table. I shrugged my shoulders. Henrik Inge stood up and grabbed the envelope. I followed behind him as we went in. He said, 'What should we do with it?'... I said, 'I don't know, I guess split it?'... I said, 'Ask someone else, like Berit Hansnes...'... I said, 'Who could this belong to?'... He said, 'Who should keep it? You do. At least now the funeral expenses are covered.' I heard engine noise rumbling from the small street below the house...\n[1998-07-19 10:00:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I heard voices in the hallway downstairs. We were standing between the hallway door and the kitchen door when they came upstairs... Grandmother stood up in the kitchen. She said, 'Hi, you two!'... I said, 'Hi, haven't seen you in a long time.'... Marivik said, 'Sit down, Mother, we just thought we could help Henrik Inge and Grete Lundnes clean up here.'... Grandmother said, 'Then you can have some coffee, can't you?' I felt slightly uneasy, as if we were still children. How old were they exactly? Almost fifty?\n[1998-07-19 10:10:00] Grandmother's living room | Marivik stepped into the kitchen. He turned his eyes away. He turned and walked into the living room. I followed behind him. He said, 'You've already done quite a bit, impressive.'... I said, 'We want to hold a gathering here after the funeral.'... He said, 'But that probably won't work.'... I said, 'Yes, we have five days. It'll work.'... He said, 'It's up to you... We're throwing out everything that's ruined. There's no point saving anything here. What about these sofas?'... I said, 'One is okay, we can clean it. But the other one, I think...'... He said, 'Then let's get rid of it.' Maybe it was the tears in my eyes.\n[1998-07-19 10:20:00] Grandmother's living room / balcony | I walked to the other end of the sofa and bent down to grab the bottom. As we carried the sofa through the living room, grandmother stood at the kitchen doorway. I stopped. Marivik said, 'Let's take it out through the balcony door.'... Grandmother said, 'What are you going to do with the sofa?'... Marivik said, 'We're throwing it away.'... Grandmother said, 'Are you completely mad?! Why would you throw it away? You can't just toss out my sofa!'... Marivik said, 'We have to throw it away, you understand? Come on, Grete Lundnes, let's get it out.'\n[1998-07-19 10:30:00] Grandmother's balcony / garden | I stepped aside a few paces without looking at grandmother... I went down the two steps, feet touching the ground... I felt the wind on my bare legs, arms, and face... We placed the sofa on the balcony... Grandmother said, 'This can't happen!... Oh... huffing!... No, I don't want to see this.'... Marivik said, 'How's that, okay?'... I said, 'Okay.' Her wishes burned in my heart. Marivik didn't seem to notice. She had changed completely. Her eyes were shining.\n[1998-07-19 10:40:00] Grandmother's garden | Once we'd positioned the sofa properly on the trailer... I had no idea what to do, so I just stood there watching him... He said, 'Stop thinking about her now, she doesn't know what's best for her anymore.'... I said, 'Right, won't think about it.'... He said, 'Anything else that needs to be thrown out?'... I said, 'Some things in his room...'... He said, 'Maybe her mattress too?' I thought maybe about a meter of the sofa hung off the back of the trailer...\n[1998-07-19 10:50:00] Grandmother's garden | I saw him gather the remaining rope into one place... Looking at me... When our eyes met, he held my gaze for several seconds... He placed his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered with a sob. He said, 'That's enough... By the way, have you checked the garage?'... I said, 'No?'... He said, 'All his stuff is in there...'... He said, 'It's not easy here for you, I understand... You're both good kids.' His eyes, on that sun-tanned face, looked almost as clear and blue as Dad's. He had refused to accept far too much. Something burst open inside me.\n[1998-07-19 10:55:00] Grandmother's garden | I had to turn my body away from him. Lean forward, bury my face in my hands. My body trembled. I straightened up again, taking a deep breath. I said, 'Do you know anywhere I could rent a machine?'... He said, 'You want to sand the floor?'... I said, 'No, no... But I was thinking, maybe to cut the grass here...'... He said, 'There's a machinery rental company in Grim. They should have something like that. But check the phone book.'",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 11:00:00] Grandmother's house / father's room | I followed behind. I saw Henrik Inge standing in the room, looking out at us. He picked up... the envelope and handed it to Marivik. Henrik Inge said, 'We might need to throw out the mattress... Also, we found this under the bed.'... Marivik said, 'So how much is here?'... Henrik Inge said, 'About two hundred thousand.'... Marivik said, 'Well then, it's yours now, but remember your sister when you divide it.'... Marivik said, 'Whether to notify the tax authorities is your own choice.' I saw the white base wall of the neighboring house begin to glow faintly. A crack appeared in the clouds, and sunlight poured through. Did he think about it? I hadn't.\n[1998-07-19 11:15:00] Grandmother's house | A quarter of an hour later, Marivik drove away with the trailer fully loaded... All the doors and windows of the house were wide open, air flowing through the rooms, mingling with the sunlight cast on the floor and the scent of cleaning agents—at least upstairs, there was a striking change. I felt as though the entire house had opened itself completely, becoming a place as unobstructed as the world itself. This deeply touched my emotional world—I noticed it, and I liked it very much.\n[1998-07-19 11:28:00] Grandmother's house stairs/kitchen | I continued cleaning the stairs... I went up to the kitchen to change the water. As I was pouring out the dirty water... I saw the water slowly swirling in circles down the drain, gradually diminishing—grayish-brown, murky—and finally, the white foam sank and disappeared, leaving only a dull layer of sand, hair, and various fragments of debris against the gleaming metal bottom of the sink. I noticed that grandmother lifted her head, but her gaze was blank and disinterested; soon her eyes turned back to the potted plant on the table.\n[1998-07-19 11:34:00] Grandmother's house kitchen/living room | I turned on the tap and let the water spray against the bucket wall for a while... I could fill it again with fresh, steaming hot water. When I stepped out into the living room right after, I saw Tove turn toward me and smile. She said, \"Yes, everything looks completely different now.\"\n[1998-07-19 11:35:15] Grandmother's house living room | I stopped. I said, \"At least, it's starting to change.\"... She said, \"She never cleaned at all.\"... I said, \"It usually looks quite clean, doesn't it?\"... She said, \"Oh no... Whenever I come into this house, it's always filthy... In that respect, she's certainly no homemaker.\"\n[1998-07-19 11:38:00] Grandmother's house living room | I nodded... I spread my arms and raised my eyebrows in a gesture expressing sympathy yet helplessness. I said, \"Perhaps not.\"... She said, \"But she deserved a better life. After grandfather died, we thought she'd have a few good years... We arranged home care for her...\"... I said, \"I've heard about it.\"... She said, \"We did what we could... But everything ended up falling on us.\"... I said, \"I know.\"... She said, \"Now she has to go into a nursing home...\"\n[1998-07-19 11:39:40] Grandmother's house living room | I smiled back at her. I said, \"Yes.\"... She said, \"How is Cecil doing?\"... I said, \"Fine... She's working at the nursing school in Førde.\"... Tove said, \"When you talk to her, be sure to give her my regards.\"... I said, \"I'll make sure to pass it on.\"\n[1998-07-19 11:45:00] Grandmother's house stairs | I saw Tove pick up the cloth again; I walked downstairs... set down the bucket, wrung out the cloth tightly, and sprayed some Jif on the banister. I heard Henrik Inge say, \"Grete Lundnes?\"... I said, \"Hm?\"... He said, \"Come down here.\"\n[1998-07-19 11:46:30] Grandmother's house hallway | I saw him standing in front of the mirror in the hallway... He handed me an envelope. He said, \"Look here.\"... I said, \"He wrote her a letter? From here?\"... Henrik Inge said, \"Apparently so... This must be some birthday greeting or something...\"... I said, \"I can hardly believe he even knew she existed.\"... Henrik Inge said, \"But he found it just as unbelievable... He must have actually thought of her.\" I saw the address on the envelope was sent to Zhenpine, addressed to Ylva Grete Lundnes. Inside was a sheet of paper with the heading 'Dear Ylva,' and otherwise, a blank stationery card.\n[1998-07-19 11:51:00] Grandmother's house hallway | He handed me the letter... I read it. June 29th... My eyes met Henrik Inge’s. Then we burst out laughing. I said, \"She's his eldest granddaughter.\"... Henrik Inge said, \"Yes... But we're talking about Dad, not someone else...\"... I said, \"Damn, this is truly pathetic.\"... Henrik Inge said, \"I found something else too... Look at this.\"... I said, \"Two weeks before he died.\"... I laughed, \"Debt-free and truly carefree now. Heh heh heh!\" This was a letter from the National Educational Loan Fund, notifying him that his student loan had been fully repaid.\n[1998-07-19 16:00:00] Grandmother's house | I saw Henrik Inge sorting and organizing papers, I scrubbed the stairs, grandmother sat in the kitchen... At four o'clock, Henrik Inge was going to drive out to buy dinner groceries... I heard the scraping of table legs across the floor upstairs, followed by her footsteps... An hour after Marivik and Tove left, the atmosphere in the house changed again... The surge of life and movement ebbed into silence... Outside, the sky was once again layered with clouds... I felt as if everything that had happened was closing up again... Deep inside, I hoped grandmother wouldn't wander around the house... Because I felt my heart was so fragile and sensitive...\n[1998-07-19 16:04:00] Grandmother's staircase | I saw her tightly gripping the stair railing... She stood there for a long time, staring at my hands... Then she looked up at my face... She sighed. She said, \"So you're here.\"... I said, \"Yes, but I'll be done here soon.\"... She said, \"Then where is Henrik Inge?\"... I said, \"He went to buy groceries.\"... She said, \"You're so diligent... You really are very diligent.\" Our eyes met, and a chill ran down my spine. It seemed as if she hated me.\n[1998-07-19 16:16:00] Grandmother's staircase | I laughed, tossed the rag into the bucket of water now nearly completely murky, and grabbed the handle of the bucket. I said, \"Well... it's good to be capable, isn't it?\"... I said, \"He's back.\"... She said, \"Who? Marivik?\"... I said, \"Henrik Inge.\"... She said, \"Isn't he supposed to be here already?\"... She said, \"Ah yes... I must be getting a bit confused again.\"... I said, \"Let's make something to eat.\" I heard the roar of a car engine outside.\n[1998-07-19 16:18:30] Grandmother's kitchen | In the kitchen, I emptied the bucket of water... As I picked up the ashtray from the table, she pulled back the curtain... I rinsed the ashtray... Then began wiping the table, just as Henrik Inge walked in carrying two grocery bags.\n[1998-07-19 16:21:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw him set down the bags and start taking out the groceries... I turned on the stove... Poured the potatoes into the sink and turned on the tap, scrubbing them in my hands... I saw four vacuum-packed salmon fillets, a bag of muddy potatoes... 1.5 liters of Sprite, 1.5 liters of CB beer... A slab of butter slowly melting across the black bottom of the frying pan. In the rooms where he had lived, the scent was cigarette smoke and oranges. It made me think again about how clean these packages were... The smell they released into the room the moment they were peeled or cut always reminded me of Dad.\n[1998-07-19 16:26:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Henrik Inge crumpled the two empty shopping bags together... Water sprayed from the stream under the tap onto the potatoes in my hands... Grandmother said from the table, \"Yes, yes.\" Butter sizzled in the pan... The metal plate at the bottom of the sink became clean, bright, and shiny again. I thought, but why is this? What causes this 'joy'?\n[1998-07-19 16:29:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Henrik Inge stood in the middle of the floor drinking a cola... He put the empty glass on the counter and belched several times. He said, \"Is there anything I can help with?\"... I said, \"No, everything's fine.\"... He said, \"Then I'll go out for a walk.\"... I said, \"Go ahead.\" I saw her sunken eye sockets, her glowing eyes filled with darkness, her entire body nothing but a skeleton.\n[1998-07-19 16:32:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I placed the potatoes in water... Found salt on the range hood... Sprinkled some into the pot... Took out the four pieces of fish... I said, \"Dinner is fish—salmon.\"... Grandmother said, \"Ah yes, that must be delicious.\" The heated water began to stir... The salt was stored in a small silver Viking ship...\n[1998-07-19 16:36:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I placed the fish fillets in the frying pan... Turned down the heat under the boiling potatoes... I looked at her... Grandmother said from over there, \"Oh... umm...\"  Within seconds, the flesh beneath the fish turned from deep pink to a very pale shade. I thought she should take a shower... But who would take care of that?... He was her first child... That a child should die before their parents is unthinkable... And then again, who exactly is Dad to me?...\n[1998-07-19 16:42:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I tore open the package of beans... Turned off the burner, and glanced at the wall clock... Grandmother looked at me and said, \"Do you drink beer when you eat? I saw Henrik Inge bought a bottle.\" A thin, fuzzy mist coated the surface of the beans... Four forty-two. Cauliflower needs another four minutes...\n[1998-07-19 16:43:10] Grandmother's kitchen/ balcony | I shook my head... Flipped the fish... Poured the beans into the pot... Moved the frying pan aside... Then walked out to Henrik Inge on the balcony. I said, \"Sometimes we do, but rarely. Actually, hardly ever.\" Dark brown oil seeped out, spreading across the pale meat. I wondered—did she see that?",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 16:44:30] Grandmother's balcony | I said, \"Dinner will be ready soon...\" I said, \"The beer you bought—is it for drinking with the meal?\" He said, \"So what?\" I said, \"It's Grandmother... she asked if we usually drink beer when we eat...\" Henrik Inge said, \"Of course I understand, but you're a bit too worried.\" I said, \"Then we agree?\" He said, \"Yes!\" I said, \"Dinner will be ready soon...\" I said, \"The beer you bought—is it for drinking with the meal?\" He said, \"So what?\" I said, \"It's Grandmother... she asked if we usually drink beer when we eat...\" Henrik Inge said, \"Of course I understand, but you're a bit too worried.\" I said, \"Then we agree?\" He said, \"Yes!\"\n[1998-07-19 16:46:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I walked back into the kitchen and began setting the table... used a spatula to lift the cooked salmon pieces from the pan... Henrik Inge came in from the balcony. Letting the wet potatoes steam upward... pale red, light green, white, dark green, brownish. I thought I wouldn't detect the irritation in his voice...\n[1998-07-19 16:48:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I found them from the drawer... sat down and started peeling the skin off one potato... then stood up again to get butter from the fridge... He said, \"This looks good... but maybe the cutlery isn't set yet?\" Henrik Inge said, \"You're peeling potatoes?\" I said, \"You're right.\" I felt the hot potato skin burning my fingertips... I heard him say inside my head that actually it tastes quite delicious with bacon and other ingredients... I no longer cared about such things...\n[1998-07-19 16:53:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw Grandmother was eating now too... I raised my glass to my lips and drank some water... Grandmother sighed. I said, \"Marivik said there's a machinery rental company in Grim...\" Henrik Inge said, \"Fine, let's do that.\" I could smell a faint stench of urine... the water had a slight metallic taste... Henrik Inge's knife and fork clattered in his plate. A wasp or a bee... I thought she eats a bit like a rodent... Ah, we'll have to put her in the bathtub...\n[1998-07-19 16:56:00] Fish shop | Once, Grandmother and I went there... I walked over to a wooden crate full of live crabs... Grandmother leaned forward... I remember the atmosphere we felt walking into the fish shop... those fat codfish... their mouths slowly opening and closing... the smell of salt inside... I know they even eat fish in this house on Christmas Eve... I thought crabs were like some kind of vessel... It was a magical adventure... but all that strange aura surrounding fish... has completely vanished...\n[1998-07-19 16:59:00] Grandmother's kitchen / outside Torungen Lighthouse | I remember once... when we came off the boat and walked across a small island... carrying two buckets full of crabs... we lit a bonfire. A night under deep blue August skies outside Torungen Lighthouse... flames puffing straight up into the air. Around us, the heavy sea. Dad's face glowing. I've often seen Dad take leftover fish from the fridge... his favorite is still crab... I wonder when it was that I went to the fish shop with Grandmother?... Where do such images really come from... probably they are everywhere.\n[1998-07-19 17:02:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I put down my glass, cut off a piece of fish, and stuck my fork into it. I felt the flesh beneath the three tines of the fork loosen and break apart—this deep gray, greasy meat so soft...\n[1998-07-19 17:10:00] Grandmother's living room / dining room | I began continuing the work Tove left behind... I wiped clean all these little ornaments... I saw it was raining outside. A neat row of tiny water droplets covered the windowpane... an oil lamp that looked as if it came from *One Thousand and One Nights*...\n[1998-07-19 17:30:00] Grandmother's living room | As I stood there looking at the photos, I heard Grandmother getting up in the kitchen... I wiped the glass pane... picked up... the small stand. I saw Grandmother watching me, hands behind her back. She said, \"No, you really don't need to wipe them...\" I said, \"It's fine, almost done...\" She said, \"You don't usually have a drink in the evening, do you?\" I said, \"No...\"\n[1998-07-19 18:00:00] Grandmother's living room | I cleaned all the shelf boards... Grandmother realized she wouldn't get anything here, turned around... then I heard her voice... I went into the kitchen to fetch the glass window spray... Across the river, the town was lighting up... I wondered what time it might be now... the idea of drinking has truly taken root in her mind...\n[1998-07-19 18:15:00] Grandmother's living room | I sprayed some cleaner on the glass door of the display cabinet... Then raindrops began tapping against the windowpane in front of me... Grandmother passed behind me... Now, above the harbor below, the sky is filled with thick lines of rain... I didn't turn around, but the movement of her body still filled my awareness...\n[1998-07-19 18:30:00] Grandmother's dining room | I placed the cloth on the shelf and went over to Henrik Inge. He said, \"There are bottles everywhere here too...\" I said, \"Did she also ask you whether we usually drink?\" He said, \"It's not that she wants to drink alcohol... She just wants a little sip...\" I said, \"Are you really sure about that?\" He said, \"The point now is that she wants a little. She needs our approval.\" I said, \"So what should we do now?\"\n[1998-07-19 19:00:00] Grandmother's balcony | Half an hour later, having finished cleaning the cabinet with shelves, I went out onto the balcony... The rain has stopped... Plastic bottles lying on the concrete floor glisten with droplets... I feel their necks resemble gun muzzles... That Dad was here just three days ago seems unbelievable... The fact that he can never see any of this again is incomprehensible to me...\n[1998-07-19 19:10:00] Grandmother's balcony | I lit a cigarette, wiped my hand across the damp chair a few times, and sat down. Along the far end of the lawn, a cat crept cautiously through the garden fence. It was an old cat with gray-and-white spotted fur. It paused at the entrance, raised its front paws, looked down at the grass for a moment, then continued forward. I thought I only had two cigarettes left. I’d have to go down to the kiosk before it closed. I thought about our cat, Nansen, whom Tonje had poured all her love into. A tiny kitten only a few months old, sleeping under the same blanket as Tonje, its little head poking slightly out. All day long, I hadn’t thought of Tonje once. Not even once. What did that mean? I didn’t want to call her because I had nothing to say, but I had to, for her sake. If I wasn’t thinking of her, I knew, she was thinking of me.\n[1998-07-19 19:15:00] Grandmother's living room/kitchen | I crushed the cigarette on the floor, stuffed the butt into the mouth of a plastic bottle, stood up, and walked inside to my grandmother, who was watching television. I picked up the remote and turned off the volume. I said, \"Your seagull has come. Shall I feed it some salmon?\" She heard me and said, \"Ah, but I can feed it myself, you know.\" High in the sky above the sea, a seagull glided smoothly toward us. I noticed its target was the balcony—my grandmother’s seagull coming to feed. But since I was sitting there, it didn’t dare descend, so it landed on the roof instead, immediately throwing its head back with a sharp, piercing cry. She rose slowly, hunched over, and went into the kitchen. I wondered if a small piece of salmon would be okay. I noticed that I smiled.",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 19:20:00] Grandmother's dining room | I walked into the dining room, sat down by the phone, and dialed my home number. I said, \"Hi, is this Tonje?\" She said, \"Hi, it’s me, Grete Lundnes.\" \"Oh, hi...\" \"Hi,\" she said. \"How are you?\" I said, \"Not good. Everything here feels so heavy. I’ve been crying almost nonstop. But I’m not even sure what I’m crying about. Dad is dead, of course. But it’s not just that...\" She said, \"I wish I were with you. I miss you.\" I said, \"This is a house of death. We walk around washing away his death. He died right there in that chair inside, and the chair is still standing there. Everything that happened here before remains, I mean, everything from when I grew up here—it’s all still present, suddenly rising vividly before me. Do you understand? In a way, I’m so close to it. I am the child I was. Dad is the dad he was then. All the emotions from that time are flooding out.\" She said, \"Poor Grete Lundnes.\" I know every subtle nuance in her voice. Now, I focus on these nuances rather than the content of her words. First comes warmth, transmission, longing—then it feels as though all of it wraps together and shrinks, as though it wants to get completely close to me. My own voice carries a distance. She wants to get close to me, and I need her to, but I don’t move closer. I can’t.\n[1998-07-19 19:25:00] Grandmother's dining room | I saw Grandmother pass by outside the door in front of me, carrying a plate with a piece of salmon. She didn’t look at me. I followed her with my eyes until she disappeared into the other living room. Through the glass door to the balcony, I saw her place the plate outside. She stepped back a few paces, looking around. I said, \"Don’t, don’t feel sorry for me. You should feel sorry for him. His life ended in such a cursed way—you can hardly believe it.\" She said, \"And how is your grandmother reacting?\" I said, \"I’m not entirely sure. She’s deeply shocked. Seems almost senile. She’s become terribly thin. They just sat here drinking. Her and him.\" She said, \"She drinks too? Your grandmother?\" I said, \"Yes, she does. Hard to believe. But we’ve decided to clean everything up and hold the funeral here.\" She said, \"That sounds like a good idea.\" I said, \"I don’t know, but that’s what we’re doing now. Scrubbing this damn whole house, then decorating it. Buying tablecloths, flowers, and...\"\n[1998-07-19 19:30:00] Grandmother's dining room | I saw Henrik Inge’s head peek in from the doorway. When he saw I was on the phone, he raised his eyebrows and pulled back. At the same moment, Grandmother came back in from the balcony outside. She stood by the lower window, gazing out. She said, \"I think I’ll come a day early, so I can help out.\" I said, \"The funeral is on Friday, so will you take a day off, or...?\" She said, \"Yes, take a day off. So I’ll arrive in the morning. I miss you so much.\" I said, \"What are you doing today, then?\" She said, \"Nothing much, nothing special. Going to Mom and Hans for dinner. I’ll give them your regards—they’re thinking of you.\" I said, \"Oh, great. What are you eating?\" I know Tonje’s mother is an excellent cook; dining at her place is an experience for anyone who loves food. I’m not one of those people—eating is utterly indifferent to me. Fried fish sticks taste the same as grilled halibut, sausages no different from beef Wellington. But Tonje is. At the mention of food, her eyes light up. She’s a genius in this regard, thoroughly enjoying her time cooking in the kitchen; even making a simple pizza, she pours her entire being into it. She is the most sensual person I’ve ever met. And yet, she’s with someone for whom sharing meals with family and friends is merely something endured. \n[1998-07-19 19:35:00] Grandmother's dining room | She said, \"Halibut. So it’s just as well you’re not here.\" I heard her laugh. \"But it’s quite delicious.\" I said, \"No doubt. Are Magnus Nord and Karin there too?\" She said, \"Yes. And Atle.\" This trait comes from my mother. Ever since I was in high school, I’ve had long conversations with her about people we’ve met or known—what they said, why they might have said it, where they come from, who their parents are, what kind of houses they live in—all questions tied to politics, ethics, morality, psychology, and philosophy. This dialogue, which continues to this day, has shaped my way of paying attention. I know many things have happened in this family, as in all families, but no one ever speaks of them—everyone stays silent, as if bound by some unspoken decree, each member immersed in the atmosphere we’ve collectively created. What Tonje probably values most in me is precisely this attentiveness—to all the connections and possibilities within relationships, things she isn’t accustomed to engaging with or speculating about. When I show her, she always listens with deep interest. In truth, the foresight I use to observe others is really just seeing myself everywhere—perhaps this is more about Mom and me. In language and reaction, we are close; here we relate, and here I also seek connection with Tonje. It’s good, because she needs it, just as I need her vibrant senses.\n[1998-07-19 19:40:00] Maputo, Mozambique | I said, \"I miss you, but I’m glad you’re not here.\" She said, \"You must promise me you won’t shut me out from what you’re going through.\" I said, \"I won’t.\" She said, \"I love you.\" I said, \"I love you too.\" I said, \"Will you call tomorrow?\" She said, \"Of course. Now, goodbye.\" I said, \"Goodbye. Say hello to Henrik Inge.\" Maputo, Mozambique 1994 When I say 'I love you too,' I always wonder whether it’s actually true. The most intense joy has faded. Clearly, I love her—I certainly do.\n[1998-07-19 19:45:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I hung up the phone, walked into the kitchen, and saw Henrik Inge leaning against the kitchen counter. I sat down on a chair by the side. I said, \"It was Tonje. She sends her regards.\" He replied, \"Thank you. Please send my regards back to her.\" I said, \"We'll call it a night now, don't you think?\" He said, \"Yes. At least I can't keep going any longer.\" I said, \"I'm going down to the kiosk. Then we can... yeah, you know. Want me to get you anything?\" He said, \"Could you grab me a pack of cigarettes? Maybe some chips or something too?\"\n[1998-07-19 19:50:00] Grandmother's hallway | I nodded, stood up, went downstairs, put on the jacket hanging in the closet there, checked my bank card in the inner pocket of my clothes, and looked at myself in the mirror before leaving. Suddenly, on the stairs, I stopped. I look utterly exhausted. Although I last cried several hours ago, it still shows around my eyes. They aren’t swollen—rather, they appear dull and moist. I thought about all the things we need to ask grandmother. So far, we’ve been too cautious. For instance, when did the ambulance arrive? Was it timely? If there were signs of life upon their arrival, what emergency measures did they take?\n[1998-07-19 19:51:00] Grandmother's staircase | I imagined the ambulance arriving with flashing lights and blaring sirens, pulling straight up onto the driveway above. The driver and medic jumping out, rushing up the steps with equipment. Was the front door locked? The door here is always locked—did she have enough strength to come down and open it before they arrived? Or did they stand here ringing the bell? What did she tell them when they came in—'He’s lying in there'? Did she lead them into the living room? Was he sitting in that chair, or lying on the floor? What life-saving measures did they perform—CPR, oxygen, artificial respiration? Or did they immediately determine he was dead, without any vital signs, simply placing him on a stretcher and carrying him out, then speaking briefly with grandmother? How much did she understand? What did she say? Did this happen in the morning, at noon, or in the evening? Shouldn’t we stay here until we’ve clarified every detail about his death?\n[1998-07-19 19:55:00] Vesfjord Street | I sighed and started walking down. Above me stretched an open sky. A few hours earlier it had been uniformly covered with thick clouds, but now it unfolded like a vast landscape—expansive fields, steep cliffs, towering spires. Some areas were bright and creamy white like snow, others solid gray like mountain rock. The broad, flat regions touched by the setting sun didn’t blaze with gold or radiance, nor burn crimson as they sometimes do, but instead seemed soaked in a liquid hue. Hanging over the city was a dull red, deep rose-colored, surrounded by every imaginable shade of gray. The scene was wild and beautiful. I thought everyone should be pouring into the streets, cars stopping, doors opening, drivers and passengers craning their necks, eyes wide with curiosity and longing for beauty—what exactly is happening in the sky above us?\n[1998-07-19 20:00:00] Vesfjord Street | I could see people glancing up only occasionally, making simple remarks like 'What a beautiful sky tonight,' yet no one seemed to find it extraordinary. After all, wasn’t every day’s sky filled with fantastical cloud shapes? Each sunlit cloud unique, endlessly varied, never repeating itself. People just look—and grow indifferent. So our lives no longer include this ever-changing sky; we neither think about it nor truly see it. Why are we like this? Suppose these shifting forms held meaning—signs, messages meant for us—if correctly interpreted, we might understand everything inevitable unfolding above and remain attentive. But that’s not how it is. These changing clouds and lights carry no meaning. They appear eternal, their shapes dictated solely by chance. Even if a cloud momentarily resembles a sign, in its purest, most perfect form, it remains meaningless.\n[1998-07-19 20:05:00] Convenience store/kiosk | I reached the wider road and continued toward the intersection. As I arrived at the entrance, I bumped into the young man coming out, holding an ice cream. There were no pedestrians or vehicles—just the relaxed Sunday atmosphere. An elderly couple strolled along the opposite sidewalk. A few cars slowly descended toward the bridge. The traffic light turned red, but no one waited to cross. At the bus stop beside the store, a black Volkswagen Golf was parked. The driver, a young man in shorts, clutched his wallet, jumped out, and jogged into the grocery store, leaving the engine running. Isn’t that a bit childish? Leaving the car running just to buy an ice cream?",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 20:10:00] Kiosk | I opened the fridge door and took out three half-liter bottles of Sprite, then scanned the shelves for chips. After finding them, I grabbed two packs and placed everything on the counter. I said, 'Also give me a pack of Tiedemanns yellow tobacco and rolling paper.' She turned, took a pack from the shelf behind her, and asked, 'Rizla rolling paper?' Still not meeting my eyes. I said, 'Fine.' She said, 'One hundred fifty-seven kroner and fifty øre.' The daytime cashier in sportswear had been replaced by a girl in her early twenties. Full-figured, with dark hair and Persian facial features—I guessed she was originally from Iran or Iraq. Though round-faced and slightly plump, she was undeniably beautiful. Yet she couldn’t be bothered to look at me. Her attention was entirely fixed on the magazine lying on the counter in front of her. She slid the orange rolling papers beneath the yellow tobacco pack, placed them on the counter, and with her other hand began punching numbers into the register. Her voice carried a pure Vesfjord accent.\n[1998-07-19 20:15:00] Kiosk | I handed her two hundred kroner. She tapped the register, the cash drawer slid open, and she fished out the change. Though I stood there with my hand extended, she placed the coins on the counter. I looked at her. I said, 'Can I have a bag?' She said, 'Of course, here.' She bent her knees slightly and pulled out a white plastic bag from under the counter. I said, 'Thanks,' put the items in the bag, and walked out. What’s wrong? Is there something off about me that she dislikes? Or is she just naturally withdrawn? Isn’t occasional eye contact between shop clerks and customers normal during transactions? And placing change on the counter instead of in an outstretched hand is almost offensive—certainly feels that way.\n[1998-07-19 20:25:00] Vesfjord Street | I felt a desire to sleep with her, but not the usual kind—no burning lust, no urgent, forceful impulse, no tightening of every organ ready to conquer prey. Instead, it was gentler, tender affection, like first love, a feeling that stayed with me throughout the entire walk back up to grandmother’s house. But it wasn’t the only thought—always present too was the sadness, wrapped in that gray, uncertain sky, which I knew could at any moment fully envelop me again.\n[1998-07-19 21:30:00] Grandmother's living room | They were sitting in the living room watching TV. Henrik Inge was in Dad’s chair. When I entered, he turned and stood up. Henrik Inge said to grandmother, 'We’d like to have a drink—we’ve worked all day. Would you like one too?' Grandmother said, 'That would be lovely.' Henrik Inge said, 'Then I’ll mix you one. Maybe we could go sit in the kitchen?' Grandmother said, 'Okay.'\n[1998-07-19 21:31:00] Grandmother's hallway | Was her step on the floor a little quicker than usual? Perhaps a flicker of light had ignited in those dark hollows of her eyes? Ah, I saw it was indeed so.\n[1998-07-19 21:35:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I placed one bag of chips on the counter and opened another, pouring it into a bowl and setting it on the table. Meanwhile, Henrik Inge pulled a blue bottle of Absolut vodka from the cupboard—one found amid a heap of food when we rummaged through every drop of alcohol we could find—and then took down three glasses from the shelf, fetched a carton of juice from the fridge, and began mixing drinks with the vodka. Grandmother sat in her seat watching him.\n[1998-07-19 21:55:00] Grandmother's kitchen | He smiled and handed her a glass. Then we sat around the table, three of us drinking together. She said, \"So you two also like to have a drink at night to perk up.\" Henrik Inge replied, \"Yeah, we've worked all day. Time to relax.\" It was nearly ten. Outside, darkness was beginning to fall.\n[1998-07-19 22:00:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw how quickly her eyes regained their old sparkle, how color rose into her pale, thin face, how her movements softened. After she finished her first glass, Henrik Inge poured her another, and her mind seemed to clear as well, for soon she was talking and laughing just as she used to in earlier days. For the first half hour, I sat there like a stone, stiff and uncomfortable, because it was as if she, like a vampire, had finally received blood again. Grandmother loves drinking—that much is certain. I saw it clearly: life returning to her, filling her up inch by inch, step by step. It was terrifying, truly terrifying.\n[1998-07-19 22:10:00] Grandmother's kitchen | But I myself noticed the effect of the alcohol—my thoughts grew softer, my awareness clearer and more open. Her sitting here, drinking and laughing, no longer seeming so gloomy just two days after discovering her son dead in the living room—this didn’t feel frightening anymore. Clearly, she needed this. After sitting motionless in the kitchen chair all day, only occasionally rising to wander confusedly and silently through the house, seeing her come back to life and spirit was truly comforting.\n[1998-07-19 22:20:00] Grandmother's kitchen | So there we sat, grandmother telling us stories, us laughing, Henrik Inge chiming in, and we laughed even harder. They always found each other through wordplay, but never as perfectly attuned as this evening. Occasionally grandmother wiped tears of laughter from her eyes; occasionally I met Henrik Inge’s gaze, and in his eyes I saw joy—first tinged with guilt, then gradually replaced entirely by pleasure. We, too, absolutely needed this. We were drinking a magical liquor. This clear liquid tasted sharp and refreshing—though mixed with orange juice—and it changed our relationship, pushing what had happened out of our consciousness, like outside light shining in, opening paths for us normal people, for our normal thoughts, illuminating everything suddenly with warmth and brightness, removing all obstacles from the road ahead.\n[1998-07-19 22:30:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Grandmother still smelled of urine, her clothes still stained with grease and food, she remained terribly gaunt, having lived these last months in this rat hole with her son, our father, who still died here from alcoholism, and it was still slightly damp and cold. But her eyes—they were already sparkling. Her lips—now curved in smiles. Her hands, which until then had lain quietly on her knees, would now begin gesturing constantly, if not occupied by the half-smoked cigarette. Before our very eyes, she transformed back into her former self—nimble, lively, constantly smiling and laughing.\n[1998-07-19 22:35:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I knew all her stories—we’d heard them before—but the magic lay precisely in that, at least for me, because as she told them, grandmother returned to her past, and thus the life once lived here came back. None of the stories themselves were inherently funny; everything depended on how grandmother told them, adding infectious energy and finding humor in them herself. She always found something comical in each day, and laughed just as heartily every time. Her sons joined in too, so they always shared many small daily anecdotes with her—stories that touched her deeply, made her laugh, and which she stored in her memory, turning them into part of her own repertoire. Her sons, especially Erling and Marivik, had a particular fondness for puns and jokes. Didn’t they send Marivik to the store to buy a 'Liqtor' and a 'long memory'? Didn’t they trick Henrik Inge into believing that 'exhaust pipe' and 'carburetor' were the worst swear words, making him swear never to utter them? Dad joined in these foolish pranks too, using those 'swear words' to curse others—I never did such a thing; on the other hand, I never showed surprise when Dad used them himself. Him getting caught up in making up stories, laughing at them just like grandmother—it was incredible.\n[1998-07-19 22:45:00] Grandmother's kitchen | We drank quite a lot; the alcohol had illuminated all the darkness within us and erased any sense of mutual scrutiny. Now we could meet her gaze without difficulty. Waves of laughter rolled across the table. Even though these stories had been told a hundred times before, she delivered them vividly, as if narrating them for the first time. Then came the laughter—always utterly complete and unrestrained—because there wasn’t a trace of artificiality in it.\n[1998-07-19 22:50:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Grandmother unrolled the flood of tiny anecdotes she had gathered over eighty-five years of life, bundle after bundle, but she didn’t stop there—drunker now, more immersed, her self-awareness fading, she continued telling familiar stories with added details, until eventually they became almost unrecognizable. Take, for example, the story from the early 1930s about her working as a private driver in Bergen—a tale we all knew well, part of our family mythology, since few women held driving licenses then, let alone worked as drivers. She responded to an ad in the newspaper, she said, reading the *Evening Post* at home in Østfold, wrote a letter, got the job, and moved to Bergen. She worked for a wealthy, eccentric old lady. The young grandmother, just over twenty, lived in a room inside the grand mansion and drove the woman wherever she wished. The old lady had a dog that often stuck its head out the window barking wildly at passersby—here grandmother always laughed, remembering how embarrassed she felt. And to illustrate just how peculiar the old lady really was—perhaps already suffering from dementia—grandmother always mentioned one particular observation: she noticed money hidden everywhere in the house. Stacks of cash beneath the refrigerator, inside pots and teapots, under carpets, under pillows in the bedroom. When grandmother reached this point in the story, she usually burst out laughing and shook her head, because we must remember she had just left home, coming from a small town, encountering not just the outside world, but an astonishingly strange one at that.\n[1998-07-19 23:00:00] Grandmother's kitchen | This time, as we sat together around the brightly lit table in her kitchen, our shadows cast against the dark windows, a bottle of Absolut vodka placed between us, suddenly she spoke up. She asked, \"What do you think I should do? You know, she’s a wealthy woman. Money is scattered everywhere. She wouldn’t even notice if some of it went missing. So what harm would there be if I took just a little?\" \"You took money?\" I said.\n[1998-07-19 23:01:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She slammed her hand on the tabletop. She said, \"Yes, of course I did. But not much—nothing at all significant to her. She didn’t notice, so what does it matter? She pays too little! Yes, far too little. The wages I get are pitiful. Because I don’t just drive for her—I have to do all sorts of other chores too. So taking a bit more is only fair and reasonable!\" She laughed. \"Just one hundred kroner, only a hundred! When we drove through the city of Bærum, we drew attention. Private cars were rare back then. So we stood out. Yes, people stared at us.\"\n[1998-07-19 23:02:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She chuckled softly. Then sighed. She said, \"Ah yes, life is struggle (fight),\" the old lady said, unable to pronounce the 'F' sound. \"Hehehe.\"\n[1998-07-19 23:05:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She raised her glass to her lips and drank. I followed suit, emptying my glass. I grabbed the bottle and refilled my empty glass, glancing at Henrik Inge, who nodded and drained his own. I poured more into her glass, while Henrik Inge began pouring orange juice—but stopped halfway when it ran out. He shook the carton a few times. I said, \"Another bit?\" She said, \"Yes, another bit.\" Henrik Inge looked at me and said, \"It's empty. Did you buy Sprite?\" I said, \"Yes, I’ll go get a bottle.\"\n[1998-07-19 23:06:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I stood up and walked toward the refrigerator. Besides my three half-liter bottles of Sprite, there was also a 1.5-liter bottle Henrik Inge had bought earlier that day. I lifted the large bottle to show him. I said, \"Did you forget this one?\" \"Truly forgot,\" said Henrik Inge.",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 23:10:00] First-floor bathroom at grandmother's house | I placed the large Sprite bottle on the table and left the room, going downstairs to the bathroom. As I stepped onto the faded carpet beneath the wall on the first floor, only a faint light filtering through the glass in the front door illuminated the space, guiding me into the bathroom. These vast, empty rooms shaped by darkness enveloped me. The bathroom had its familiar whooshing sound—it had been like that for at least thirty years. But the flame of alcohol burned in my head, and I paid no attention to the gloom that might otherwise have filled me. Though I wasn’t directly joyful, I felt elated, uplifted, driven inwardly to keep going like this—even the thought of my father’s death couldn’t shake me. That was merely a dim shadow, close by but ineffective, because life had already taken its place, with all its images and sounds, eagerly chasing after the intoxicating illusion of what was happening. I found myself somewhere among many people, filled with immense joy. I knew it wasn’t real, but it felt real—feeling ruled me.\n[1998-07-19 23:15:00] Grandmother's living room | When I came out of the bathroom, I heard their voices upstairs and quickly climbed the stairs. In the living room, I walked a few steps deeper inside, looking at the spot where he died with a different, more detached mood. That was when it happened—suddenly I had the distinct feeling that he had truly been there. I didn’t see him, not in any visual sense, but I sensed him, fully present, just as he had been during his final days in these rooms. Ah, it was so strange. But I didn’t want to let this moment hold me, perhaps couldn’t let it—because the sensation lasted only an instant before thought reached out its claws and crushed it down.\n[1998-07-19 23:16:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I walked into the kitchen, where everything was exactly as I had left it. Except the drinks had changed color—they now sparkled, filled with countless grayish-white bubbles.\n[1998-07-19 23:20:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Grandmother began telling more stories from her time living in Bærum. This was part of a family myth, yet the ultimate, unexpected twist was something none of us had ever heard before. I knew that initially, Grandmother had been with my grandfather’s older brother, Alf. Grandmother and the elder brother had once been lovers. The two brothers had studied together in Bærum—Alf in natural sciences, my grandfather in economics. After her relationship with Alf ended, Grandmother married my grandfather and moved to Vesfjord. Alf later moved there too, but by then he was married to Solveig. She had suffered from tuberculosis since childhood, one lung collapsed, and remained frail her entire life, unable to bear children. So when they were older, they adopted an Asian girl. Throughout my upbringing, most gatherings and celebrations were hosted by either Alf’s family or my grandparents’ family. They often visited us, and the history between Alf and Grandmother was frequently mentioned—it was no secret. After my grandfather and Solveig passed away, Grandmother and Alf met once a week; every Saturday morning, Grandmother would visit him at his villa in Grim. Nothing shocking about it, though some would smile knowingly—perhaps they really should have been together after all?\n[1998-07-19 23:25:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Now Grandmother began recounting how she first met the two brothers. Alf was outgoing, while my grandfather was more reserved, but it was obvious both were equally interested in this girl from Østfold. My grandfather watched carefully how his older brother proceeded along that path, using his unique wit and humor to win her favor. He whispered to her: He has a ring in his pocket! At this point, Grandmother laughed. \"What did you say?\" I asked, though I perfectly understood what he meant. He has a ring in his pocket! He repeated it. What kind of ring? I said, and then he said, an engagement ring! \"You see, he still thought I wouldn’t understand that!\"\n[1998-07-19 23:26:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Henrik Inge said, \"Did Alf and Solveig get engaged later?\" \"Yes, he got engaged to her. But she lived in Aucity and was ill. He hadn't expected it to last forever either. But in the end, they stayed together anyway!\"\n[1998-07-19 23:28:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She took another sip. Then licked her lips. Then silence, and she sank down again, as she had done many times over the past two days. She sat there with her hands folded, staring ahead. I drained my glass, poured myself another drink, pulled out a cigarette paper, laid a long strip of tobacco inside, smoothed it out, packed it as tightly as possible, rolled the paper a few times, pressed and sealed one end, ran my tongue along the glue, plucked off the stray bits of leaf sticking out, put them back into the tobacco tin, placed the slightly crooked cigarette in my mouth, and lit it with Henrik Inge’s green, almost translucent lighter.\n[1998-07-19 23:30:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Grandmother said, \"The winter your grandfather died, we were about to go on vacation to the south. We had bought the plane tickets, everything was ready.\"\n[1998-07-19 23:31:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I exhaled a puff of smoke from my mouth and looked at her. \"You know, that night he collapsed in the bathroom... I only heard a loud crash from inside. I got up from bed—he was lying on the floor and told me to call an ambulance. After I did what he asked, I sat down, held his hand, and waited for the ambulance to come. Then he said, 'We're going to the south.' And I thought, 'You're certainly going to a different south!'\"\n[1998-07-19 23:32:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She laughed, but as she did so, she lowered her eyes. She repeated, \"You're certainly going to a different south!\" \"Hehe,\" she said, \"Life is one big brawl,\" and this old lady couldn’t pronounce the F sound.\n[1998-07-19 23:33:00] Grandmother's kitchen | We both laughed. Henrik Inge shifted his glass slightly and looked down at the table. \"When you came to Vesfjord, didn't you move here then?\" I didn't want her thinking about Grandfather or Dad's death, so I tried to steer her back to another topic she'd mentioned before.\n[1998-07-19 23:34:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She said, \"Oh no, not here—much farther than Kuholmsveien. We bought this house after the war. Actually, we only bought the plot of land. It was in a great location, the best in Løn—the house has a view, you know. Facing the sea and the city. So high up that no one can see inside. When we bought it, there was another house standing here. Or maybe calling it a house is generous. Hahaha. It was more like a shack, a storage hut. Two men lived here, if I remember correctly. Yes, exactly... Well, all they did was drink. The first time we came to look at the place—I remember it clearly—there were bottles everywhere! As soon as we walked in, bottles in the hallway, on the stairs, in the living room, and the kitchen too. Everywhere! Some places were so full of bottles you couldn't even step. That's why we got the place very cheap. We tore the house down and built this one. There was no garden originally—just a rocky slope, a broken-down cabin against the hillside. That's what we bought back then.\" \"So you must have spent a lot of time on the garden?\" I said.\n[1998-07-19 23:34:30] Grandmother's kitchen | \"Ah yes, you're absolutely right. Oh yes, yes. Those plum trees outside—you know, I brought them from my parents' home in Østfold. They're really old now. They don't look the same as they used to.\" \"I remember how we often carried home bags full of plums,\" Henrik Inge said. \"I remember too,\" I said. \"Do they still bear fruit?\" Henrik Inge asked. \"They do, I think,\" Grandmother said. \"Maybe not as much as before, but...\"\n[1998-07-19 23:34:40] Grandmother's kitchen | I picked up the wine bottle—now only half full—and refilled my glass. I wiped away a drop clinging to the rim with my thumb, put my finger in my mouth and sucked it clean, while at the far end of the table Grandmother opened a tobacco tin, pinched some into her cigarette roller. It probably isn't strange that Grandmother sees her own trajectory as now complete, including everything that's happened here. Because no matter how terrible and unbearable her life may have been in these final years, that suffering was only a small part of the difficulties she's endured. When she looks at Dad, in her eyes he is infant, child, teenager, adult man—all his traits and personal qualities condensed in a single glance. She sees him passed out drunk on her sofa, defecating and urinating, but that is just a brief moment; compared to the accumulated time she's spent with him over the years, it cannot form a full picture. I think this house is another example. The original house filled with bottles was itself a 'bottle house,' but this house is her home—a place where she's spent the last forty years of her life. The bottles scattered everywhere can no longer hold any meaning for her.\n[1998-07-19 23:34:50] Grandmother's kitchen | Perhaps it's simply that her own drunken mind can no longer think clearly? In that case, she concealed it well, except for a noticeable resurgence of youthfulness, a sign that she indulged in her own mannerisms. On the other hand, I'm not necessarily the most reliable judge when it comes to assessing anything. The stimulation of alcohol kept revealing more light, as if clearing up more and more questions in my mind. I began swallowing the wine almost as easily as juice, only to realize it was a bottomless pit.\n[1998-07-19 23:34:55] Grandmother's kitchen | After I drank a glass of Sprite, I picked up the Absolut Vodka bottle and placed it on the windowsill, just blocking Grandmother’s line of sight. \"What are you doing?!\" Henrik Inge said. \"You put the liquor bottle on the windowsill!\" Grandmother said.\n[1998-07-19 23:34:58] Grandmother's kitchen | I blushed, confused, grabbed the bottle, and put it back on the table. Grandmother began to laugh. Henrik Inge laughed too. \"He put the hard liquor bottle on the windowsill!\" \"Obviously, the neighbors must have seen us sitting here drinking!\" \"Yes, yes,\" I said, \"I didn't think about that at all.\" \"No, one should say it that way!\" Grandmother said, wiping away tears of laughter from her eyes. \"Hehehe!\"\n[1998-07-19 23:34:59] Grandmother's kitchen | In this house, people had always been extremely careful to prevent others from looking inside, meticulously ensuring everything visible was blurred or concealed—clothing, gardens, exterior walls, cars, even children’s behavior. Placing a liquor bottle on the windowsill would expose everything happening indoors; anyone approaching could easily tell what we were up to. That’s why they, and later I as well, burst into laughter like that.\n[1998-07-19 23:35:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I felt the light from the sky fall onto the small hill across the road, casting a dim glow through the dazzling kitchen lights onto the path, where our three submarine-like bluish-gray shadows stretched out. It was supposed to be a night exactly like this—one profoundly dark. I noticed Henrik Inge was beginning to slur his words—a sign invisible to someone who didn’t know him, but I caught it. When he got drunk, he always started this way: first mumbled speech, then increasingly nasal tones, until finally passing out completely and collapsing in an instant—something almost predictable. My own drunkenness was less obvious, mostly an internal shift. I usually remained articulate and precise in speech, which was problematic because people couldn’t tell how drunk I really was. Since I walked and spoke nearly as usual, there was never any excuse later for whatever reckless things I might have said or done. Instead, wildness and intensity grew stronger within me, unchecked by unconsciousness or social friction, continuing deeper into a state crystalline, empty, and primal. I loved it. I loved this feeling—it was the best I could feel. Yet it never brought me anything good. A day or days later, it would cling tightly to recklessness like stupidity, something I deeply despised inside myself. But when I was drunk, I couldn’t see the future or reflect on the past—I existed only in the present. That’s why I wanted to stay there, for my world to shine brilliantly amid the unbearable, torturous banality.\n[1998-07-19 23:35:10] Grandmother's kitchen | I turned and glanced at the wall clock. Twenty-three thirty-five. Then I looked at Henrik Inge. I saw he looked tired. His eyes were smaller, with slight redness around the sockets. His glass was empty. Just don’t let him think about going to bed! I wouldn’t want to sit here alone with Grandmother.\n[1998-07-19 23:35:20] Grandmother's kitchen | I said, \"Another drink?\" nodding toward the bottle on the table. He said, \"Hmm, maybe just a little, but this is the last one. We have to get up early tomorrow.\" I said, \"Oh? Why?\" He said, \"We’ve got an appointment at nine, don’t you remember?\"\n[1998-07-19 23:35:30] Grandmother's kitchen | I slapped my forehead—an old gesture I hadn’t done since high school. I said, \"But that’s no problem, it’s just an appointment.\"\n[1998-07-19 23:35:40] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw Grandmother watching us. I thought, please don’t ask where we’re going! The word 'funeral director' would surely break the spell and drive away this fragile joy. Then we’d be sitting here again—just a mother who lost her son and two children who lost their father.\n[1998-07-19 23:36:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I picked up the bottle and poured Henrik Inge a drink, then refilled my own glass. As I poured, I met Grandmother’s gaze. I heard my own voice: \"Would you like another?\" She said, \"Perhaps, just a small one. It’s getting late, you know.\" I said, \"Yes, late on Earth.\" She said, \"What did you say?\" Henrik Inge said, \"He said 'late on Earth.' It’s a famous line by Mochengdao, a renowned poet.\" I considered asking if she wanted more wine, but I didn’t dare. There was a limit here, tied to propriety—and we’d already crossed it long ago. Why did he say that? Was he trying to elevate me? Damn it, what a stupid thing to say. 'Late on Earth'...\n[1998-07-19 23:37:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I nodded. Henrik Inge said, \"Grete Lundnes is about to publish a book soon.\" Grandmother said, \"Is that so?\" \"Yes, you said so yourself—I heard someone mention it. I think it was Marivik? You’re publishing a book.\"\n[1998-07-19 23:37:10] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw her raise the wine glass to her lips and drink. I did the same. I wondered—was this merely imagination, or had darkness already filled her eyes again?\n[1998-07-19 23:38:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I took another sip of wine. I said, 'So you didn't live here during the war then?' She pointed behind her and said, 'No, not right after the war ended. We moved here several years later. During the war we lived out there.'\n[1998-07-19 23:40:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I said, 'But what exactly happened back then? I mean, during the war?' She said, 'Oh, it was almost like normal life, you know. A bit difficult to get food, but not much difference really. The Oswick people were ordinary folks, just like us. We even got to know some of them. After the war ended, we went down to visit them.' 'In Oswick?' 'Yes, yes. When they had to leave here in May 1945, they called and said we could come take all sorts of things they'd left behind if we wanted. They gave us their best wine. And a radio. And many other things.'\n[1998-07-19 23:41:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I said, 'They left everything behind—where exactly?' Grandmother said, 'In a gravel pile up on the hillside. They called and told us precisely where to find it. That same night we went up there, and everything was there just as they described. They were friendly, yes, truly they were.' I'd never heard before about receiving gifts from the Oswick people before their surrender. But the Oswick people had actually been to their house.",

    "text": "[1998-07-19 23:41:10] Grandmother's kitchen | I imagined Grandmother and Grandfather climbing up to that hillside gravel pile one night in May 1945, searching around for Oswick people’s liquor?\n[1998-07-19 23:45:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw Grandmother lean forward and peer out the window. She sighed and sat back in her chair, placing her hands on her knees, looking at us. She said, 'Who could that be at this hour? It's so good having you here, children.' A beam of car headlights swept across the garden, shining on the wall beneath the window for several seconds, until the car completed a full turn and slowly drove away down the narrow lane below.\n[1998-07-19 23:46:00] Grandmother's kitchen | A long silence. I saw Grandmother take another sip of wine. She said suddenly, her eyes warm as she looked into Henrik Inge's, 'Do you remember when you used to stay here? When your father came to see you, he had a beard, and you ran up the stairs shouting, \"That man isn't my dad!\" Hahaha! \"That's not Dad!\"... You were such a funny little thing back then, you know?' Henrik Inge said, 'I remember it very clearly.'\n[1998-07-19 23:47:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw her bend her head forward with laughter, wiping the corner of her eye with her index finger. She said, 'And then there was the time we listened to the \"Nine Hours\" program here, when they were talking to the owner of Leivik's oldest horse. Do you remember? You said, \"Dad, you're as old as Leivik's oldest horse!\"'\n[1998-07-19 23:48:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She looked at me. I nodded. She said, 'And you—do you remember that time you stayed with us alone at the holiday cabin? One morning we found you sitting on the stairs crying. When we asked why, you said, \"I'm so lonely.\" You were only eight, you know!'\n[1998-07-19 23:49:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I remembered that summer when Mom and Dad went on vacation to Oswick. Henrik Inge was staying with his grandparents in Sørbygda, and I was here, in Vesfjord. What do I actually remember? A great distance from Grandfather and Grandmother, a rather distant relationship. Suddenly I became part of their daily lives. They seemed even stranger than before, because there was nothing or no one between us to carry communication. One morning I found a tiny insect in my milk and refused to drink it. Grandmother said I shouldn't be so picky—just fish it out. That's how it is in nature. Her voice sounded a bit sharp. I drank the milk anyway, feeling sick all day. Why did this particular memory surface now? Nothing else? There must have been more, surely?\n[1998-07-19 23:50:00] Grandmother's kitchen | Oh, by the way, Mom and Dad sent me a postcard of Bayern Munich. When they finally came home, the gifts they brought were: a gold-and-red football for Henrik Inge, and a green-and-red one for me. How deeply I longed for such a postcard—and how overjoyed I was to finally have it in my hands! Those colors… ah, my heart feels as joyful as if newly born…\n[1998-07-19 23:51:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw her looking at Henrik Inge. She smiled. Grandmother said, \"Once you stood on these stairs and shouted up to me, 'Are you above or below?' I answered, 'Below,' and you yelled back, 'Why aren't you above?'\"\n[1998-07-19 23:52:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She said, \"Yes, there were so many funny things… After you moved to Tybakken, you went straight to knock on your neighbor’s door asking if any children lived there. You asked, 'Do little kids live here?' Hahaha!\"\n[1998-07-19 23:55:00] Grandmother's kitchen | After the laughter had completely faded, I saw her sitting there quietly chuckling to herself for a while, then beginning to roll another cigarette in her rolling machine. The outer end of the rolled cigarette was empty. When she lit it with a lighter, the flame suddenly flared upward. A small flake of ash drifted down onto the floor. Once the tobacco caught fire, tiny dark red sparks appeared, glowing brighter each time she drew on the filter.\n[1998-07-19 23:56:00] Grandmother's kitchen | She said, \"But now you've both grown up—it's so strange. It feels like yesterday you were just little children here…\"\n[1998-07-20 15:00:00] Vesfjord Chapel | He lay on a table in the center of the room. The sky was overcast, casting gray light into the chapel. Outside the window, a lawn mower slowly circled across the grass. His eyes and mouth were closed. He wore a white shirt on top and black trousers below. I myself first saw a dead body when I was nearly thirty years old. It was a summer afternoon in July 1998, inside a small chapel in Vesfjord. My father had died. My brother and I were there together. The funeral attendant stepped out first, leaving us alone with the deceased. We stood several meters away from the body, staring at it. I thought this was the first time I could examine this face without difficulty—yet it felt almost unbearable. It felt like I was violating him. At the same time, I felt an intense hunger, a greedy need—I kept having to look again and again at this corpse, which only days ago had been my father. I knew this face well; I had grown up with it. Though in recent years I hadn’t seen it as often as before, hardly a night had passed without dreaming of it. I knew this face—but not like this. The dark, yellowish skin and the stiff expression made it look like a piece of wood carved from a tree. This tree-like face evoked no desire to come near. What I saw was no longer a person, but an object resembling one. And yet he came from among us—he had once been one of us—and now he still lingered within me, like a veil of life draped over death.\n[1998-07-20 15:05:00] Vesfjord Chapel | I saw Henrik Inge slowly move toward the other end of the table. I didn’t look directly at him; I only noticed his movement when I raised my gaze outward. The gardener operating the lawn mower kept turning his head to check that the wheels followed the edge of the previously mowed strip. Grass clippings not collected into the bag swirled through the air above him. Some must have stuck beneath the machine, because damp clumps of grass were being squeezed out at regular intervals, appearing much darker green than the surrounding lawn. Further along the gravel path behind him came three people walking with their heads bowed, one wearing a red coat that stood out vividly against the green grass and gray sky. On the road beyond, cars glided steadily forward, heading toward the city center.\n[1998-07-20 15:06:00] Vesfjord Chapel | I immediately took a step backward. Suddenly, outside the chapel wall, the roar of the lawn mower engine burst forth. I imagined whether this sudden loud noise might make Dad open his eyes—the image was so vivid and real that I immediately stepped backward.\n[1998-07-20 15:06:10] Vesfjord Chapel | I saw Henrik Inge glance at me, a faint smile playing on his lips. Do I think the dead can come back to life? That this tree might turn back into a man?\n[1998-07-20 15:07:00] Vesfjord Chapel | In the next moment, another sob welled up and escaped me. It was truly a shocking moment. But when my emotions settled, I realized clearly that he was truly gone—no matter how loud the sounds around me, no matter how wildly my mind conjured images, he remained motionless. Then a sudden surge of freedom rose in my chest, as uncontrollable as the waves of grief I’d felt earlier. And just as involuntarily, in the next moment, another sob welled up and escaped me.\n[1998-07-20 15:08:00] Vesfjord Chapel | I met Henrik Inge's gaze and smiled. I saw him walk over and stand quietly beside me. The sensation of his closeness and nearness flooded through my entire body at once. How happy I was that he stood there—so happy that I had to struggle hard not to lose control again and ruin everything in this moment. That meant thinking about something else, forcing my mind to focus on things entirely unrelated to this.\n[1998-07-20 15:09:00] Vesfjord Chapel | Someone was rummaging around in the next room. The sound was faint, but it broke the atmosphere we had been standing in—a hazy, dreamlike feeling, like those half-real, half-imagined sounds from the waking world that intrude into dreams when one is asleep. I felt as though those half-real, half-imagined sounds from the waking world were slipping into a dream while one sleeps.\n[1998-07-20 15:10:00] Vesfjord Chapel | I looked down at Dad. I saw his fingers interlaced over his abdomen, the edges of the index fingers stained dark yellow with nicotine, just like old, discolored wallpaper. The skin over his knuckles was deeply and unnaturally wrinkled, now appearing artificial rather than natural. Then I looked at his face. It remained unreadable—though he lay there peaceful and still, it wasn’t blank; traces lingered that I could only describe as expressions of will. I realized I had always tried to determine what expression was on his face, always watching it while trying to interpret it.\n[1998-07-20 15:11:00] Vesfjord Chapel | I turned toward Henrik Inge. I nodded. “Shall we go now?” I nodded. But now it’s closed.\n[1998-07-20 15:12:00] Vesfjord Chapel | I saw the funeral director waiting for us in the outer room. After stepping out, I left the door open. Though I knew it was improper, I didn’t want to leave Dad alone inside.",

    "text": "[1998-07-20 15:20:00] Parking lot outside the chapel | We shook hands with the funeral director, discussed possible arrangements for the funeral in a few days, then stepped outside and walked toward the parking lot, each lighting a cigarette. Henrik Inge stood close to the car, while I sat down on the edge of a stone block. Rain drifted through the air. The trees behind the chapel bent under an increasingly strong wind. For several seconds, the deafening rustle of leaves drowned out the sound of traffic from the far end of the field. Then both fell silent.\n[1998-07-20 15:21:00] Parking lot outside the chapel | He laughed. “Ah, kind of unbelievable,” said Henrik Inge. “Yeah,” I said, “but I’m glad we did it.” “Same here. I had to see it to believe it.” “Do you believe it now?” I asked. He laughed. “Don’t you?”\n[1998-07-20 15:22:00] Parking lot outside the chapel | Instead of smiling back at him as I intended, I began to sob again. I pressed my hands hard against my face and lowered my head. Wave after wave of crying made my body tremble. When they finally subsided, I lifted my head and glanced at him, offering a faint smile. I said, “It’s just like when we were kids—me crying, and you watching.”\n[1998-07-20 15:23:00] Parking lot outside the chapel | He searched for my eyes. “Are you sure…” he said, searching my gaze, “that you’ll be okay being alone now?” “Of course,” I said, “no problem.” “I can call home and say I won’t come back.” “You drive home. Everything’s already arranged.”\n[1998-07-20 15:24:00] Parking lot outside the chapel | He dropped his cigarette, pulled out his car keys from his pocket. I stood up and took a few steps forward, but not close enough for a handshake or embrace. He opened the car door, got in, glanced upward as he inserted the key into the ignition, and the engine roared to life. “OK. I’m off now.”\n[1998-07-20 15:24:30] Parking lot outside the small chapel | He said, \"Well then, goodbye.\" \"Goodbye. Drive carefully. Give my regards to the family!\"\n[1998-07-20 15:25:00] Parking lot outside the small chapel | He closed the car door, backed up slightly, paused, fastened his seatbelt, shifted gears, and slowly drove toward the main road. After that, I started walking forward. Suddenly his rear lights came on—he reversed back toward me. His hand reached out from the rolled-down window. He said, \"You'd better take this.\"\n[1998-07-20 15:25:30] Parking lot outside the small chapel | He said, \"It makes no sense for me to carry it all the way to Zhenpine—better to leave it here. OK?\" I said, \"OK.\" This was the brown envelope handed to us by the funeral home attendant.\n[1998-07-20 15:26:00] Parking lot outside the small chapel | The car window closed. I stood motionless until his car turned onto the main road and disappeared. Then I slipped the envelope into the inner pocket of my jacket and began walking toward town. He said, \"See you next time.\" In the final seconds, soaring, stirring music rang out across the parking lot, sounding abruptly as if coming from beneath water. This was an impulse I’d had since childhood; if I didn’t do it, misfortune would befall me.\n[1998-07-20 16:30:00] Vesfjord Street | After seeing Henrik Inge drive off toward Zhenpine, as I walked back to grandmother’s house, the first thing that came to mind was the blood. How could there possibly have been blood? Grandmother had said she found him dead in the chair—apart from that, the most believable explanation was that he’d suffered a heart attack while sitting there, perhaps even while asleep. Yet the funeral home didn’t just mention blood—they said there was a lot of blood. And the nose—his nasal bone was broken. So was his death at the scene something different in nature? Did he stand up, in agony, and crash into the brick fireplace? Fall onto the floor? But if so, why were there no traces of blood on the walls or floor? Why hadn’t grandmother mentioned any blood? Something must have happened—not just blood—that made it impossible for him to simply pass away quietly. Did she wipe away the blood and then forget all about it? Why would she do that? She didn’t wipe anything away or hide anything—I saw no sign that she felt the need to. Equally strange is how quickly I myself forgot about it. Ah, but maybe that isn’t so strange—there are many other things to deal with now. Still, once I returned to grandmother’s house, I’d have to call Henrik Inge immediately. We needed to contact the doctor responsible for transferring his body to the hospital. He might tell us exactly what had happened.\n[1998-07-20 16:40:00] Vesfjord Street | I walked as fast as I could up the gentle slope ahead, as if rushing against time to arrive on schedule, alongside a lush green hedge growing densely within a yard fence. At the same time, another thought seemed to brew in my mind—the desire to prolong my time alone as much as possible, even considering stopping at a café to read a newspaper or something else. Being with Henrik Inge and staying with grandmother was one thing, but facing grandmother alone was quite another. Henrik Inge knew how to handle her. Their easy, humorous tone, similar to the approach used by Erling and Marivik, was—putting it mildly—a method I had never employed. During that year of gymnastics training, because I lived nearby, I spent a lot of time with them. It felt as though my attitude and behavior caused some unpleasantness, that I brought along ways they didn’t want, a suspicion later confirmed in some way months afterward when Mom told me grandmother had called saying I shouldn’t visit them so often. I could handle most accusations, but this one I couldn’t accept. Even if they didn’t welcome me, they were still my grandparents, and I was so shocked that I couldn’t hold back—I began sobbing right in front of Mom. From her perspective, she was also very upset, but what could she do? At the time, I couldn’t understand these things, thinking only that they simply didn’t like me. From then on, I began wondering what aspects of me might have made me unlikable. I couldn’t picture it, couldn’t step into their shoes. I carried my teenage habits into that house and stubbornly held on to them, assuming they’d eventually adapt. This created imbalance, since their habit was never to force me into anything, so ultimately they called my mother. My visits were always driven by need—either concrete, like going there to eat, since I arrived after school and before training, meaning I wouldn’t eat until eight or nine at night, or money-related, since only afternoon buses were free for students, and I couldn’t always afford tickets. Food and money—they didn’t object to providing these, but what angered them was probably my sense of entitlement. So they had no choice: meals and bus fare ceased being free gifts. But there were other factors too—the second reason was the issue of our relationship itself. They no longer wanted to maintain any connection between us. Back then I didn’t understand this. Now I do. My behavior there was to fully approach them with my entire life and thoughts—it was part of the same pattern. They couldn’t, perhaps wouldn’t, reciprocate that closeness, and I accepted some of it anyway. Ironically, during all those visits, I constantly thought of them, always saying what I believed they’d want to hear—even deeply personal, private matters, which I shared not because I needed to speak them, but because I thought it would benefit them to hear.",

    "text": "[1998-07-20 16:50:00] Long Avenue | Now I was walking along Long Avenue, a long afternoon procession of cars passing beside me, driving past tree trunks darkened by dust and exhaust fumes. Compared to the thick canopy above, full of lush, delicate leaves, these trunks stood heavy as stone pillars. This is the most unpleasant thing, I thought, yet still I consider myself a good judge of people. All I can do is put myself in others’ places—that’s my strength. Understanding others. But myself remains more of a mystery. Ah, how foolish! I laughed. Immediately I looked up to check whether the people in the cars beside me could see me. But no one did. Everyone was absorbed in themselves.\n[1998-07-20 16:55:00] Long Avenue | I stopped to light a cigarette. I can’t keep pretending ignorance. No lying, no acting. That’s why I was glad to let Henrik Inge deal with grandmother. But now I must face her personally. As I continued walking, for some reason I began to feel uplifted. Was it because of the brick facades to my left, originally white but blackened by exhaust? Or the trees along the avenue? These still, leaf-covered giants, carrying generation upon generation of endless foliage, these living beings bathed in air? Because whenever my eyes fell upon them, joy always welled up inside me.\n[1998-07-20 17:00:00] Long Avenue | I took an especially deep inhale, flicked off the silvery-gray ash from the cigarette, and walked on. I thought of two earlier periods: first, visiting here as a child with grandmother and grandfather in Vesfjord, when every tiny detail of this cityscape appeared like scenes from a fairy tale; then, when I lived here at around ten years old. I saw the pharmacy and remembered once going there with Henrik Inge and grandmother; high snowbanks along the roadside outside, snow falling, her wearing a long coat and fur hat, standing in line at the window, the pharmacist in a white coat moving back and forth inside. Occasionally she turned to see what we were doing. Her gaze wasn’t cold, but at least emotionless—after the first glance, she smiled, her eyes suddenly warm. The change happened in an instant. When Henrik Inge and I drove to the small chapel, the surroundings hadn’t stirred any memories in me, but now they surged powerfully. I’d been here a few years ago, and since then I’ve observed how these impressions come flooding back, partly because they connect with certain fragments of my memory world, partly linked to others, simultaneously existing across three distinct, separate time periods.\n[1998-07-20 17:05:00] Long Avenue | Even a rusty, crooked clothesline behind a garden, even the rotting apples on the ground beneath a tree, even the boat wrapped in tarpaulin with its damp support poles sticking out, and the yellowed, flattened grass underneath. I looked at the sloping road leading up to Long Bridge, remembering how grandfather usually cycled home along it in the afternoons. How different he looked outside! As if the slight swaying motion on the uphill ride was the reason—not only the bicycle he rode, but the man himself: for an instant he was just any elderly Vesfjord man in a coat and cap, and in the next moment he was grandfather again. I looked down at the rooftops spreading across the residential area below, recalling how, at sixteen, I had walked through them at night, filled with emotional turbulence. And so everything I saw now appeared splendidly beautiful.\n[1998-07-20 17:10:00] Long Grove Avenue | I saw the grassy slope behind the buildings on the other side of the road, and I thought of a blue, biting winter day when we had sled down it with Grandmother. The snow in the sunlight was wet yet dazzlingly bright, like the intense light high in the mountains, so that the city below us looked strange, everything happening there laid completely bare—people walking along the streets beneath us, cars passing by, the man clearing snow from the driveway outside a local company on the other side of the road, other children playing with sleds, as if there were no other place to gather, just circling here under the sky. As I walked down, all of this came alive inside me, everything around me entered my awareness and made me reflect, but only superficially, only at the outermost layer of consciousness, because Dad is dead, and this fills me with sorrow deep within, an emotion that radiates through all my thoughts and feelings. He can be found in these memories too, but he is insignificant there, which is truly strange—there is no trace of any thought about him.\n[1998-07-20 17:15:00] Long Grove Avenue | Back in the early 70s, Dad walked a few meters ahead of me along the sidewalk—we were going to the kiosk to buy a pipe cleaner, then on to Grandmother and Grandfather’s. He lifted his chin as if smiling quietly to himself; I knew that kind of joy of his. Or Dad at the bank, one hand holding his wallet, using the fingers of the other to push his hair back, looking at his gleaming reflection in the glass at the counter. Or Dad getting into the car and driving into town. In these memories, I didn’t feel him as someone significant. That is to say, I felt something at the time I remembered them, not now, as I think of them again. With the thought that he is dead, the relationship with him has changed. In this thought, he is everything—it feels natural—and the thought itself is everything. So when I go there, on a day with soft, misty rain, it’s as if I’ve entered another world. Nothing outside this world holds any meaning. I look, I think, and then what I see and what I think recedes: it has nothing to do with them. It has nothing to do with anything. Only Dad, that he is dead—that’s the only thing it’s connected to.\n[1998-07-20 17:20:00] Across from Pharmacy Street | As I walked, the brown envelope—the one containing the items he had with him when he died—remained constantly in my mind. I stopped outside the general business company across from Pharmacy Street, leaning slightly toward the wall, and took out the envelope. I saw my father’s name written on it. I stepped a few paces closer to the wall, shaking the things in my hand. His ring, some jewelry, a few coins, a needle. That was all. An old woman pulling a wheeled shopping bag with one hand and leading a small white dog with the other glanced at me as she came out the door. I turned each item over in my palm, one by one. A strange feeling. I expected the surname Grete Lundnes. But unless there was a spelling error, the ridiculous and pretentious new name was the one used at his death. The objects themselves seemed utterly ordinary. Yet he carried them with him—his ring must have been on his finger, the jewelry a necklace around his neck—and after his death, they acquired a special aura. Death and gold. They filled me with a sense of dread. The fear I stood there with was the same fear of death I had as a child—not fear of dying myself, but fear of the dead.\n[1998-07-20 17:25:00] Kiosk/Street | I put the items back into the envelope, slipped it into my pocket, ran across the street between two cars, went into the kiosk to buy a newspaper and a Lion chocolate bar, and ate the chocolate as I walked the last few hundred meters to the house.",

    "text": "[1998-07-20 17:30:00] Grandmother's Hallway | I smelled the familiar, nostalgic scent still lingering there, the same one I’d known since childhood. I remember Grandmother unexpectedly coming to our house—I had no idea she was visiting. When I came home from school and caught the scent in the hallway, I thought a burglar had broken in, because there were no signs of a guest: no car parked in the driveway, no coats or shoes in the hall. Only the smell. Our house never had its own distinct, personal scent. Even after everything that’s happened, even after twenty years, even after so much has changed, the smell in the house remains the same—it strikes me as so strange. You might suppose it has to do with habits: the same soap, the same detergent, the same perfume and aftershave, the same meals cooked the same way, the same daily routines... But when all former habits in a house have ceased... how can the scent remain unchanged? Is this smell I detect every time I enter—a smell infused and imprinted into the walls by forty years of life—exactly that?\n[1998-07-20 17:35:00] Grandmother's Cellar | I didn’t go upstairs to her right away, but opened the door to the cellar and descended a few steps down the narrow staircase. I held onto the banister. I felt the cold, dark air rush toward me; the only light came from a small porthole-like window set into the wall below. It felt like condensed air, or perhaps the house itself concentrated—exactly how I remembered it. Together with the scent of old walls and earth, this compound odor formed a distinct underground fragrance, while all other smells mingled together as contrasting layers rising up with it. I had gone down into the cellar no more than three or four times... but how often I had stood in the hallway, watching Grandmother come up from below... The perspective seemed elusive, the sense of space dissolving momentarily, vanishing entirely before me. Then, just as suddenly, everything became sharply clear again: I was here, the window was there, the garden was there, the entrance to the house was there.\n[1998-07-20 17:40:00] Grandmother's Staircase | I stood there for a moment, looking out the window... then turned and walked up into the hallway, hung my jacket on a hanger in the closet, and glanced at myself in the mirror hanging on the wall beside the stairs. As I climbed the stairs, I deliberately stepped heavily, so Grandmother would hear I had arrived. I saw the circle of tiredness still lingering around my eyes.\n[1998-07-20 17:42:00] Grandmother's Kitchen | When I entered, I saw her lift her head quickly, in a birdlike motion. I nodded. I saw her turn her head away. I walked a few steps into the room and placed the newspaper I’d bought on the table. I heard her say: “Ah, it’s you. Everything alright?” I said: “Yes, everything’s fine.” She said: “Good.” I saw her sitting at the kitchen table, in the same posture as when we had left her just hours earlier. Before her sat a cup of coffee, an ashtray, and a plate scattered with crumbs from the roll she had eaten. I thought she might have forgotten where I had gone, but I couldn’t be sure, so I answered her in a tone suitably serious for the situation.\n[1998-07-20 17:45:00] Grandmother's Kitchen | I took a cup from the cupboard and went to the stove, feeling the kettle with my fingers. It had long gone cold. I heard her say: “Don’t you want some coffee?” I said: “Yes, I’d like some.” She said: “The pot’s on the stove.” Something in her tone made me glance at her. She had never spoken to me like that before. Strangely, she hadn’t changed much, not like I had. In the final period, she had spoken to Dad in exactly this way. Now she was speaking to him, not to me... that sent a chill through me. But I couldn’t let myself be disturbed by it.\n[1998-07-20 17:48:00] Grandmother's Kitchen | I saw Grandmother whistle softly, tapping a rhythm with her fingers on the tabletop. I’ve seen photos of her from the early 30s—she was beautiful then... Even in the late 50s, as a middle-aged woman with three children, people could still use the word beautiful to describe her. When I grew up, she had a distinctive presence of her own... an elderly woman from a middle-class family who took excellent care of herself... energetic, warm, approachable, healthy. Until just a few years ago, that’s exactly who she had remained. Then something changed in her... she lost herself... She hasn’t done this in my memory for a long time. Seeing her like this brought a slight comfort, because otherwise she would seem to have changed too drastically... I wasn’t aware of it... Now I see that what dwells within her body is sharp and hard, just like her thin, withered frame.\n[1998-07-20 17:55:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I saw her use one hand to remove the tobacco stuck to her lips. Then she looked over at me. I walked toward the sink with the kettle in my hand. I saw her smile, brushing a bit of crumb from her knee. I spoke as I turned on the tap. She said, \"Should I brew some coffee for you too?\" I said, \"Is there something wrong with that coffee?\" She said, \"It's not very hot.\" I said, \"I'll make a fresh pot.\" She said, \"You mean, it's not very hot.\" She said, \"I must be getting a bit confused again—I must have been mixing things up in my head just now.\" I said, \"The coffee isn't really cold, it's just that I prefer it scalding hot.\" I saw it, but I was powerless to do anything about it, unable to build a bridge across it, unable to help or comfort her. I could only watch, and that made every minute I spent with her unbearably tense. The only way is to keep moving... Is she angry with me? No.\n[1998-07-20 18:00:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I poured out the coffee grounds, letting the water jet hit the bottom of the sink until all the residue disappeared down the drain. Then I refilled the kettle with water. I saw the inside walls of the kettle were almost completely blackened, and the outer surface bore greasy fingerprints. I know 'getting confused'—that's the family's euphemism for dementia. When Grandfather's brother Leif started 'getting confused'... then his other brother Arve... Grandfather himself... It's a hereditary issue in the family; their mother hadn't been free of confusion in her final years either... According to my father, she died falling down the steep attic stairs. Whether this is truly the case, I don't know. My father can lie about anything. My intuition tells me it's not true, but I've found no way to verify it.\n[1998-07-20 18:05:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I carried the kettle over to the electric stove and placed it on the burner. I pressed the safety switch, one of those found everywhere in the kitchen. I stood there with arms crossed, gazing out the window at the peak of the steep hill... Then I turned back to her. I heard Grandmother say, \"So, where is Henrik Inge?\" I said, \"He went to Zhenpine today, back to his home. He'll come back later… Friday.\" She said, \"Ah yes,\" nodding to herself, \"He went to Zhenpine.\" The bottom of the kettle began crackling with little popping sounds. I saw that white house standing there like a throne base. I thought of how throughout my entire life I'd always looked up at that white house, yet never once had I seen a single person inside it or around it.\n[1998-07-20 18:10:00] Grandmother's kitchen | When she grabbed the tobacco tin and the small red-and-black cigarette roller, I saw her yank the handle with unexpected force, pull out the paper filled with tobacco, light it, brush ash from her knee, and sit staring into the air before her. She lifted her head and looked at me. She spoke without raising her head: \"But you're here, aren't you?\" I said, \"Yes, I've been right here all along.\" She said, \"Good.\" I said, \"I think I should go on cleaning and scrubbing. I've got to work late tonight, make a few calls.\" She said, \"But are you so busy you can't sit here a moment?\" I said, \"Well, not exactly.\" It was clearly evident she wanted me to stay, which pleased me, though I understood it wasn't specifically me she needed, but simply someone being there.\n[1998-07-20 18:15:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I firmly pressed the kettle onto the burner—the boiling sound grew louder—then moved it aside, poured in some coffee, stirred it with a fork, slammed it back onto the burner, and finally set the kettle on the wire trivet on the table. I poured coffee into the cups... I smiled. Grandmother smiled too. She pushed her cup a few centimeters across the table. She picked up the yellow carton of cream and poured a little into her coffee. I said, \"Coffee's ready, now let it steep a bit more for flavor.\" Grandmother sighed, \"Ah yes, life is a struggle, says this old lady who can't pronounce the F sound.\" I said, \"Do you want coffee?\" She said, \"A bit weak, but… yes, I'd like some.\" When her cup was half full, she said, \"Thank you.\" She said, \"Where did Henrik Inge go?\" I said, \"He went to Zhenpine, back to his home.\" She said, \"Right. That's where he was going, yes. When will he return?\" I said, \"I think, Friday.\" The water in the kettle emitted a hissing sound. I saw the fingerprints we hadn't wiped off the coffee pot—surely including my father's. Before my eyes appeared his nicotine-stained fingers. There was something undignified, incongruous here. Those stained fingers, signs of mundane, trivial life, could not be compared to the solemnity of death. Perhaps I wished the two could coincide. Then that vacant, unfocused look returned. After speaking, my mind felt lighter, emptied out—though more yellow than black, with tiny coffee grounds floating on the water's surface.",

    "text": "[1998-07-20 19:30:00] Grandmother's living room/kitchen | I rinsed the bucket in the sink, refilled it with water, added green soap, put on rubber gloves, grabbed the rag from the counter with one hand, lifted the bucket with the other, and walked into the farthest corner of the living room. Outside, the sky was beginning to darken slightly. Closest to the ground, in the fading light, a faint pale blue hue was visible. Though thin, the color remained distinct, gradually overcoming the night with a kind of reverse force... Yet in the southwest outside, one could still see the lighthouse at the fjord mouth, where daylight still held its ground, unchallenged. A few burning red clouds there seemed to glow with their own power, even though the sun itself had already hidden away.\n[1998-07-20 19:30:00] Grandmother's living room | After a while, I saw Grandmother come in. She turned on the TV and sat down in a chair. I said, \"Is it the news now?\" She said, \"Certainly, don't you want to come and watch?\" I said, \"I do, I just need to finish this job first.\" The volume of advertisements was always much higher than the programs—they not only filled the entire living room but also created a faint echo against the walls.\n[1998-07-20 19:47:00] Grandmother's kitchen/living room | After I had cleaned the entire stretch of wainscoting along one wall, I wrung out the rag, walked into the kitchen, poured the water into the sink, draped the rag over the bucket, stood motionless for a moment, then opened the cupboard, pushed aside the tissues inside, took out a bottle of vodka. From the cabinet above the sink, I found two glasses, opened the fridge and took out a bottle of Sprite, filled one glass completely, mixed vodka into the other, picked up both glasses, and entered the living room. I handed her the glass with vodka, kept the Sprite for myself, and sat down in the chair beside her. I said with a smile, \"I think we can enjoy a little drink.\" Grandmother said, \"That's such a delight—we really can do that.\" On the glass window, I could see a faint reflection of my silhouette—blurry in shape, but with clearly defined brighter and darker areas. I feel terrible, absolutely terrible. My heart is torn to pieces. But I can't do anything about it. She needs this drink. That's all there is to it.\n[1998-07-20 19:51:00] Grandmother's living room | I wish it had at least been whiskey or port! Then I could have served it properly on a tray with a cup of coffee—more dignified, not entirely correct perhaps, but certainly less blunt than simply pouring vodka mixed with Sprite straight into a glass.\n[1998-07-20 19:52:00] Grandmother's living room | I saw how she opened her aged mouth and swallowed the drink in one gulp. Now she sat there holding the glass with both hands. I stood up. She turned her head toward me. I said, \"I'm going to make a few phone calls.\" She said, \"Who are you calling at this hour?\" I said, \"It's only eight o'clock.\" She said, \"Isn't it later?\" I said, \"No. I think I'll call Henrik Inge. And one to Tonje too.\" She said, \"Call Henrik Inge?\" I said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Isn't he here? Oh no, he's not here.\" Then her attention shifted back to the TV, as if I had already left the room. I've decided this shouldn't happen again. It feels like a knife in my heart. Fortunately, she didn't ask for another. Once again, she seemed to be talking to someone else.\n[1998-07-20 19:53:00] Grandmother's kitchen | I pulled out a chair from the dining table, sat down, and dialed Henrik Inge's number. I said, \"I've been thinking about the blood.\" He said, \"Yeah, what was that?\" I said, \"There must have been more to it than what grandmother told us.\" I said, \"He must have fallen or something, hit himself against something hard. His nasal bone is broken, did you see that?\" He said, \"Of course.\" I said, \"We should talk to the people who were here then. Plainly put, we should speak with the doctor.\" Henrik Inge said, \"The funeral home will have his name; shall I call them?\" I said, \"Yes, could you?\" He said, \"I'll do it tomorrow. It's a bit late now. Let's talk again then.\" In the background, I heard Toye screaming, and Marivik Lund scolding him. He had just walked in, and everything was going smoothly.\n[1998-07-20 19:54:00] Grandmother's kitchen / balcony | After hanging up, I dialed Tonje's number. I picked up cigarettes and a lighter from the kitchen table and went outside onto the balcony. From her voice, I could tell she had been waiting for my call. I said I was quite tired and we could talk more tomorrow—she would actually be coming here in a few days anyway. This evening, the bay was crowded with returning boats. The warm air carried the city’s distinctive smell of wood—always so when the wind comes from the north—and beneath me in the garden there was the scent of trees, along with a faint, almost imperceptible trace of the sea. Inside, flickering light came from the television screen. I considered telling her about what had happened here, but sensed a hint of impatience in his voice, which wasn’t surprising—his two-year-old daughter Ylva was waiting upstairs. Even though only hours had passed since we parted, he still showed no sign of ending our conversation, so it would have to be me who did it.\n[1998-07-20 19:55:00] Grandmother's balcony / attic bedroom | I stood at the far end of the balcony by the black iron railing, smoking. When I finished the cigarette, I crushed the butt against the outer wall... Then I went back inside, first checking on my grandmother sitting in the living room, before climbing the stairs up to the attic bedroom. The suitcase beside the bed was open. I took out the cardboard box containing the manuscript, sat on the edge of the bed, opened the lid and tore off the sealing tape... From an inner pocket in the suitcase I found a pencil, picked up the page summarizing proofreading marks, moved further onto the bed, leaned against the headboard, and placed the stack of manuscript pages on my lap. Glowing red ashes drifted like tiny stars down into the garden below... Thinking that a book was actually about to be published, a strong urge rose within me as the title page came into view—what difference could there possibly be between these corrected proofs and my own handwritten manuscript, which I was so used to? I immediately suppressed the thought; I couldn't sit here dwelling on this... Time was pressing, so I planned to read as much as possible these next few evenings, from beginning to end. Until now, I hadn’t had time to read it. With Henrik Inge in Zhenpine and it not yet eight o’clock, I had at least four hours of work ahead, maybe even more.\n[1998-07-20 20:00:00] Grandmother's attic bedroom / drying room | I began reading. A few minutes later, I got off the bed, holding a suit jacket in one hand, looking around for somewhere to hang it... Finally, I left the room and entered the adjacent attic drying room, where I hung them on the clothesline. The two black suits hanging separately on the half-open closet door opposite the bed kept distracting me from proofreading, because as I read, I kept thinking about them—even though I knew they were just clothes, their shadows entered my consciousness, making me imagine them as two living bodies. To make them disappear from sight... There, freely hanging, they looked more like shadows than ever before. I could smell death, but at least now they were out of my field of vision.\n[1998-07-20 20:15:00] Grandmother's attic bedroom | So I went back inside, sat on the bed, and continued working. I lifted my eyes upward. I put down the manuscript, stood up, and walked over to the window. Down on the street far below, a car accelerated rapidly. Sounds from the TV on the first floor floated up. In this empty, silent house, it sounded utterly insane—a flowing madness filling every room. I’ve written a book for my father. I didn’t realize it, but that’s exactly what it is. This book was written for him. Could he really mean so much to me? Ah, yes—he does. I want him to see me.\n[1998-07-20 20:30:00] Grandmother's attic bedroom | I started crying when I began writing the chapter about my dad. As soon as I wrote about him, tears streamed down my cheeks, blurring my vision so badly I could barely see the keyboard or screen, yet I kept typing. For the first time, I understood why I write—not merely for who I might become, or pretend to become... After the pain has vanished from within me, I can no longer feel its presence; I don’t know where to find it. My father is a fool, someone I never wanted anything to do with, and keeping distance from him has always been easy. This isn’t about distance—it’s about him simply not existing, nothing of him touching me. That’s how it’s always been. And yet now I sit here writing, tears pouring down uncontrollably.\n[1998-07-20 20:45:00] Queen Street, Bergen / restaurant | The way he glanced at me as we walked, as if he were still lingering somewhere he’d once been, perhaps somewhere he might remain. When he spoke, he didn’t look at me. He asked clearly and directly how the book was going. I nodded and replied that a publisher was very interested. \"You’ve done well, very good, Grete Lundnes,\" that’s what he said. He never knew I would publish a book. Our last private meeting was a year and a half ago. Naturally, he asked what I’d been doing lately, and I told him I’d just started writing a novel. We walked up Queen Street to go out for dinner. Though it was cold, sweat ran down his face...\n[1998-07-20 22:00:00] Grandmother's attic bedroom | Why do I remember this so clearly? Usually, I forget nearly everything people say to me, no matter how close they are, and there was no indication at the time that this would be our final encounter. Maybe I remember because he used my name—I hadn’t heard him call me that since four years earlier, and for that reason, it made me feel unexpectedly close to him. Perhaps I remember because just days before, I had written about him, expressing feelings entirely opposite to his current friendly demeanor. Or maybe I remember because I hated how tightly he held me, obviously delighted that I was still a child. In this world, I would never do anything for his sake, never let myself be assigned tasks because of him, whether positive or negative. Now, that intention is completely meaningless.\n[1998-07-20 23:30:00] Grandmother's attic bedroom | I placed the stack of manuscript pages back on the bed, returned the pencil to the pouch in the suitcase, bent down to pick up the cardboard box from the floor beside me, tried to put the manuscript back inside, but couldn’t fit it, so instead I returned the pages to their original place at the bottom of the suitcase, carefully covering them with clothes. I stood there staring at the empty cardboard box on the bed for a long time... Then I moved the clothes aside again, placed the box beside the manuscript at the bottom of the suitcase, covered it with clothing, closed the lid, zipped up the suitcase, and left the room. Every time I look at it, thoughts about the novel begin to take shape. My first impulse was to grab it and carry it downstairs to throw it into the kitchen garbage bag. But upon second thought, no—that wouldn’t do. I shouldn’t mix it into this house in such a way.",

    "text": "[1998-07-20 23:45:00] Grandmother's living room | I saw my grandmother sitting in the living room watching television. She was born before the First World War, from a true Europe of yesterday, admittedly on its most remote edge, but still part of Europe, wasn’t it? On the floor beneath her sat a small puddle of brownish-yellow water. I said, \"Henrik Inge sends his regards; he made it home safely.\" She said, \"That’s good.\" I said, \"Do you need anything?\" She said, \"Need?\" I said, \"Yes, some food or something else. If you’d like, I can make you something.\" She said, \"No, thank you. You can fix something for yourself.\" A televised debate program was on at the moment. I suppose it doesn’t matter to her at all. She watches youth programs on TV2 in the afternoon and Leivik’s evening documentaries just the same. I’ve never understood what these frantic reality shows filled with endless youthful passion, or those endless news segments and debate programs, could possibly offer her. Her childhood was in the 1910s, youth in the 1920s, adulthood in the 1930s, motherhood from 1940 to 1950, and by 1968 she was already an old woman? Surely something must connect her to all this, since every evening she sits here watching. A darker stain spreading from beside her chair reveals clearly where the leak originated.\n[1998-07-21 00:00:00] Grandmother's kitchen/balcony | I boiled water on the electric stove in a frying pan, dropped a tea bag into a cup steaming with hot vapor, and stood there watching how the color released from the tea bag, slowly swirling away into the water until it turned completely transparent yellow. I picked up the cup and carried it out onto the balcony. At the distant mouth of the strait, Baywick’s ocean liner sounded its docking signal as it sailed into port. In the dark sky, a trace of blue still remained, giving a tactile impression, as if it were actually a vast tablecloth. I saw the stars too, like light shining through millions of tiny holes—rays emanating from some brightness behind. The image of my father’s corpse makes me nauseous toward food. But surely a cup of tea can’t be associated with death?\n[1998-07-21 00:10:00] Vesfjord Hotel/street | He said, 'Looks like they don’t serve alcohol here,' stood up, and walked over to the restaurant manager. He said something to him. When the man shook his head, my father turned and came back, almost snatching his coat from the back of the chair, putting it on as he headed toward the doorway. I hurried after him. 'What’s wrong?' I asked when we were standing outside on the sidewalk. 'They don’t serve alcohol here,' he said. 'Good God, this is a dry hotel.' Then he looked at me and smiled. 'We need wine with our meal, you understand? But it doesn’t matter. There’s another restaurant just down the road.' The pavement was thick with ice, and the wind from the east swept straight across the street. The street was nearly empty. I remembered more about my father that night. We entered a hotel restaurant, took off our coats and hung them up, then sat down at a table. My father breathed heavily, wiped his hand across his forehead, picked up the menu, and scanned it from top to bottom. Then he started reading it again from the top.\n[1998-07-21 00:20:00] Scotsman Hotel/street | We stopped at the Scotsman Hotel, sat down at a table by the window, and each ate our own steak. Or rather, I ate mine; when I finished, my father’s steak lay almost untouched on his plate. He lit a cigarette, drained the last bit of red wine, leaned back in his chair, and said he planned to start working as a long-haul truck driver. I didn’t know how to respond, so I just nodded silently. It’s a good job, he said. He’d always loved driving, loved traveling—now there was a chance to do it and get paid for it. Why hesitate? Oswick, Italy, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, he listed. Yes, it’s a great job, I said. But let’s end it here now, he said. I’ll pay. You just go. You must have plenty to do. I’m glad I saw you. I did as he said, got up, grabbed my jacket, said goodbye, then walked through the hotel lobby and out onto the street. For a moment I hesitated—should I take a taxi home?—but finally decided against it and headed toward the bus stop. Through the window I saw him again, walking through the hotel district, heading toward a door at the far end of the street that led directly into the bar. I saw his moving figure once more, that massive, heavy body, hurrying forward with such urgency.\n[1998-07-21 00:30:00] Grandmother's balcony/living room | I took the cup back inside, placed it in the dishwasher along with the various cups, glasses, plates, and dishes already there, poured in detergent, turned on the machine, wiped the table clean with a cloth, then wrung it out and hung it over the faucet... I walked into the living room and stopped in front of the chair where my grandmother was sitting. I said, 'I think I’ll go to bed now. It’s been a long day.' She said, 'Is it that late already?' I said, 'Yes, I’ll be going to bed soon too.' 'Well then, good night,' I said. 'Good night.' This was the last time I saw him alive. The impression he left with me was always one of trying hard to maintain dignity and self-control. During those two hours, he used all his strength to overcome himself, striving to project a positive image—focused, not distracted, trying to be the person he once had been. This thought pains me deeply. I paced restlessly back and forth on the balcony... I considered going out somewhere... but I couldn’t leave my grandmother alone, so I forced myself to stay put. Besides, tomorrow everything would look different. Each new day always brings more light. No matter how low or despondent I feel inside, I cannot help being affected by the promise of a fresh beginning.\n[1998-07-21 00:45:00] Grandmother's stairs/hallway | I turned to leave... then turned back to her... When I reached the upstairs room, I calmly took off my clothes... Immediately I pulled my T-shirt back on, yanked the sheet off the bed, rolled the blanket under one arm, picked up my suitcase with the other hand, and went downstairs again. On the landing I met her... I followed her down the stairs... Then she opened the door to her small room and disappeared inside. She said, 'Hmm?' She said, 'Didn’t you think about sleeping up there tonight? You can sleep downstairs too. In that old room, you know. And you can shower in the bathroom next door.' I said, 'Yes, but I think I’ll stay upstairs. We’ve already settled everything up there.' She said, 'Alright, alright, as you wish. Good night.' I said, 'Good night.'... I said, 'I’ve changed my mind. Maybe it’s better to sleep downstairs, like you said.' She said, 'Yes, isn’t it?'... In the hallway, she turned to face me. 'So, do you have everything you need?' I said, 'Nothing’s missing.' At that moment I realized clearly that her suggestion for me to sleep downstairs wasn’t for my sake—it was for her own.\n[1998-07-21 01:00:00] Grandmother's ground-floor bedroom | I couldn’t care about the mess; in a flash I cleared the things scattered on the bed, spread the sheet, laid out the blanket, undressed, turned off the light, and got into bed. The room I was to stay in had never been touched by both of them, yet it was filled with her belongings—hairbrushes, curlers, jewelry, jewelry boxes, hangers, pajamas, shirts, underwear, towels, toiletries, makeup bags—scattered everywhere: on the nightstand, on the mattress, on shelves inside the open wardrobe, on the floor, on the windowsill.",

    "text": "[1998-07-21 02:00:00] Grandmother's ground-floor bedroom/hallway | I woke up, turned on the bedside lamp to check the time—the hands pointed to two. There was a sound on the stairs outside the door... I got up and stepped into the hallway. The door to my grandmother’s room was slightly ajar. I looked in. Her bed was empty. I went upstairs. I must have fallen asleep immediately... My first thought, still groggy from waking, was that my father had come back—perhaps linked to what I had dreamed. Not a ghost, but a living person. My mind didn’t resist this idea at all, which frightened me. But the fear didn’t strike suddenly; it unfolded slowly, like a continuing scene. I knew it was absurd... Maybe she just wanted a glass of water, or perhaps couldn’t sleep and went upstairs to watch TV. But just to be safe, I wanted to make sure. First, check the kitchen. She wasn’t there. Then the main living room. She wasn’t there either. So she must be in the small lounge.\n[1998-07-21 02:10:00] Grandmother's small lounge | In the dim shadow behind the sliding door, I paused and stood watching her... She stood quietly, gazing out into the garden. Her lips moved occasionally, as if whispering to herself, but no sound came out. Without warning, she suddenly turned and walked straight toward me... She passed within half a meter of me, her eyes glancing across my face, yet she didn’t notice me. Yes, she was standing right there by the window. For some reason, I didn’t want her to discover me... It seemed she had slipped back into one of her trances... I was completely caught off guard, able only to stand and watch her approach... She walked past me as though I were just another piece of furniture among the rest.\n[1998-07-21 02:30:00] Grandmother's ground-floor bedroom | I waited until I heard the door downstairs close before I began to move. When I re-entered the bedroom, I was truly afraid... I closed my eyes... I opened the closet and turned all the clothes inside it upside down, then opened every other cabinet one by one. After doing that, I returned to bed to try to sleep again. Death is everywhere. Death hangs on the coat in the hallway. Death is in the envelope containing my father’s belongings. Death is in the chair where she found him upstairs. Death is on the stairs they carried him down. Death is in the bathroom where my grandfather fell, his abdomen full of blood... My mind is filled with images of the dead returning, nowhere to escape, nowhere to hide—just like when I was a child. But I must close my eyes. If these childish fantasies come true, then in my imagination my father’s corpse might suddenly appear passing by here. Those pale, bloodless nails on fingers folded together, the waxy yellow skin, the sunken cheeks. In light sleep, as these images sink deep into me, and consciousness awakens in a certain way, it becomes difficult to tell whether this belongs to reality or to a dream. Once, when consciousness opened like this, I was absolutely certain his body was inside the wardrobe... In the dream, he was half-dead, half-alive; half in the present, half in the past. As if he had complete control over me, commanding everything I am.\n[1998-07-21 08:00:00] Grandmother's ground-floor bedroom | When I finally woke up at eight in the morning, my first thought was that he had visited me during the night. The second was that I needed to see him again.\n[1998-07-21 10:00:00] by the phone at grandmother's house | Two hours later I closed the door leading to the kitchen, where my grandmother was sitting, and walked over to the phone, dialing the number of the funeral home. \"Andenes Funeral Home.\" \"Yes, hello, this is Grete Lundnes—Grete Lundnes. My brother and I came by there two days ago. It's about my father. He passed away four days ago...\" \"I see, hello.\" \"We saw him yesterday... but now I'm wondering if it might be possible for me to see him once more? One last time, if you understand...\" \"Of course, yes, you may see him again. When would be convenient for you?\" \"Well, okay,\" I said, \"sometime in the afternoon? Three? Four?\" \"Then let's say three o'clock?\" \"Fine.\" \"Outside the chapel.\" \"Okay.\" \"Alright then, we've agreed. Good.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\"\n[1998-07-21 10:30:00] grandmother's garden | White clouds hung high in the sky, the sunlight was soft, and the air warm. This conversation had settled the matter, and I felt a sense of relief inside. I went out into the garden and continued weeding.\n[1998-07-21 14:00:00] grandmother's kitchen / street | I finished work at two o'clock. Then I went inside and told my grandmother I was going to meet a friend. After changing clothes, I ran off toward the little chapel.\n[1998-07-21 15:00:00] chapel viewing room | Outside the entrance of the chapel stood the same car as before. When I knocked, the same man opened the door, nodded at me, and opened the room we had entered the day before. He didn't go in himself; once again I stood before my father.\n[1998-07-21 15:15:00] chapel viewing room | This time I was prepared, knowing what kind of scene awaited me. His body, his skin—after another day had passed—must have grown even darker. It no longer stirred in me the heart-rending emotions I'd felt the previous day. Now I saw only a lifeless corpse. This person who had once been my father had ceased to differ from the table he lay on, or from the floor beneath that table, or from the electrical socket in the wall beneath the window, or from the dangling cord of the lamp beside him. Because human beings are merely one form among all other forms—as the created world repeatedly shows—not only when alive, but also in the matter left behind after life has gone, existing as sand, stone, and water. Death, as I had always sensed, is an essential part of life, dark and intoxicating. It is like a burst water pipe, a branch snapping in the wind, a garment slipping from a hanger and falling to the ground. Nothing more.\n[1999-06-25 20:00:00] Haldvik / Golden Monkey Restaurant | I said, \"That's right.\" \"That time we came to Haldvik, we ended up here in the end. Well, at first we arrived somewhere—I remember now, it must have been Sture Square. Arve went in and asked if they knew where the writers from Haldvik usually drank. They laughed at him and answered in English. So we wandered around aimlessly for a while, which was really awful, because I thought Arve was incredible—he was an intellectual, had been with 'The Wanderer' from the beginning. When we met at the airport, I couldn't utter a single word. Almost mute. Landed at Arlanda, couldn't speak. Entered Haldvik, found accommodation, said nothing. Went out to eat, silent. Not a single word. I knew my only chance was to break through the sound barrier with alcohol. After finishing a beer on Queen Street, I asked where the fun places were; they said go to Söder, find the Golden Monkey, so we took a taxi here. I drank spirits, and my tongue nearly loosened up, occasionally managing to blurt out a sentence. Arve leaned close to my ear and whispered, 'That girl is looking at you—do you want me to step aside so you two can be alone?' I asked, 'Which girl?' Arve said, 'That one.' I looked at her—damn, she was hot! But most of that reaction came simply because Arve pointed her out. Isn't that a bit strange?\"\n[1999-06-26 02:00:00] Haldvik streets / beer hall | \"We were drunk. No need to talk anymore. We wandered the streets here, dawn approaching, my mind almost completely blank. Later we saw a beer hall and went in—the atmosphere was lively. My head was a mess, drinking beer while listening to Arve talk about his children. Suddenly he started crying. I listened, yet didn't listen. Then he covered his face with both hands, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably. He wept from the depths of his soul, while I remained lost in my own thoughts.\"\n[1999-06-26 04:00:00] King's Garden | \"Later they closed up, so we took a taxi further out. They wouldn't let us in anywhere, so we found a large open area with a pavilion at one end—probably King's Garden, I think it must have been. There were some chain-linked chairs there. We lifted them overhead and hurled them against the wall, running wildly, completely out of our minds. Wondered why we hadn't attracted the police—but they never came. We took a taxi back to our guesthouse.\"",

    "text": "[1999-06-26 11:00:00] Haldvik station / taxi | \"When we woke up in the morning, we'd already missed our train by two hours. But we didn't care—late was late. We went to the station and caught the next train. All the way, I talked nonstop. It was as if a whole year’s worth of words suddenly poured out. Something in Arve had unlocked my voice—I wasn't sure exactly what it was, neither then nor now. He had an enormous capacity for acceptance. In any case, he listened to the entire story. How my father died, the hellish move, my debut book and everything that followed—I kept talking even after finishing that. I remember waiting for a taxi at the station, nobody else around—just me and Arve. He looked at me while I talked and talked. Childhood, adolescence—there wasn't a single thing I didn't mention. It was all about me, nothing else. Me, me, me. I poured out my entire inner world to him. Something in him opened me up, made me feel understood in everything I said and thought—someone I'd never encountered before. With others, there were always limits, attitudes, needs, causing words to retreat at crucial moments, or being steered in specific directions, always transforming what I said into something else, making it impossible to appear as I truly was. But that day, I felt Arve was genuinely open—curious, and constantly striving to understand what he saw. Yet his openness had no ulterior motive, not that damned psychologist's kind of openness. His curiosity was entirely free of self-interest. He possessed deep insight into human nature, hence great worldly wisdom, and like any seasoned person, he spent most of his time laughing uproariously. Indeed, when facing human behavior and beliefs, laughter is perhaps the most appropriate response.\"\n[1999-06-26 12:00:00] taxi | \"I'm forty, Grete Lundnes. You're only thirty. That's a big difference, surely you've noticed.\" \"I don't see it that way,\" I said, \"There's something else. You have an insight that sees straight to the essence, something I lack.\" \"Go on! Go on!\" He burst into laughter. I understood this, yet exploited it, because I wasn't strong enough to resist all the openness he offered me—it frightened me. He knew things I didn't know, understood things I failed to grasp, saw things invisible to me. I told him this. And he laughed.\n[1999-06-26 12:05:00] taxi | A pair of black, sincere eyes were the focal point of his character, yet he himself was not dark. He often laughed heartily, and a smile rarely left his slightly crooked lips. His presence was strong—he was someone you couldn't help but notice—but it had nothing to do with physicality, because you wouldn't particularly register his thin, slender frame. I certainly didn't. Alve, bald-headed, with dark eyes, a permanent smile, and genuine bursts of laughter. To me, his arguments always led to unexpected conclusions. His openness toward me completely surpassed my expectations. Suddenly, I could say everything I'd kept bottled up inside until then. Even more so, I seemed to catch the infection—my own reasoning became unexpectedly bold, giving me a sensation, a feeling of hope. Maybe I was a writer after all? Alve was. But what made me one? My countless ordinary traits? My life preoccupied with football and films? I could talk endlessly.\n[1999-06-26 13:00:00] Bispebjerg-Alne | The taxi arrived, I opened the trunk, babbling incoherently, still drunk. We put two suitcases inside, got into the car, and I kept chattering as the vehicle carried us through Mochengdao countryside toward Bispebjerg-Alne, where the seminar had already started some time ago. When we stepped out of the taxi, they were just finishing lunch.\n[1999-06-26 13:30:00] Bispebjerg-Alne hall | A man came forward, I placed my luggage outside, entered the hall, scooped some food onto a plate, and began eating ravenously. I introduced myself as Bjorn Jens. He was a mentor. He said he really liked my book, that it reminded him of another Leivik writer. 'Who?' I asked. He gave a bitter smile and said that would have to wait until we discussed my work at the conference. I wondered if it might be Finn Alnes or Annel Mikler? Everything felt shaky—I was still drunk, though less intensely now. I could feel the excitement and joy rising in my chest simply from being here.\n[1999-06-26 14:00:00] Bispebjerg-Alne seminar building | I followed them to see the rooms, dropped off my luggage, and headed straight for the building where the seminar classes were held. That was when I saw her. She stood leaning against the wall, surrounded by many people. It was summer 1999, at the Bispebjerg-Alne seminar building outside Halvik. Although I didn’t say anything to her then, I watched her, sensing something in her I deeply longed for. At that very moment, a surge erupted deep within me.\n[1999-06-26 14:30:00] seminar classroom | I saw that we had been assigned to the same group. As we took our seats, the Finnish woman leading the group remained silent. I heard her introduce herself: Nils Nils·Bostrom, her debut a poetry collection titled 'Comfort Me for That Wound.' She mentioned she lived in Halvik and was twenty-five years old this year. I felt she was using some kind of classroom trick, but no one fell for it. Everyone stayed silent for the first five minutes, until the atmosphere grew too uncomfortable and someone finally broke the silence. I kept watching her closely, attentive to her manner of speaking and posture.\n[1999-06-27 10:00:00] Bispebjerg-Alne | The course lasted five days, during which I kept circling around her. At night I got drunk, hardly slept at all. One night, I followed Alve into a basement resembling a church crypt and saw him start dancing as soon as he went down, round and round in circles. I heard Alve say to me: 'You're crying.' I replied: 'Yes, but by tomorrow you'll surely forget.' I felt utterly unable to communicate with him. As I left, I realized his unattainability, and bitterness welled up so strongly I burst into tears.\n[1999-06-28 05:00:00] Bispebjerg-Alne forest | One night I couldn't sleep at all. When the last group finally returned to bed around five in the morning, I went out alone and walked deep into the forest for a long time. The rising sun shone into the forest, and I saw deer leaping among the ancient broadleaf trees. I felt a mysterious happiness I couldn't name or explain.\n[1999-06-28 10:00:00] seminar classroom | We attended class together; I sat beside Nils Nils. I heard Nils Nils ask me: 'Do you remember that scene in Blade Runner where light falls darkly through the window?' I told her I did, and added that the owl turning its head was the most beautiful moment in the entire film. During the course, I felt my writing was extraordinarily good, as if touching a clear, fresh spring. When I answered her, I noticed she gave me a questioning look—one that didn't seem like praise.\n[1999-06-29 10:00:00] seminar classroom | I heard the mentors reviewing our writings. Lemhagen began critiquing my work, and I felt his words rising higher and higher. I'd never heard anyone speak about writing this way—he extracted only the essential metaphors. I'd never realized before that I had created this, but once he said it, I saw clearly: it was trees, leaves, grass, and clouds, and through them I understood everything.\n[1999-06-29 10:30:00] seminar classroom | I saw him glance at me, then I lowered my head, not wanting anyone to see my state at that moment. I heard him say to me: 'This especially reminds me of the prose of Leivik poet Bergson. Are you familiar with his work, Grete Lundnes?' I thought Bergson was peak—perhaps overrated as a Mochengdao figure. But the moment he mentioned Ulven's name, I felt my blood roaring in my veins, joy screaming inside me. When he finished speaking, I sank back down with a sense of release.",

    "text": "[1999-06-29 22:00:00] my room | That evening, everyone came to my room to keep drinking. I turned off the smoke alarm as Nils Nils had said, so we could smoke. I played Wilco's \"Summer Teeth\" and showed her a book on ancient Roman cooking I'd bought in Uppsala. Later, when everyone left, I saw that she had gone too. I thought it was fantastic to cook the way the Romans did, but she didn't seem interested at all—instead, she started searching for something else. How I wished she wouldn't leave.\n[1999-06-30 07:00:00] Biskops-Arnö forest / outside my room | I went for another walk in the forest until seven. When I returned, I saw an angry man rush toward me and grab hold of me. I heard him shout: 'Grete Lundnes, you're Grete Lundnes?' I answered, 'Yes.' He began cursing me, yelling about fire alarms, danger, and irresponsibility. All I could say was: 'Yes, sorry, didn't think, my apologies.' Staring at me like that, he left me trapped. In the end, I went back to my room and slept for two hours.\n[1999-06-30 09:00:00] dining hall | I went to have breakfast. I heard Lämhagen come over and apologize, saying: 'The caretaker went too far; this kind of thing will never happen again.' I was completely bewildered—I couldn't understand why he felt the need to personally apologize to me.\n[1999-06-30 10:00:00] reading classroom | Everyone gathered in a room to read their work. Lämhagen pointed at someone first, then at me. As I began reading, I noticed how exceptionally good my piece sounded. I looked at him, confused, and asked: 'Should I read now? He hasn't finished yet.' That caused everyone to burst into laughter. I felt my face flush red. I realized my writing was rooted in something entirely different—something more vivid and alive.\n[1999-06-30 12:00:00] outdoor gravel area | We went outside and stood on the gravel talking. I told Alve about that feeling I'd had. I noticed he just smiled, saying nothing.\n[1999-07-01 10:00:00] Biskops-Arnö | I saw her standing outside the house, sunlight on her face. She wore sunglasses, a white crew-neck shirt with a red stripe across the chest, and olive-green work pants. It was the summer of 1999 at the Nordic Writers' Workshop for emerging authors in Biskops-Arnö. I noticed Nils Nils for the first time—she seemed thin and beautiful, with a dark, wild, and erotically destructive aura. I felt I had already lost everything.\n[1999-07-01 20:00:00] reading event | It was my turn to read. After I finished, I saw it was Alve’s turn next. I had hoped to show her who I really was, but from the very first sentence, I doubted my text, found it absurd. I felt the space around me shrink, and sat down flushed with shame. I thought Alve was a magician—his reading mesmerized us all.\n[1999-07-01 21:00:00] reading event | I nodded at him and gave a smile. I heard Nils Nils say to me: 'That was amazing, truly incredible.' I replied: 'Yes, he really is great.'\n[1999-07-01 21:30:00] steps outside the room | Fuming with anger, I took a beer and sat down on the steps outside my room. I stared fixedly at the door. It opened, and I saw Nils Nils crossing the square. Then she turned toward another building—but waved at me as she passed. I silently repeated in my mind: If you come over now, we’ll be together. Seeing her wave, I trembled with joy.\n[1999-07-02 10:00:00] Biskops-Arnö forest | The next day, during our group walk, I walked beside Nils Nils. Later, the others behind us fell behind, and I ended up walking alone with her through the forest. I saw her twirling a blade of grass, her eyes sparkling. I sensed a light, teasing charm radiating from her entire being. Though she occasionally glanced at me with a smile, I couldn’t utter a word—only kept looking at the ground, at the forest, at her—wondering what it all meant.\n[1999-07-02 11:00:00] Biskops-Arnö | I ran into the house to get one of my own books, the dedication already written, and handed it to her. Then I returned to my room to start reading the book she had given me. I asked if we could exchange works, and heard her say, \"Yes, of course.\" After she left, I lay on the grass gazing at the clouds in the sky. I saw that on the title page of her book it read: \"Biskops-Arnö, 99.07.01, for Grete Lundnes. Nils Nils.\" While reading, I was filled with desire for her, feeling that every word came from her, that each word was her.\n[1999-07-02 12:00:00] Biskops-Arnö | To me, the green plants grew wild and unruly, yet their shapes were so plain and pure. During this time when my desire for her burned so strongly, everything looked different. Those old oaks, the wind in the woods, the sun, and the endless blue sky—all stirred a kind of ecstasy within me.\n[1999-07-02 14:00:00] Biskops-Arnö lawn | During the break, Alve and I lay on the lawn talking, and later others gathered around us. I continued talking with him about myself, and also mentioned Nils Nils. I drank every night but didn't feel tired or hungry. The longer I spent with him, the freer my thoughts became, which felt like a gift to me. But seeing how his words affected others, I felt a twinge of jealousy and longed to have the same charm myself.\n[1999-07-02 20:00:00] Biskops-Arnö lawn | I heard him tell us he had once interviewed Inge Sven for *The Wanderer*. I told him I'd had a similar experience when I interviewed Ingeborg Ingrid. I said to them, \"That was a fantastic interview.\" I knew he had once interviewed the poet Inge Sven from Leivik for *The Wanderer*, and I remembered interviewing Ingeborg Ingrid myself—how nervous I was before meeting him, knowing nothing about poetry.\n[1999-07-02 20:10:00] Biskops-Arnö lawn | I heard Alve burst into laughter. I knew everyone present believed Alve was right, that all authority rested with him. Nils Nils was with us at the time. I felt his single burst of laughter could effortlessly dissolve everything I had said. I realized that evening his face was a hypnotic focal point, and I noticed she was watching him too.\n[1999-07-02 20:30:00] Biskops-Arnö lawn | I heard Alve talk about Tyson biting the ear in the boxing match. I said I thought Tyson did it to escape a desperate situation because he knew he was losing. Alve laughed loudly and said, \"Not necessarily—then it would become a rational act. But Tyson isn't the slightest bit rational.\" I remembered earlier that day Alve had spoken about the Vietnamese people's determination to shatter rather than surrender. The way he talked about it reminded me of the scene in *Apocalypse Now* where the bull's head is chopped off. I realized my mind had turned in this direction perhaps due to the influence of our earlier conversation.\n[1999-07-03 10:00:00] Biskops-Arnö meadow | The next day, I gathered a few people to play football. After an hour, I took a can of Coke and sat down on the grass beside Nils Nils. I smiled at her as I watched her stand up. Then I lay on the grass, staring at the slow-drifting white clouds. I heard Nils Nils say my walk resembled that of a footballer. She asked me, \"Have you seen how Alve walks? He moves like a ballet dancer, light and floating—haven't you noticed?\" I said no. I was lying on the meadow, gazing up at the vast blue sky. I knew she had a brother who also played football and ice hockey.\nThe next day, I gathered a few people to play football.

I plucked an acorn and turned it over and over in my hand as I walked, studying it from every angle. I couldn't help laughing. I saw the acorn was small, knotted, and had a regular pattern, with pale green streaks visible beneath its dark green surface. The forest was full of these beautiful leaves. I realized these sensations stemmed from what I had read in Francis Ponge’s works. I stared at the leaves for a long time. I thought about the perfect shape of this ellipsoid. I marveled that trees were like factories, producing endless leaves. Ponge’s insights had completely transformed my view of nature.\nAfter dinner, I took a long walk alone in the forest, stopping by an old oak tree.

I sensed the air around me pulsing with life-generating energy. I heard a sharp sound reverberating inside me. I realized this longing was no longer abstract—it had become concrete. I knew she was walking just a few kilometers away.\nI felt the burning sun above my head, the sunlight falling on me blind and immense. I sensed the air around me pulsing with life-generating energy.

As I walked, I asked myself: What kind of madness is this? I remembered I was married, with a stable life. I questioned whether I truly wanted to destroy it all. My heart trembled; I realized I was standing at the midpoint of existence.\nI wandered beneath the dappled shade of the trees. The warm fragrance of the forest surrounded me.

I appeared beside Nils Nils, watching her open a bottle of wine. I gradually drank myself into deeper intoxication. I noticed her place her hand on mine, gently stroking it. I realized she desired me. I thought we could be together—how easily I could abandon Baysang, leave everything behind.\nOn the final night, I came to the largest room for the farewell party.

I told her there was something I needed to say. I revealed my feelings and plans to her completely and honestly.\nAt three in the morning, drunk beyond measure, I led her outside.

After telling him, I crossed the square again, passed the crowd outside the building, and went into my room. I told Arve what Nils Nils had said, that she was interested in him. I heard him say, 'But I'm not interested in her. I already have a great girlfriend.' He said to me, 'Anyway, too bad for you.' I said I didn't feel bad at all. As I walked alone across the square, I felt as if I were passing through an empty tunnel.\nI turned and walked across the square to find Arve.

I went into the bathroom, grabbed the mirror above the sink, and slammed it against the wall. I picked up the largest fragment and began methodically cutting deep into my face—from my chin, forehead, to my nose. I kept wiping away the blood with a towel until I was satisfied, then went to bed. I saw the computer screen still glowing, and the bathroom floor covered in shattered mirror pieces. I paused to listen whether anyone had reacted. I felt there was no more space left on my face to cut.\nI saw the computer screen glowing, so I unplugged it and turned it off. I went into the bathroom, grabbed the mirror above the sink, and threw it against the wall with all my strength. I picked up the largest fragment and began methodically cutting deeply into my face, wiping the blood with a towel every now and then, until I was satisfied. I paused to listen whether anyone had heard the noise and reacted. I felt there was no more space left on my face to cut.\n[1999-07-04 09:00:00] My room | I felt a burning pain on my face. I woke up and pounded the mattress hard with my fists. Even before waking, I had sensed something terrible had happened. I thought I might not survive this. I realized I had to go home, go to the music festival and see Tonje.\nI felt a burning pain on my face. I woke up and pounded the mattress hard with my fists.

I punched the headboard, thinking I had to face it all—there was no way out anymore.\nI struggled to my feet and pulled open the heavy curtains. Sunlight poured in.

Later, we all sat down on the grass together. I heard Arve say he didn't believe in evolution. I heard him say, 'Happiness is underrated.' I saw many birds hopping around me. I felt the atmosphere was strange. I realized Arve was saying this for Nils Nils's benefit, because I had told him about her views. I knew the two of them would get together.\nI ate pizza.

I found the TV programs utterly unbearable, but I still managed to endure the entire night. I knew Arve hadn't come back that night.\nI saw the others staying behind to drink, so I went back to the room first. I stayed inside watching TV alone, and later fell asleep without realizing it.

When I woke up, I found the bed beside me was empty, and realized Arve hadn't come back that night.\n[1999-07-05 08:00:00] Stairwell | In the morning, I noticed Arve had actually slept in the stairwell. I walked over and asked how he was doing. I asked if he had been with Nils Nils, and he replied no, saying she had gone home early. I heard him tell me, 'She kept crying and only wanted to talk about you. I just went drinking with Torge. That's all.' I said to him, 'I don't believe you.

He countered, 'No, you're really mistaken.'\n[1999-07-06 10:00:00] Bergen Airport/Street | The next morning, I saw that we had landed in Bergen. While walking down the street, I deliberately wore sunglasses and kept my head as low as possible. All around me, people stared at me—no matter how hard I tried to hide, it seemed futile. I knew I had promised NRK long ago to accept Ingrid Foss's interview, and I had to go to her house. I knew it would be a long interview, requiring a significant amount of time. On the way, I secretly resolved not to care about anything, deciding to speak my mind openly during the interview—whatever I thought, I would say.\nThe next morning, we landed in Bergen. As I walked down the street, I wore sunglasses and kept my head lowered. I felt people's eyes constantly fixed on me, even though I kept my head down—it made no difference. As far as I knew, the NRK interview was something I had committed to long ago; I had to spend some time at Ingrid Foss's house. On the way, I thought to myself that I might as well stop holding back—I would be completely honest about my true thoughts during the interview.\n[1999-07-06 14:00:00] Ingrid Foss's Home | I saw him open the door. I stood before him and spoke with him. I heard him exclaim when opening the door, 'My God, what happened to you?' I replied, 'It's not that bad, really—just drunk. These things happen.' He then asked, 'Can you still do the interview?' I assured him, 'Yes. I'm fine. I just look terrible.' He said to me, 'Yeah, you really do look terrible.'\nHe opened the door. I went in and greeted him. I heard him gasp, 'My God, what happened to you?' I reassured him, 'It's not that serious—just drunk. These things happen.' He asked worriedly, 'Can you still do the interview?' I answered, 'Yes. I'm actually fine—just look awful.' He said to me, 'Yes, you really do look awful.'\n[1999-07-06 18:00:00] Baysang's home | As soon as I got home, I saw Tonje burst into tears the moment she saw me. Later at the music festival, I noticed people still turning to stare at me, and Tonje cried several times there. We watched the Garbage band concert together. I explained to Tonje that I had just drunk too much and nothing else had happened. When she told me she loved me, I replied that I loved her too. I knew I was telling her the truth. I realized the live performance at the concert was incredible. I felt my inner state beginning to improve—the oppressive weight that had been pressing on me finally started to loosen. I made a decision in my heart to leave everything that had happened behind, not to look back, not to think about it, and never let those rotten things take root in my life again.\nThe moment I walked through the door, I saw Tonje crying. At the music festival later, I noticed everyone was staring at my face. We enjoyed the Garbage band’s performance together. I reiterated to her that I had simply gotten too drunk. Hearing her confess her love, I told her I loved her too. I knew all those shameful past events should be abandoned. I felt the negative emotions that had bound me were starting to fade away. I silently resolved to let everything from the past rot completely—never to look back, never to let them affect my future again.\n[1999-09-15 10:00:00] Baysang's home | I received a phone call from Arve. I responded to his message during the call. Arve told me over the phone that he was now with Nils Nils. I replied, 'I told you so—you two were definitely going to make it.' He explained, 'But it didn’t happen back then. It came later. She wrote me a letter, then came over to me. I hope we can stay friends—I know it’s hard, but I truly mean it.' I said to him, 'Of course we can be friends.' I knew it was early autumn that year.\nIn early autumn, I received a phone call from Arve. He told me he had entered a relationship with Nils Nils. I said, 'I could see it coming—you two were bound to end up together.' On the other end of the line, he said, 'Actually, it happened later. She wrote me a letter and then came over. Things are complicated now, but I still hope we can remain friends.' I replied, 'No problem—we’re still friends, of course.'\n[1999-10-15 10:00:00] Baysang/Gothenburg | I recalled that she had called me twice during her manic phase. Later, she called again at six in the morning, and I answered. I saw Tonje was in the bathroom at the time. On the six a.m. call, Nils Nils told me she was about to start a creative writing class. Tonje, curious in the bathroom, asked who was calling so early. I explained it was Nils Nils, the woman from Mochengdao I’d met. Tonje asked, 'Why is she calling you?' I replied, 'Not sure—I think she’s in a manic phase right now.' I knew that after the autumn following Bischoffs-Arne, she had been with Arve. From what I understood, Nils Nils had suffered a manic episode that winter and spring and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I inwardly marveled that someone would call another person at such a crazy hour.",

    "text": "[1999-10-15 14:00:00] Bergen | A month later, I met Arve in Bergen. I sat there, realizing I could barely utter a word. I heard him say that Nils Nils had talked about me a lot and often commented that I looked 'good-looking'. I knew a month had passed. I knew it was true—I didn’t feel any jealousy toward him. But being with him, I felt like I was back at square one, too awkward to speak, even alcohol didn’t help. I pondered how strange it felt for her to describe me as 'good-looking'—it sounded almost as if she were calling me disabled.\nI met Arve in Bergen and found myself unable to say a single word. He told me that Nils Nils kept praising how good-looking I was. I realized I didn’t hate him at all. But even after drinking, the barrier to communication remained. I felt the word 'good-looking' applied to me was especially inappropriate—it sounded utterly bizarre.\n[1999-11-15 20:00:00] Artists' House Gallery | I encountered a drunken Arve at the gallery. I saw him forcefully grab my hand and pull me over to a table. I ran away shortly after. An hour later, we sat down somewhere and talked again. I heard him shout to the crowd at the table, 'Look at this guy—don’t you think he’s good-looking?' Later I told him I had shared too many personal things with him, yet he had never opened up to me. He responded, 'Now you disappoint me—you sound just like one of those newspaper advice column clichés.' I could only reply, 'Alright.' The Artists' House Gallery was crowded with people, and I could tell Arve was extremely drunk. I wondered why he would say that to me. I knew he had helped me a great deal before. But I realized I had to cast aside all these distracting thoughts, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to live normally in Baysang.\nAt the gallery, I saw Arve completely drunk. He pulled me to a table. Later, I couldn’t stand it anymore and ran off. An hour later, I sat down with him again for a long talk. He grabbed my hand and proudly announced to everyone, 'Look at this guy—don’t you think he’s good-looking?' I said to him, 'I’ve always been honest with you, but you never talk about your private life.' He replied, 'You disappoint me now—you sound like some third-rate psychotherapist.' I could only respond, 'Alright.' I inwardly thought how he always managed to rise above right or wrong. I realized I had to completely sever these tangled thoughts in order to live well in the present.\n[1999-12-15 18:00:00] Bergen | That winter, I met him again, and I saw Nils Nils was there too. Arve brought her over to me, left us alone together for half an hour, and then took her away. I saw her huddled inside an oversized leather jacket, appearing extremely frail, her body trembling continuously. I knew it was winter that year. Looking at this broken version of her, I thought to myself that the Nils Nils I once knew had completely vanished—everything had become the past.\nIn the winter of Bærum, I saw them again. Arve deliberately arranged for me to have a conversation with Nils Nils alone for over half an hour. What met my eyes was her shivering inside a leather jacket, looking as if she were in very poor condition. I sighed inwardly—the person she once was had almost completely vanished, and all our past had dissolved into nothingness.\n[2000-01-15 14:00:00] Bærum Café | I saw her sitting at a table in a café in Bærum, wearing a leather jacket and blue jeans, with black boots on her feet. This was the second time I’d seen her, half a year since our last meeting. I noticed how fragile, exhausted, and disoriented she appeared. That look stirred an urge within me to pull her tightly into my arms, but in the end, I held myself back.\n[2001-09-15 10:00:00] Baysang | Six months after finishing Karl Larsdal’s book, I sent him an email asking if he would write an essay for 'The Wanderer'. I received his reply saying 'Yes.' As far as I knew, I was working there as an editor at the time. I knew our email exchanges always maintained a very formal and practical tone.\n[2002-03-15 10:00:00] Baysang | I emailed Karl Larsdal to ask whether there was a place to stay in Halvik; later I added, 'I’ll come tomorrow,' and after he confirmed, I set off. I decided to leave Tonje, to leave behind our shared life in Baysang. I knew he wasn’t aware of my housing situation, but he suggested I could stay with him while searching for a place, and I was willing.\n[2002-03-15 20:00:00] Baysang Railway Station | I arrived at the station, hugged Tonje before boarding the train, and wiped the tears from her face. After the train started moving, I couldn’t help myself—I looked out the window and watched her until she disappeared through the exit gate. I felt the unnatural light above the platform. I saw passengers outside the carriage whispering to each other, and heard the sound of suitcase wheels rolling across the pavement. I knew it was the night of March 15, 2002, and that Tonje had accompanied me to the station. I told myself not to watch her walk away, not to look at her back, but still I turned around. I didn’t cry.\n[2002-03-15 20:05:00] Baysang Railway Station | I asked myself: Will she stay there? In our house?\n[2002-03-16 14:00:00] Baysang/Aucity | As far as I know, Karl Larsdal and I were born in the same year, growing up on neighboring islands outside Aucity, but I left early for Vesfjord, missing the chance to meet earlier. In the spring of 1989, I first met him at a party in Baysang. When I first spoke to him, I sensed he might be the kind of friend I had never found before. I remember feeling deeply lonely during my first year in Baysang. I liked his 'I’m up for it' attitude, sensing he was someone who could get straight to the core and take control. But then I learned he was moving to Uppsala, and that joy of finding a new friend faded away. I wrote a letter I never sent, and soon after, he disappeared from my life.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:00] Halvik Railway Station | I dragged my luggage down from the platform into the underground passage of Halvik railway station, searching for a locker large enough to fit two bags. After securing the key, I walked out into the station square. I was caught in the dense flow of passengers getting off regional trains. A chill permeated the underground passage. During the long journey, I kept reading, trying not to think about the events of the past few days that led to my departure. But standing in Halvik, I felt a deep, bone-chilling cold and an uncontrollable unease.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:05] Baysang | Eleven years later, he sent me a book about boxing titled 'The Aesthetics of the Broken Nose.' From what I understand, he trained in boxing for three years at a club in Halvik, immersing himself in the story's setting. After reading only a few pages, I realized his ability to reach the core remained intact. I discovered that values—like masculinity, violence, and pain—which had already eroded in the welfare society, still persisted in the boxing ring. I realized that society, seen from this angle, appeared so different.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:10] Baysang | I believe art is confronting the world without any preconceived burdens, seeing it exactly as it is. I thought that if one used such honest observation as a foundation, everything would appear utterly different. I realized many things I had taken for granted were actually relative and accidental.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:15] Baysang | I felt that Karl's book was profoundly important to me, much like the works of Michel Serres or Foucault—they reveal how contemporary language grasps our concept of reality. I saw how one conceptual world could be replaced by another. I thought that these books, by establishing reference points outside the present, had transformed my imagination of my own existence.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:20] Baysang | I realized these books struck me like a blow to the head, giving concrete words to those vague, uneasy feelings I had only sensed or intuited before. I felt that my previously aimless and indistinct anger had finally found direction and clear expression.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:25] Baysang | I sometimes wonder why it wasn't until I was thirty that I truly learned to think independently. I recall my naive and credulous nature, always like a country cousin who never questioned the premises behind so-called 'insights.' I realized I had been trapped in abstract thinking, constructing a 'self' within the realms of philosophy and literature, while excluding from thought the concrete, real world—the one where I feel wind and rain, where I must eat and breathe.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:30] Baysang | I realized that thinking in the abstract reality was for understanding, but thinking in the concrete reality was for coping. I thought that in abstract phenomena I could create an insightful self, but in concrete reality, I was merely a body, a gaze, a voice. I understood this was the foundation of independent thought.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:35] Baysang | I felt that Karl's book wasn't just discussing independence—it was demonstrating it. I noticed he only wrote about things he had personally experienced, achieving reflection by becoming part of them. I thought that a boxer’s value lies not in what he thinks, but in what he does—that is precisely the kind of life-close approach I am seeking.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:40] Baysang | I began to feel distrust toward words, questioning what literature truly means. I realized literature isn't just words—it's whatever those words awaken in the reader. I thought that Paul Celan's words matter because they lead toward an unreachable openness, something residing deep within every reader; that, perhaps, is the reason literature exists.\n[2002-03-16 14:00:45] Baysang | I found that visual art and photography were deeply important to me because they are free from concepts and words. I felt that the experience of viewing them is non-conceptual. Though I sensed it might seem intellectually 'foolish' to admit this, it might very well be the core motivation behind what I want to create.",

I turned on the hot water tap, letting the warmth spread through my palms, then dried my hands and threw the paper towel into the wastebasket. I noticed my face looked pale and slightly swollen. I stared into my eyes and saw they appeared lifeless, as if devouring everything they gazed upon. I felt a strong sense of self-scrutiny.\n[2002-03-16 14:06:00] Halvik Station Toilet | I asked myself inwardly: When exactly did I begin to develop such a gaze?\n[2002-03-16 14:10:00] Halvik Station Square | I walked out of the station and stood in the center of the square, watching the bustling crowd around me. I checked the time—it was ten to two. The center of the square was crowded with people. The gray sky looked gloomy. I knew I was supposed to meet Karl Larsdal here at five o'clock. I felt my current state was utterly terrible—weighing two hundred pounds and facing a future with no hope. But then I thought, since I’ve already made it here, that in itself was quite an achievement. I tried to make a mental plan for passing the next three hours: get a haircut, buy a scarf, grab something to eat.\n[2002-03-16 14:15:00] Harvik Railway Station exterior | I walked out of the station and stopped at the taxi drop-off point. I tried walking about a hundred meters to the left, realized something was off, then turned back. Before me stretched a gray, cold sky and damp air. To my right lay tangled roads and a concrete bridge, behind which sat a lake; to my left, a wide, busy avenue teeming with traffic, and ahead, a church. Everything on the road seemed designed for high-speed cars.\n[2002-03-16 14:16:00] Harvik Railway Station exterior | Standing by the roadside, I wondered blankly: which way should I go?\n[2002-03-16 14:20:00] Harvik Street | I stepped one foot onto a bench and rolled a cigarette, lighting it up. I walked a stretch to the left, but later turned back, deciding to try the opposite direction. I realized the previous direction was full of speeding cars, unsuitable for walking, so I decided to try a different crossing.\n[2002-03-16 14:30:00] Cultural Palace Café | I crossed the broad street and entered a glass-walled building. I took an escalator up to the second floor, bought a baguette with meatballs and red cabbage salad at the café, then sat down by the window. Across the street stood a large stone-built store. To the right rose a transparent glass building with red letters reading 'Cultural Palace.' From the window, I could see the black-and-white tiled square below and the busy streets.\n[2002-03-16 14:31:00] Cultural Palace Café | I asked myself inwardly: Should I stay here? Is this where I’m meant to live now?\n[2002-03-16 14:31:05] Cultural Palace Café | I recalled that just yesterday morning I had still been at home in Baysang. I couldn’t help but reflect: that was already yesterday.\n[2002-03-16 14:40:00] Cultural Palace Café | I sat by the window, took a bite of my bread, and shifted my gaze outside. Below me lay the black-and-white tiled square, crowded with people at the entrance of the store across the street. I saw people moving between the subway station, gallery passages, and escalators—everywhere, umbrellas, coats, and strollers in motion. Above, cars and buses flowed endlessly.\n[2002-03-16 14:50:00] Queen Street | I glanced at the clock on the mall’s outer wall—it read ten to three. I took the escalator downstairs, opened my phone to browse through my contacts, then switched it off again. I walked onto Queen Street, scanning for a barbershop as I went. I thought it best to get a haircut now, before time runs short. But I felt there was no one to contact—too much to explain, too much to account for. This weight made me choose silence.\n[2002-03-16 14:55:00] Queen Street | I passed a man playing the harmonica along the street and saw a young woman lifting a child from a stroller. Snowflakes fell to the ground and melted instantly. Outside the mall, a long-haired man was frantically playing the harmonica, his body swaying violently. A young woman carried a child wrapped in a fur sack into a shoe store. On the sidewalk sat a man holding a large sign advertising grilled steak. As I passed the harmonica player, I sensed an overwhelming aggression radiating from him, fear pounding through my veins. I noticed the child staring straight ahead, seemingly indifferent to everything around. I even felt a strange curiosity about the words on the sign: 'grilled steak.'\n[2002-03-16 15:00:00] Queen Street | I moved through the crowd, observing the passersby. I saw many women in their fifties wearing coats and carrying shopping bags from various stores. Men of the same age were fewer, mostly wearing glasses and casual jackets. Though all faces were strangers, I still felt watched. I realized I longed to be alone—but that was clearly impossible in this city.\n[2002-03-16 15:05:00] Queen Street | I wandered along Queen Street, constantly scrutinizing myself. I kept questioning myself inwardly: Is there something wrong with my coat or shoes? Is the way I walk strange? I felt like a fool, anxiety flaring inside me, as if my thoughts and emotions had gone limp and shapeless.\n[2002-03-16 15:10:00] Queen Street | I left the café and walked through the snowfall on the commercial street. I passed one brightly lit shop after another. Heavy snowflakes were falling from the sky, and the city was gradually lighting up in the darkness. Even inside the café, I couldn't find a moment's peace. I felt every gaze around me piercing into my heart like sharp thorns. I realized only constant movement could make those faces disappear quickly. I thought I just had to endure it all—because life, for me, meant nothing but getting through each moment.\n[2002-03-16 15:15:00] Barber Shop | I found a barber shop in a passageway beside the mall and sat down. The barber began cutting my hair, wetting it with water from a bottle. I told the barber to 'cut it short,' showing the length with my hand. I heard him ask what I did and where I was from, and I briefly replied that I was a student, from Leivik, and just visiting on vacation. I noticed the barber was an immigrant, and guessed he might be Kurdish.\n[2002-03-16 15:40:00] Barber Shop | I watched the cut hair fall onto the white tiles surrounding the barber’s chair. It struck me as odd that the hair on the floor was almost completely black. I realized that even though both the mirror and the fallen strands told me my hair was black, in my mind I still saw the image of myself with golden hair—the one I remembered.\n[2002-03-16 15:45:00] H&M Store | Half an hour later, I stepped out of the barber shop. I entered the men's section in the basement of an H&M store, trying to look for a scarf. I felt the cold air wrapping around my freshly trimmed head like a steel helmet. It was nearly four o'clock now, and the sky was almost completely dark.\n[2002-03-16 15:46:00] H&M Store | I went to the counter and asked a staff member where the scarves were. I heard the salesperson say to me in Mochengdao dialect that she didn’t understand, then switch to English and ask me. I said, 'Scarves.' She told me they were called 'halsdörresk' and apologized, saying, 'No. They’re out of season.'\n[2002-03-16 15:55:00] Secondhand Bookstore | I returned to the street, abandoning the idea of searching larger malls for a scarf, and instead headed toward the direction of the boarding house. Along the way, I entered a secondhand bookstore with extremely tall shelves, and discovered a book by Hölderlin among a pile of books in a corner near the counter. The bookshelves in the store were very high, placed so close together that there was barely room to turn around. I recalled the boarding house where I had stayed during that summer two years ago. I didn’t really need to buy a scarf. I was walking aimlessly, simply giving myself a walking goal.\n[2002-03-16 15:56:00] Secondhand Bookstore | I picked up the Hölderlin book and walked toward the counter. I asked the clerk, 'Is this for sale?' I heard him reply indifferently, 'Of course.' I noticed the clerk had been staring at me ever since I entered the shop.\n[2002-03-16 15:57:00] Secondhand Bookstore | I flipped through the pages, searching for information in the back cover and afterword. I saw the title was 'Sånger,' published in 2002—an unusually recent book. I guessed it might be a translation of 'Patriotic Songs.' In the afterword, I found the original German title. Though I didn’t understand why the translated title had been changed this way, I decided it didn’t really matter.\n[2002-03-16 15:58:00] Secondhand Bookstore | I paid for the book, took the small bag containing it and the receipt. I stuffed the receipt into my back pocket and left the store. I said, 'I'll take it.' I heard him ask, 'How much do you want for it?' I responded somewhat confused, 'Förlåt?' Then I heard him say, 'One hundred and fifty kronor.'",

I leaned against the wall and took out the book I’d just bought, beginning to flip through its pages. I saw the dark, wet commercial street glistening under the lights. Inside the archway lay a long garden with two restaurants and a pond. A plaque bearing the name Mochengdao Writers' Association hung on the wall. I felt the hair spray from my recent haircut running down my forehead along with the rainwater. Seeing the Writers' Association sign, I thought to myself this might be a good omen.\n[2002-03-16 16:10:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | As far as I know, Hölderlin spent his final mad years in a tower in Tübingen. I’m familiar with some scattered translations of his work in Leivik. The name Hölderlin has accompanied me for a long time. I recalled the moment Uncle Sjelten first spoke to me about Hölderlin when I was sixteen.\n[2002-03-16 16:11:00] Sogn South Bervåg Farm | From what I know, Uncle Sjelten is the only family member still living in the old house at South Bervåg. I know he works as a pipefitter at a shipyard, takes care of our sick grandmother, and manages the small farm. To me, he seems a rare kind of sensitive person, yet forced day after day to push himself through tedious and physically demanding labor.\n[2002-03-16 16:12:00] Sogn South Bervåg Farm | I understand he’s an unusually sensitive man, delicate like the most fragile flower, with no interest or talent for the practical aspects of life. I realized that every single thing forming the foundation of daily life requires him to force himself. This endurance continues day after day—I wondered if perhaps it stemmed precisely from his sensitivity.\n[2002-03-16 16:13:00] Sogn South Bervåg Farm | I know that if he had been a youth in the 1920s, he might have been influenced by the naturalist currents popular in new Leivik writing; if in the 1950s, perhaps he would have absorbed ideas from cultural radicalism or conservatism. I imagined in my mind how he might have turned out in different eras.\n[2002-03-16 16:14:00] Sogn South Bervåg Farm | I know his youth fell in the early 1970s, so he joined the Communist Workers’ Party and ‘proletarianized’ himself. He began working as a pipefitter on ships because he believed in a better world. As far as I know, he kept at it for nearly twenty years. I marveled that even as times changed, he never gave up his ideals, despite having to pay an ever-growing price for them.\n[2002-03-16 16:15:00] Sogn South Bervåg Farm | I know being a Communist in rural society is different from being one in the city. In the countryside, he was simply 'the Communist'. I realized this was his identity and his life. I felt that Sjelten, by holding on to his beliefs during a time when everyone else 'abandoned ship,' carried a loneliness that was somewhat paradoxical.\n[2002-03-16 16:15:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I remembered that ever since then, although my life has changed greatly, my attitude toward poetry has remained essentially the same. Whenever I approach the poems of great masters, I always feel like a fraud, as if the poems themselves are questioning me—what right do I have to be here?\n[2002-03-16 16:16:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I believed the way to prove one's qualification to read poetry was simple: open the book and read—if the poem opens itself to you, you’re qualified; if not, you’re not. I recalled realizing in my early twenties that I was someone poetry refused to open itself to, and this caused me deep pain, as if I’d been condemned to a lower tier of existence.\n[2002-03-16 16:17:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I thought there were three ways to deal with this sense of failure: the first is to acknowledge and accept reality. I told myself I was just an ordinary person, living a mundane life—watching sports, listening to pop music, playing drums in a band, dating women.\n[2002-03-16 16:18:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I thought the second approach would be to deny everything and turn instead to literature, for example, writing an academic paper on Hölderlin, exploring his life, political realities, translation history, or philosophical debates. I realized that all these studies could likely be completed without the poetry ever truly opening itself to the researcher.\n[2002-03-16 16:19:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I believed that between the first two methods, accepting reality was harder but better. I thought that although denying reality might be easier, it would constantly make me feel that what I was doing was worthless, and this unease made me deeply uncomfortable.\n[2002-03-16 16:20:00] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I thought the third method was based on setting the entire issue aside. I told myself there was no privileged understanding—poetry and my own writing were essentially both texts. I believed that even if my work was worse, it was merely a matter that hard work and experience could change, not some insurmountable gap.\n[2002-03-16 16:20:30] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I felt that this self-soothing way of thinking, though satisfying, was in essence the purest romanticism. I realized I had always leaned toward Baroque-era beliefs, yet deep inside I still felt myself standing at the edge of something momentous. I thought of Hölderlin’s odes and knew full well that the idea of 'art as the last sanctuary of truth and beauty' might just be a deception I was imposing on myself.\n[2002-03-16 16:20:40] Mochengdao Writers' Association archway | I sighed inwardly: Good God, how wretched I am.\n[2002-03-16 16:21:00] Harvik Street | I saw a continuous stream of people passing by the entrance. I noticed two pigeons sitting motionless on a second-floor windowsill. I pulled my phone from my jacket pocket and saw the screen was black, so I turned it on while walking. I heard faint voices and footsteps echoing between the buildings along the street. I saw lights hanging from wires above the street, reflected on the wet asphalt and metal surfaces. I saw droplets gathering at the ends of awning rods, heavy with water, occasionally falling to the ground. I wondered what time it was now.\n[2002-03-16 16:21:10] Harvik Street | I saw a text message from Toneye on my phone: 'Have you arrived? Thinking of you.'\n[2002-03-16 16:21:30] Harvik Street | I looked down at the phone screen, then deleted the message, returned the phone to the lock screen, and continued walking along Harvik Street. As I thought about those two sentences, her image suddenly appeared before me, filling my mind completely. I felt a wave of sadness wash over my entire body. I told myself I must not reply, because the whole purpose of this journey was to escape from her.\n[2002-03-16 16:21:40] Harvik Street | I checked the time—it was 16:21. I suddenly realized we were supposed to meet at four-thirty, not five, and that left less than half an hour. I silently cursed myself.\n[2002-03-16 16:26:00] Harvik Railway Station / Arlanda Express waiting room | I turned and ran desperately, stopping at an intersection to catch my breath. I turned into an alley, rushed into the airport line waiting room, passed through the lobby into the main hall. I was out of breath, bent over with my hands on my knees. I saw a yellow sign on the roadside wall marked 'Arlanda Express'. I passed a long row of newsstands, cafés, and lockers. I knew the exact time now was 16:26. I noticed a man staring at me, this panting, disheveled figure.\n[2002-03-16 16:30:00] Halvik Railway Station Hall | I straightened my body and looked up at the clock on the wall. I saw a circular railing in the center of the hall, and the wall clock was pointing exactly to sixteen thirty. I knew that was the exact place we had agreed to meet.\n[2002-03-16 16:31:00] Halvik Railway Station Hall | I took a detour, leaning against the side wall of the hall, waiting and scanning for his figure before Carl could spot me. I realized it had already been twelve years since we last met. I worried I wouldn't recognize him, and vague memories surfaced—fragments of the letters in his name, the sound of his laughter. I remembered he once laughed at me for being an existentialist, though I never really understood what that meant.\n[2002-03-16 16:32:00] Halvik Railway Station Hall | I realized I still didn't know the precise definition of 'existentialist,' and mocked myself as a master of half-knowledge.\n[2002-03-16 16:35:00] Halvik Railway Station Hall | I took off my backpack and placed it on the ground between my legs, then looked up at the clock at the far end of the hall. After waiting a while, I walked toward the internet café inside the station. I saw that the clock in the hall now showed thirty-five minutes past four. I was certain Carl was punctual—could it be we'd actually agreed on five o'clock? I felt the need to reread his email to confirm, and perhaps decipher his tone once more.\n[2002-03-16 16:40:00] Railway Station Internet Café | I walked into the café, sat down, logged into my email, and began reading through the five new messages. I heard myself ask the girl behind the counter, 'Internet?' I knew those emails were discussion threads sent by the editors of *The Wanderer*. I felt as if the debates on the screen belonged to another lifetime; I realized I had crossed some invisible boundary, and could never go back.\n[2002-03-16 16:41:00] Railway Station Internet Café | I sighed inwardly—yesterday I was still in Baysang, and now it felt as if I could never return.\n[2002-03-16 16:45:00] Railway Station Internet Café | I turned my head toward the direction of Burger King, watching two flight attendants pulling suitcases through the door. Soon I refocused on the computer screen. I heard three girls chatting nearby, and the crisp click of the flight attendants' heels on the floor. I noticed a spilled paper cup of Coke at the neighboring table, liquid dripping steadily from the edge onto the floor. A man sat with knees tightly pressed together, wolfing down a burger. I noticed one of the three girls glancing in my direction, so I quickly averted my gaze.\n[2002-03-16 16:46:00] Railway Station Internet Café | I imagined what it would be like if I never returned. Though I had always longed for this freedom, I couldn't understand why sorrow still lingered inside me.\n[2002-03-16 16:50:00] Railway Station Internet Café | I clicked open Carl's email and began reading. I read Carl's words: 'Dear Grete, brilliant idea... Halvik is one of the most beautiful capitals in the world, but not at all relaxed.' I knew Uppsala was a university town, and Mochengdao a country both hospitable and isolated. The train ride between the two took only forty to fifty minutes.\n[2002-03-16 16:51:00] Railway Station Internet Café | I continued reading the email. I saw Carl wrote: 'Getting a rental apartment won't be easy at all... Have you contacted the Mochengdao Writers' Association?' I knew housing in Uppsala was worse due to the influx of new students, but I was aware there were agencies offering second-hand apartments.\n[2002-03-16 16:52:00] train station internet cafe | I scanned the rest of the email. I read that he asked me, 'How much are you planning to pay per month? One bedroom, two bedrooms, or three?' I saw that the email was dated Saturday, March 16. Karl said Mochengdao would welcome me as long as I had income in Leivik.\n[2002-03-16 16:53:00] train station internet cafe | I saw the contact information left in the email. I read Karl urging me, 'Grete, call me as soon as you arrive in Halvik!... My number in Halvik is 708 96 93.' I learned that Uppsala University was founded in 1477. In his letter, Karl joked that he selfishly wanted to speak more Leivik dialect with me.\n[2002-03-16 16:54:00] train station internet cafe | I reached the final part of the email. I saw Karl wrote, 'So we’ve agreed—we’ll meet at Central Station at 17:00 today... I’ll see you there.' I learned that locals called the circular railing in the center of the station hall the 'chrysanthemum ring'.\n[2002-03-16 16:55:00] train station internet cafe | I knew he was from Hisøy. I didn’t doubt his sincerity, but still found it hard to accept his invitation to live together. I thought it might be better to first find a place for coffee, though on second thought, there was no harm in trying.\n[2002-03-16 16:55:10] train station internet cafe | I closed the webpage, grabbed my backpack, stood up, and glanced at the three girls. I heard one of the girls speaking in an indignant tone. I had originally thought they were nineteen, but now realized they couldn’t have been more than fifteen.\n[2002-03-16 16:55:20] train station internet cafe | I saw one of the girls turn her head and meet my gaze. Though she gave me no friendly expression, in that fleeting moment of eye contact, I felt a brief spark of joy.\n[2002-03-16 16:56:00] train station internet cafe | I walked to the counter to pay, standing and waiting in front of it. I thought about how my father, at thirty-three, already had two sons, a house, a car, and a stable job. It suddenly struck me that I was now thirty-three too. I was startled by why I was still thinking like someone twenty years old, and wished those youthful fantasies would finally leave me.",

    "text": "[2002-03-16 16:56:10] train station internet cafe cashier | I pressed my warm hand against the cool marble countertop; the cashier rose from her chair and came toward me. I heard myself ask, 'How much?', and the cashier replied, 'Ten.' Hearing the cashier reply again with 'Usaikeda?', I couldn't help but sigh.\n[2002-03-16 16:56:30] train station internet cafe cashier | I handed her a twenty-kroner bill and walked away without waiting for change. I heard myself say, 'Keep the change.' I wanted to leave quickly, so she wouldn’t ask me 'Usaikeda?' again.\n[2002-03-16 16:58:00] train station hall | I returned to my previous spot and let my eyes wander across the hall. I saw the wall clock showing six minutes to five. A group of idle people stood by the tracks. I absentmindedly watched the passing crowd, feeling none of them worth a second glance.\n[2002-03-16 16:59:00] train station hall | I stared intently at a man passing by until he disappeared down the stairs. I saw a man with a large head and a small frame, wearing a formal coat and carrying a briefcase. I thought this man’s appearance was both utterly ordinary and strangely unusual, like a goblin. I wondered if beneath his urban exterior, another self was struggling to move forward.\n[2002-03-16 16:59:30] train station hall | I watched the steady flow of people in the hall. I heard the noisy chatter of people in the hall. I saw the constantly changing destination boards, the automatic doors, and the laptops slung over people’s shoulders. It suddenly struck me that everything here was old—backs, hands, feet, even joy were all worn out. I mused that although the technology was new, it was 'old age' that ruled this space that rejected it.\n[2002-03-16 16:59:40] train station hall | I reached into my pocket to make sure the locker key was still there, then patted my chest to confirm my credit card was safe. I realized how terrible a thought had just crossed my mind.\n[2002-03-16 16:59:50] train station hall | I spotted a familiar face emerging from the crowded stream of people; he was holding a train ticket and checking the time on the departure board. I recognized him as the man I’d seen earlier at Burger King. My heart began to race—I first thought it was Karl Larsdal—and when I realized it was the stranger, I couldn’t help but grin.\n[2002-03-16 17:00:00] train station hall near the circular railing | I scanned all the approaching faces in the crowd and finally saw Karl Larsdal. I smiled, rubbed the sweat off my palms on my thighs, stopped in front of him, and held out my hand. I heard myself say: 'Hi, Karl Larsdal, long time no see.' I saw the clock on the wall pointing to exactly five o’clock. The moment I saw his face, I recognized him.\n[2002-03-16 17:00:10] train station hall | I saw him smile back, reach out to shake my hand, and then we walked together toward the café by the main entrance. I told him my luggage was in a locker downstairs. I heard him laugh loudly: 'You haven’t changed a bit, just like back in Baysang.' He then suggested, 'Let’s go, grab a coffee first?' I replied, 'Sure, anywhere is fine.'\n[2002-03-16 17:05:00] café by the train station entrance | I followed him into the café, took off my backpack, sat down, pulled out my tobacco pouch, and watched him pay and pour coffee at the counter. I noticed he was in a restless, constantly moving physical state. I noticed he didn’t have the broad, boxer-like build I had imagined. As far as I knew, he used to be a boxer. I realized that although I recognized him, his demeanor was different from what I expected—he seemed constantly looking around, uneasy.\n[2002-03-16 17:06:00] café by the train station entrance | I felt an intense drowsiness, a desire to find an empty room, lie down, and vanish from the world. The thought of having to socialize and make small talk for the next few hours felt unbearable.\n[2002-03-16 17:10:00] café by the train station entrance | I watched the lights from the station hall reflect off glass, metal, and marble, and saw hundreds of people drifting through the shadows. I knew I had spent eight years with Tonje, and I thought of my brother Henrik Inge and his children. I sighed. Though everything around me should have made me happy, I realized I had been indifferent to life, beauty, and friends for a long time. I longed to feel joy again.\n[2002-03-16 17:15:00] café by the train station entrance | I licked the edge of the rolling paper to seal the cigarette and lit it. I watched Karl standing there holding two coffee cups while the waitress called the next customer. I saw the next customer was a long-haired man in his fifties wearing a coat resembling a South American poncho. I noticed the café smelled of light brown tobacco and fresh coffee.\n[2002-03-16 17:16:00] train station entrance café | I observed that Karl didn't look like a boxer at all; he avoided eye contact and seemed restless, as if wanting to keep moving without pause.\n[2002-03-16 17:17:00] train station entrance café | I watched him approach with two cups of coffee, pull out a chair, and sit down. I heard him ask, 'So you're moving to Halvik then?' I replied, 'Looks that way.' Looking at him, I couldn't help but smile.\n[2002-03-16 17:18:00] train station entrance café | I watched him grip the handle of his cup, blow on the coffee, and take a sip. I heard him exclaim, 'Thank goodness. I've always hoped someone from Leivik who cares about literature would move here.' I noticed that while speaking, his eyes remained fixed on the tabletop, never meeting mine.\n[2002-03-16 17:20:00] train station entrance café | I told him, 'That summer you went to Uppsala, I wrote you a long letter but never sent it—it's still sealed to this day.' I heard him cry out in surprise, 'You're kidding! Don't open it—leave it as frozen time.' I knew that letter was written by me during the summer of 1989. I realized I no longer remembered what I had written in that letter.\n[2002-03-16 17:21:00] train station entrance café | I nodded at him in response to his words. I told him, 'I burned all the diaries and manuscripts I wrote during that period.' I heard him ask in disbelief, 'Burned? Not just thrown away—but actually burned?' He then remarked that I was still very dramatic when I left for Baysang, but when I challenged him, he denied being that way himself. I realized I could no longer recall a single thing from that period.\n[2002-03-16 17:25:00] train station entrance café | I tapped the ash from my cigarette into the ashtray, glancing at him roughly every now and then. I heard him laugh heartily and ask, 'Do you know Halvik at all?' I shook my head and told him, 'Not really—I've only been here a few hours.' I saw the door opening and closing, cigarette smoke gently swirling in the air currents. I noticed Karl’s gaze was dull and filled with sadness, yet his expression appeared cheerful and shy. I found that the impression he gave had nothing to do with his actual face.\n[2002-03-16 17:30:00] train station entrance café | I heard Karl launch into a lengthy critique of Mochengdao, saying it was cold as ice and that there was an unbreakable 'yellow line' between people. He contrasted the sloppiness of Leivik scholars with the neatness of Mochengdao's academic circles, and complained that nobody here cared about Leivik. Following the direction of his nod, I saw orderly crowds standing on the escalator. I knew that in Mochengdao, people stand on the right side of the escalator while those walking use the left. I thought such an extremely rule-bound social environment could indeed drive a person mad.\n[2002-03-16 17:35:00] train station entrance café | I watched Karl bring the coffee cup to his lips and take a small sip. I heard him continue talking about how everyone here lives neatly and publicly, mentioning that the poor, the rich, and the mentally ill are all assigned to specific zones. I didn’t know what to say. My intuition told me these smooth, fluent words were more like a prepared speech born of frustration. I felt he could say whatever he wanted—I didn’t really care.\n[2002-03-16 17:40:00] train station entrance café | I heard Karl contrasting the cultural differences between the two places—he said Leivik undervalued intellect and prized sports, whereas Mochengdao revered intellect and strictly separated popular culture from elite culture. He brought up the example of the talkative Leivik bus driver to illustrate how strongly Mochengdao people identify with their social roles. I knew he was describing the vast gap between Leivik and Mochengdao in terms of social roles and cultural perception.\n[2002-03-16 17:45:00] train station entrance café | I stubbed out my cigarette paper, finished the last sip of coffee, put on my coat, slung my backpack over my shoulder, and followed him into the station hall. I asked him, 'Then why do you live here?' I heard him answer with a wandering gaze, 'It's a perfect country—as long as you want to be left alone. I despise it, yet I benefit from it.' Then he suggested, 'Shall we go?' I responded, 'Yeah, let's go.'\n[2002-03-16 17:46:00] train station hall | I walked around to his other side as he had suggested. I noticed that he walked with his feet slightly turned outward, like a duck's, which reminded me of a former ballet-dancing girlfriend. I heard him turn his head and say to me, \"Could you walk on that side? I can't hear well with this ear.\" I realized this gait was just like that of a ballet dancer.\n[2002-03-16 17:50:00] underground plaza of the train station | I pointed down to show him where the bag was, then followed him toward the stairs. I observed the behavior of the people around us, feeling it wasn't any different from those at Bergen Central Station. I heard him ask, \"Where is your bag?\" I replied, \"Down there, then turn right.\" I thought that the subtle differences Karl mentioned were probably only noticeable after years of wandering.\n[2002-03-16 17:51:00] underground plaza of the train station | I saw him glance at me and give that smug 'I-know-more-than-you' smirk. I said to him, \"This place looks quite like Leivik—like encountering another version of Leivik.\" I heard him laugh in response, \"We'll see.\" I realized how intolerable I found that kind of superior 'I-know-better' attitude.\n[2002-03-16 17:52:00] underground plaza of the train station | I stopped and pointed up at the electronic bulletin board above us. I explained to Karl that seeing place names like Uppsala, Gothenburg, and Nynäshamn on the timetable filled me with an exotic charm. I told him, \"This is why I came here. This is exactly why.\" I saw the signboard continuously flashing the names of various Mochengdao towns. I found the incredibly similar yet subtly different variations between Mochengdao and Leivik irresistibly fascinating.\n[2002-03-16 17:53:00] underground plaza of the train station | I watched him stare at me in disbelief, then burst out laughing. We continued walking forward. I heard him laugh and say, \"You're crazy.\" I kept explaining the cultural differences behind these similar landscapes, mentioning comparisons between rural Japan, rural Maine in the United States, and Leivik. I asked him, \"Do you get what I mean?\" He answered, \"No, but I'm listening.\" I felt completely surprised by my own words, but I realized I needed to find a reason for myself to stay.",

    "text": "[2002-03-16 17:55:00] locker room / subway platform | We entered the underground plaza, I pulled two bags from the lockers, and Karl helped carry one. Then we walked together toward the subway platform a few hundred meters away. I saw the underground plaza still bustling with people.\n[2002-03-16 18:25:00] Vestertorp Street | Half an hour later, we walked through the center of Vestertorp. I looked at the shops and buildings along the street, occasionally catching glimpses of distant mountains and lakes. I heard subway station announcements weaving through Karl's conversation. I heard Karl talk nonstop all along the way about everything we saw. Unfamiliar yet beautiful station names rang in my ears: Slussen, Liljeholmen, Telefonplan… I saw streetlights illuminating the March darkness, and the buildings were square brick structures from the 1950s. Many windows glowed with light. I knew this place was called Vestertorp, a well-preserved suburban town.\n[2002-03-16 18:30:00] outside Karl Larsdal's door | I followed him through a gate and climbed the stairs into the apartment. I saw neat bookshelves on the wall and a row of tightly hung jackets. I heard him point at a house by the roadside and say, \"Here we are.\" I smelled the scent of someone else’s life lived here.\n[2002-03-16 18:31:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I saw a woman sitting behind a desk in the room to the left look up, pencil in hand. I stepped forward. I heard Karl greet Kristina and introduce me. Kristina smiled and said, \"So happy to meet you—I've heard so much about you!\" I responded, \"I'm actually embarrassed—I haven't really heard much about you, though I've seen a little in Karl's books.\"\n[2002-03-16 18:35:00] Karl Larsdal's apartment | I followed Karl as he showed me around the apartment, watching him open a glass cabinet to display his book collection. Kristina brought us coffee. I saw the apartment had two rooms, each with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Karl's books were arranged with extreme precision, as if measured with a ruler, sorted by series and author. I learned that one room served as the living room and Kristina's workspace, while the other was both bedroom and Karl's study.\n[2002-03-16 18:40:00] Karl Larsdal's bedroom | I looked at Karl, and he smiled back. I said to him, \"You're very organized, I can see that.\" I heard him reply that everything in his life was planned. I remarked, \"That sounds scary.\" He countered that meeting someone like me, who says something one day and moves in the next, was even scarier. I responded, \"I had to.\"\n[2002-03-16 18:45:00] Karl Larsdal's bedroom | I listened to Karl speaking and shook my head at him. I heard Karl quote lines from Ibsen’s plays, talking about hope and necessity. He mentioned Beckett’s opinion on that play and asked if I’d read it. I replied, \"I haven’t read a single one of his historical dramas.\" I knew he was discussing Ibsen's *Emperor and Galilean*. I found myself drawn to the past era he described, one connected through ideas.\n[2002-03-16 18:50:00] Karl Larsdal's bedroom | I saw him gesturing wildly as he spoke, and I shook my head at him. I heard him passionately argue how Ibsen rehabilitated Catiline and compared him to Quisling. He asked if I remembered Bjørnson’s *King Sigurd the Bad*, and I answered, \"I don’t know anything about Bjørnson.\" I knew he was discussing the philosophical theme of actor versus observer, referencing works by Schiller, Kleist, and others.\n[2002-03-16 18:55:00] Karl Larsdal's bedroom | I noticed that after this silence, he broke the stillness by speaking up. I heard him say he was probably more of an observer, and asked for my opinion. I answered simply, \"Observer.\" Then I heard him say that I was in Baysang yesterday and here today—perhaps this was a way of deciding things by just letting them happen. The room fell into a silence. I realized that coming here hadn’t been the result of any deliberate action on my part, but rather felt like being driven by fate.\n[2002-03-16 19:00:00] Karl Larsdal's bedroom | I heard him remark how strange it was, and mention that the boxer in his writing possessed astonishing presence, yet lost all memory because he refused to remember the pain of heavy blows. He pointed out that the life of reflection and the life of action were two different forms, calling it the old dilemma that haunts every observer.\n[2002-03-16 19:05:00] Karl Larsdal's kitchen | I saw Kristina peek her head into the room. Then Karl and I walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table, looking out the window. I heard Kristina ask if we wanted coffee, and I said, \"Yes.\" I asked what she had been drawing, and she told me she was sketching shoe designs for a small shoe factory in northern Mochengdao. I saw the empty road beneath the streetlights outside the window. The absurdity of sitting in the kitchen of a suburban town with two strangers suddenly struck me, and I silently asked myself: What am I doing here?\n[2002-03-16 19:30:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I sat in the living room, watching Kristina begin to prepare dinner. I heard myself telling Karl about Tonje and my life in Baysang. I also heard him summarize his experiences over the past thirteen years, especially his literary quarrels in the *Mochengdao Daily*, and even his joke about wanting to pee on the gates of Uppsala Castle. I learned that he had left Baysang thirteen years ago. I realized I loved hearing him talk about those rebellious episodes from the past most of all.\n[2002-03-16 20:30:00] Karl Larsdal's kitchen | I wolfed down minced lamb burgers and fried potatoes like a starving animal; my plate emptied quickly. We drank some alcohol, and I nodded along at them. I heard Kristina apologize, and I responded with a counter-apology. We talked about the differences between Mochengdao and Leivik. I secretly thought that neither Mochengdao nor Leivik was really as they described, but I went along with them anyway. I realized Kristina and I were the same kind of person.\n[2002-03-16 23:00:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I smoothed out the sheet, preparing to sleep on the sofa in the living room, staring at Karl’s face. I tried hard to keep his features fixed in my sight. It was now around eleven at night, and I could feel my eyes struggling to stay open. I noticed his face suddenly looked completely different, then shifted back to normal—this confused me.\n[2002-03-16 23:05:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I tucked the last edge of the sheet under the mattress, then sat down on the sofa. I noticed my hands were trembling uncontrollably. I thought in alarm: What’s going on?\n[2002-03-16 23:10:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I watched him turn his head toward me and sit down on the other side of the table. I heard him say that my novel had left an unforgettable and shocking impression on him. Puzzled, I asked, \"Why do you say that?\" I noticed his face had changed back to the way it looked when I first saw him at the central station.\n[2002-03-16 23:15:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I heard him comment that I had gone too far—so far it was unbelievable. He remarked that only I had truly followed through on the idea of becoming a writer, but this extreme distance frightened him, and he said he would never go that far. I saw him sitting there with a smiling face.\n[2002-03-16 23:16:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I pressed on, \"What do you mean? What do you mean I've gone too far?\" I argued that it was just an ordinary novel. But I heard him insist that I had revealed horrifying things about myself—it wasn't just the story of that thirteen-year-old boy. I realized he was genuinely frightened by what I had written.\n[2002-03-16 23:20:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I stared into his eyes. I felt a chill inside and said, \"I don't quite understand what you're talking about—I made it up.\" But then I heard him laugh and remind me that in Baysang, I had told him about that affair, comparing myself to Lieutenant Gran, and about my time as a teacher in North Leivik with a thirteen-year-old student. I knew he was referring to what happened after I returned from North Leivik the previous summer.\n[2002-03-16 23:21:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I forced a weak smile and said, \"Well, that's not really funny either.\" I heard him drop his smile and ask if I didn't remember, pointing out that the party scene described in the novel was exactly as I had once described it to him, and he marveled that I had actually written it down.\n[2002-03-16 23:25:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I looked at him, feeling deeply shaken. I heard him ask what was wrong, saying I looked like I'd seen a ghost. I shot back, \"You're not serious, are you? You actually believed what I said?\" But he answered firmly, \"Yes, I did. That's exactly how you put it. It's etched in my memory.\" Still, I insisted it wasn't true.\n[2002-03-16 23:30:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I felt a piercing pain, as if pierced by countless arrows. I couldn't understand why he would say such a thing. Inside, I frantically denied it, convinced I could never have buried and forgotten such a significant truth. It was utterly unimaginable to me.\n[2002-03-16 23:31:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I watched him stand up, look at me, and shake his head with a faint smile. I heard him say, \"I'm sorry, Grete, but you really did say it.\" Dazed, I replied, \"I don't understand, but you don't seem to be lying.\" Finally, I heard him wish me a good night’s sleep, and I responded, \"You too.\"\n[2002-03-16 23:40:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I lay awake on the sofa, staring into the depths of the room. I heard the rustling sounds of the couple undressing and getting into bed in their bedroom. The room was filled with dim light seeping in from the streetlamps outside. Occasionally, I caught the low groan of a subway passing hundreds of meters away, and the distant highway roared like the ocean. His words had pierced me like a thousand arrows, leaving a dull ache throughout my body. I tried to find a solution, but intense emotions were accusing me from within.\n[2002-03-17 01:00:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I remembered waking up once in a shelter, with police suspecting me of breaking in and stealing money, and I insisted it wasn't me. I knew that during my time in the north, I often drank myself into oblivion, losing entire nights of memory. I learned I sometimes woke up wearing clothes that weren’t mine, or found myself sleeping on rooftops or under shrubs. Though I refused to accept Karl's accusation, I realized there were indeed huge black holes in my memory. I felt overwhelming guilt over my past recklessness, and this uncertainty made it impossible for me to deny his claims with a clear conscience.\n[2002-03-17 02:00:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I know I've been with Toneye for eight years now, married for six. Until yesterday, we still shared the same bed. I'm thinking about my relationship with Toneye, wondering whether our life together has truly ended or if it's just a temporary pause. I realize she's still the person closest to me, yet I have no idea what I truly want.\n[2002-03-17 03:00:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I lie on the sofa, closing and then opening my eyes again. I stare at that shifting face. I feel a face appear behind the glass door of the balcony, then vanish. Then more faces emerge in hallucination, noses turning into beaks, eyes becoming those of birds of prey. I am now in the suburbs of Hårvik, a place where I don't know a single soul. I feel inner chaos and unease. I sense this uncertainty is defining who I am. I notice an eagle perched inside my chest, glaring fiercely.\n[2002-03-17 04:00:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I turn over, lying sideways on the sofa. I just want to be a decent person, but I realize things aren't that simple. I admit I’ve been a deserter before, done terrible things, and now once again I’ve run away.\n[2002-03-17 07:00:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I wake up to his shouting, sit up, and glare at him sitting at the other end of the sofa. I hear him shout, 'Good morning! It’s already seven!' I snap back, 'I usually don’t get up until one in the afternoon, and I don’t talk to anyone for at least an hour after that.' I see him approaching with a cup of steaming hot coffee.\n[2002-03-17 07:05:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I take the coffee and sip it cautiously. I hear him exclaim, 'What rotten luck,' and explain that he isn’t a mere observer of life—he’s good at observing others but never himself. He asks if I want coffee, and I reply, 'I usually drink tea in the morning, but for your sake, I’ll drink this.'\n[2002-03-17 07:10:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I nod twice and take another sip of coffee. I hear him continue yesterday’s conversation, discussing the failures of The Emperor and Galilean and Also Sprach Zarathustra, emphasizing how important the expression behind such failure really is. I notice he keeps watching me, as if expecting a response.\n[2002-03-17 07:15:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I shrug my shoulders. I hear him bring up my novel again, saying what shocked him was my courage to confront myself. I respond coolly, 'It has nothing to do with me—I care about myself.' Then I hear him counter by asking how many people would actually do the same. I see him gesturing wildly from the other end of the sofa. I want to curl back into the sofa and go to sleep.\n[2002-03-17 07:20:00] Karl Larsdal's living room | I watch him rise to his feet. I hear him suggest going into town, showing me Hårvik—beautiful though soulless. I reply, 'Alright, but not right away, surely? What time is it now?' He tells me it’s past eight ten and urges me to get dressed for breakfast. I know Christina is making ham omelets.\n[2002-03-17 08:30:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I try to delay leaving, but eventually he pulls me up anyway. I hear Karl mercilessly urge, 'A little walk will do you good—staying indoors all the time will kill you... Let’s go now!' I don’t want to get up from the sofa at all, and even if forced awake, I don’t want to go outside.\n[2002-03-17 09:00:00] Vestertop Street | I follow behind him toward the subway station. I see him turn and flash me a grin. I hear him press, 'Now you’ve pulled those memories of North Leivik out of your subconscious, right? Or still nothing?' I choose to interpret his grimace as a smile.\n[2002-03-17 09:01:00] Vestertop Street | I followed him as we walked along the street. I said to him, 'Before I went to sleep, I sorted out that relationship in my mind... I found relief.' I explained that he had mixed up three different stories—I did have a girlfriend once, but she was fifteen or sixteen at the time, definitely not thirteen. I realized that for a while I actually believed he was right—that I had suppressed memories—but now I felt relieved.\n[2002-03-17 09:02:00] Vestertop Street | I walked along Vestertop's streets. I heard him retort, 'You said you were in love with one of your students.' I insisted it was impossible. But he firmly told me, 'Of course you did, Grete, I'm not an idiot.'",

    "text": "[2002-03-17 09:05:00] Subway station | I stopped at the ticket gate to buy a ticket, then followed him down the long concrete underground passage toward the platform. I said to him, 'There was a girl who fell in love with me, I remember. That’s probably what you’re remembering too. So you’ve confused her with the girlfriend I actually dated.' I heard him reply, 'Maybe so, but that’s not how you described it back then.'\n[2002-03-17 09:06:00] Subway station | I heard myself say to him, 'Please, just stop it—I didn’t come to Halvik to suffer again.' I also heard him assure me, 'Then you’ve come to the right person; I won’t say another word.' I just wanted to get far away from those painful questions.\n[2002-03-17 10:00:00] Halvik city center | I took the subway into the city and spent the whole day going in and out of different stations, wandering around various places. I saw new cityscapes unfolding each time, every scene strikingly beautiful. I felt unable to piece these images together—Halvik was just fragments to me, disconnected and separate.\n[2002-03-17 10:00:00] Karl Larsdal's home | I called her from Karl and Kristina’s apartment. I knew she was the only person I knew in Halvik besides Karl. As a writer, she surely knew many people who might offer accommodation. I remembered that the past with Bischoffs-Aaln was long dead, and I felt nothing for her anymore, but I now urgently needed to use this connection to find a place to stay.\n[2002-03-17 10:05:00] Karl Larsdal's home | I heard no answer on the other end of the line, so I hung up. I noticed Karl pretending not to hear, and then I tried several more times, but never got through. I told Karl, 'Nobody’s home.' I heard him suggest I try again later.\n[2002-03-18 12:00:00] Halvik city center | I walked beside him, turning left and right as he directed. I heard him speak all the way in a loud, enthusiastic voice, delighting in everything he saw. When I suggested, out of boredom, switching sides and walking on the right instead of the left, I heard him smile and say, 'Sure, if it makes you happy.' Sometimes I grew tired of this unbalanced power dynamic, where he decided everything.\n[2002-03-19 13:00:00] Halvik restaurant | I had lunch with him every day in a different place. As far as I knew, Karl and Kristina often dined out—the food here was nearly free compared to Leivik, and there were countless options. My instinct was to go eat at the student café, but I saw Karl refuse, saying he no longer wanted anything to do with youth culture.\n[2002-03-20 10:00:00] Halvik | With Kristina’s help, I placed a rental ad in the newspaper. I gradually turned down apartments on the outskirts of town, eventually first moving into an apartment in Nørstet, then into that distinctly feminine room. I learned that Kristina believed the label 'writer' would attract fanatics, while 'Leivik' stood for approachability. She proved to be right—the phone calls overwhelmed me. I felt it made no sense to remain trapped in some tower deep in the forest.\n[2002-03-20 15:00:00] Harvik city center | I followed his request and went to contact all the Mochengdao people I had met during my time at The Wanderer and as editor. I heard him nagging constantly in my ear, saying that finding a place was absolutely necessary because securing a foothold in the city required connections. I didn't really want to contact anyone—I just wanted to sleep and wander around.\n[2002-03-21 19:00:00] Poetry reading event venue | I attended a large poetry reading. I saw a drunk Russian man staggering on stage, eventually embracing and reconciling passionately with his translator. I heard Leivik poet Inge shout 'Harvik, hello!' and also heard the Russian man yelling on stage, 'You all hate poetry!' I also heard his Mochengdao translator trying hard to calm him down. The venue gathered writers from Baywick, Leivik, Mochengdao, and Russia. I felt embarrassed for my country at Inge's rock-star-like opening.\n[2002-03-21 21:00:00] Backstage of the reading | I managed to sneak backstage and asked the Mochengdao writers present about accommodation. I heard that school principal Bjorn Jens was also in the audience. I heard Ratama promise me he had an apartment I could move into next week. I learned that Bjorn knew everyone, so I got backstage through him.\n[2002-03-21 22:00:00] Malmene Hotel | I went with the group to the Malmene Hotel. I heard poet Christianlund ask me why someone should read my novel, and I replied that perhaps because it was a book you could get into right away. Then I saw her politely smile. I noticed she soon began scanning the room to find someone else to talk to, realizing she was a poet, while I was merely a writer of light fiction.\n[2002-03-21 23:30:00] Christianlund's home | I went with everyone to her place for drinks. I saw Karl eventually part ways unhappily with Silkeberg. I heard Karl hint that the rent for that central apartment was quite high. I noticed Karl’s deep contempt for poets and poetry, his gaze toward them clearly filled with disdain.\n[2002-03-22 01:00:00] Slussen Street | I walked toward Slussen in the early hours of the morning. I heard Karl talk about the privileges of the cultural middle class, ideology, and how they damage quality. I occasionally argued back, calling him paranoid and nitpicky. I found myself unable to connect his words to reality, sometimes just letting him talk on.\n[2002-03-22 01:15:00] Slussen subway station | I was about to pass through the ticket gate and step onto the escalator. I heard him comment, 'Sigrid Ingrid is unique, truly outstanding.' I replied, 'Yes.' I knew he usually held reservations toward mainstream opinions, but this time he spoke highly of her.\n[2002-03-22 01:20:00] Subway platform | I heard him exclaim, 'She belongs to a completely different class—world-class.' I felt the wind from the approaching train below lifting plastic bags on the platform. I saw the train emerge like a beast, its lights glowing like eyes in the dark.\n[2002-03-22 01:21:00] Subway platform | I saw a short, plump elderly woman with a handbag over her arm drinking at the bar. I recalled having no special impression of her during her reading, but before it began, I had been quite curious about her.\n[2002-03-22 01:25:00] Subway carriage | I stepped onto the platform and walked toward the train now pulling in and stopping. I told him, 'Butterfly Valley is a sequence of sonnets, the strictest form.' I heard Karl reply that Hadler had once tried to explain it, but he simply couldn’t remember.\n[2002-03-22 01:26:00] subway carriage | I entered the carriage and sat down opposite him. I said to him, \"Calvino did the same thing in If on a winter's night a traveler—each title forms another story.\" I heard the sound of the doors opening, then the train began to move.\n[2002-03-22 01:30:00] subway carriage | I heard Karl refuse, \"You can keep Calvino, Borges, and that sort of thing for yourself—I don't like fantasy literature or constructed narratives.\" I countered by asking what then made Kristensen any different, and suggested he take a longer-term view of such constructive writers.\n[2002-03-22 01:31:00] subway carriage | I looked out the window, feeling the train accelerating. I heard Karl insist he didn't hear any construction. I told him it was because the sounds being heard were covering the rules, just like Borges. I asked if he wanted to read it, and heard his firm reply: \"No.\"\n[2002-03-22 01:40:00] subway carriage | I sat with him in silence. I saw passengers casting one hollow gaze after another. I felt the walls and floor of the train trembling slightly. I felt bound by this shared silence among all the passengers.\n[2002-03-22 01:45:00] subway carriage | I was leaving the station aboard the train. I heard him comment that attending a poetry reading was like going to a hospital packed with lunatics. I asked whether Kristensen was the same, he denied it, but insisted this evening had been a waste of time for her.\n[2002-03-22 01:46:00] subway carriage | I said to him, \"The guy with the apartment—was he called Rattama?\"",

    "text": "[2002-03-24 09:00:00] rented room | That morning, I dialed the number Rattama had given me. Over the next two days, I kept trying repeatedly, but no one ever answered.\n[2002-03-24 20:00:00] bar | I went to another bar where he had an event and waited. When I saw him come out, I approached, noticing he lowered his head upon recognizing me. I heard him tell me regretfully that it was too late—the apartment was already gone.\n[2002-03-25 12:00:00] restaurant | I met with editors from the publishing house over lunch, arranged through Ingeborg Bu. I learned they gave me a list of easy-to-work-with writers, and was told I could stay at the publisher's guest room for two weeks.\n[2002-03-25 14:00:00] Norstedts Publishing House guest room | I moved into the publisher's guest room. I found out that Cilia Tor had given me an encouraging reply—because a girl I knew from Text Front was leaving town for a month, I could stay there.\n[2002-03-26 10:00:00] rented room | I called Toneye every now and then. I heard her tell me what was happening on her end, and I told her about my life too. But I realized neither of us brought up the question of what exactly we were doing.\n[2002-03-27 08:00:00] Søndre Landevei | I started running along Søndre Landevei and began writing again. I realized it had been four years since my first novel was published. I realized that during these four years, I had accomplished nothing.\n[2002-03-27 10:00:00] rented room | I knew the novel I had previously started writing was about a summer night when I was twelve, going crabbing with my father and brother out on the skerries. I lay on the waterbed in the rented room, wavering between two ideas: whether to write a diary-like account of the present—the 'Håvik Diary'—or continue working on the novel about that summer night catching crabs. I realized that while the crab-catching story had atmosphere, it probably wouldn't be enough to carry a full-length novel.\n[2002-03-28 12:00:00] Håvik | During the day I stayed in bed reading, occasionally receiving visits from Karl Larsdal and having lunch together; at night I focused on writing, running, or took the train to their house. I heard our conversations always revolved around literature, or various political and ideological topics initiated by Karl Larsdal. I realized that over these two weeks, I had grown closer to Karl and Kristina.\n[2002-03-28 14:00:00] Karl Larsdal's home | I learned that Karl came from a working-class background, while I grew up in a middle-class family; when he got into fights at school and was punished, I was busy trying to please the teachers; when he was considering joining the military, I was writing revolutionary poetry. I knew his story only gradually emerged after he began to trust me. I found myself with endless things to say about the past—my father’s death, summers in Sørberge—all vivid in my mind. I realized Karl’s story was completely different from mine, and that he always seemed sharp, perceptive, and detached.\n[2002-03-28 16:00:00] Karl Larsdal's home | I realized we got along extremely well, that we truly understood each other. I thought this was the first time since adulthood I could open up completely to someone.\n[2002-04-02 14:00:00] Branxholmgata 92 | I went to view an apartment in Søndre Landevei, and outside saw twin sisters who looked identical get out of a car. I greeted them, went upstairs together, and signed the lease on the spot. I heard them say they were from Poland and planned to sublet the apartment for at least a year. I responded that it sounded good.\n[2002-04-02 14:30:00] Branxholmgata 92 | I slowly walked downstairs and stopped in front of the tenant list posted inside the building, scanning through the names. Before me was a roughly thirty-square-meter one-and-a-half-room apartment with kitchen and bathroom, in what seemed like a perfect location. I saw the address: Branxholmgata 92. I thought the apartment was quite nice, but I also realized something was bothering me—I felt as though I had seen this address before.\n[2002-04-02 14:35:00] Branxholmgata 92 | I knew this was the address I had once sent a letter to, requesting a contribution. I saw the name 'Nils Nils·Bostrom' clearly listed, silently cursed under my breath, and felt a chill run down my spine. I realized this was actually her address.\n[2002-04-02 14:40:00] Branxholmgata 92 | I knew this city had one and a half million people, and I only knew one of them. I marveled inwardly at the odds of such a coincidence. I realized that by simply responding to a random ad, I had ended up finding an apartment in the same building as someone I knew.\n[2002-04-02 15:00:00] subway/rented room | I walked heavily to the subway station, restless in my seat on the way back. I knew something terrible had happened in Bischoffsheim-Alne before. I thought if I moved into the apartment above her, she'd definitely think I was stalking her. I realized such a thing was absolutely out of the question.\n[2002-04-02 15:30:00] rented room | As soon as I got home, I called the Polish sisters. I heard myself apologizing, telling them I'd changed my mind because better conditions had come up. I heard them respond, 'It's okay.'\n[2002-04-02 19:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I heard Karl Larsdal shout at me, 'Are you crazy?' He said it was like tripping over gold to find a cheap apartment in that neighborhood, and I shouldn't turn it down for such a reason. I told Karl about it, and I could feel his disbelief.\n[2002-04-02 19:10:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I said to Karl, 'Anyway, it's done. Can I come by often? I feel like you're family.' I heard him laugh and reply that he felt the same, but thought our relationship was more like Caesar and Brutus—he joked I'd eventually stab him in the back.\n[2002-04-02 20:00:00] Karl Larsdal's balcony | After dinner, I stood on the small balcony smoking and drinking coffee, watching as Karl Larsdal came out too. I heard us discussing the impact of post-structuralism on worldviews. Karl told me he had an acquaintance who stopped speaking to him over an argument about the real and the relative. I silently thought that being so serious about such strange issues seemed unnecessary.\n[2002-04-02 20:30:00] Karl Larsdal's balcony | I heard Karl say he wasn't interested in anything except society and people. I told him I was fascinated by trees, crystals, stones, even patterns in clouds. Hearing him burst out laughing and call it boring, I suggested, 'Shall we go inside?' I realized I was deeply curious about fractal structures in nature.\n[2002-04-02 21:00:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I poured myself another cup of coffee. I asked Karl Larsdal if I could use the phone. I heard him answer, 'Of course, who are you calling?' I told him it was Nils Nils. He replied, 'Ah, the woman who made you give up the apartment.'\n[2002-04-02 21:05:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I heard Nils Nils' voice on the other end. I introduced myself as Grete Lundnes. I told her I was in Halvik. I heard her exclaim that was cool, and mentioned she'd been in Visby writing. I learned she hadn't been in the city for a while. I hadn't expected this call to actually go through.\n[2002-04-02 21:10:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I said to her, 'Would you like to have coffee sometime?' I heard her happily agree, and we arranged to meet tomorrow at noon at the café next to Nitotogt. After a long silence, I finally issued the invitation.\n[2002-04-02 21:15:00] Karl Larsdal's house | I hung up and walked toward Karl Larsdal, seeing him standing there holding his cup, watching me. I heard him ask, 'Well? Finally hooked her?' I told him I was meeting her tomorrow. He said he wanted to hear all about it the next evening.\n[2002-04-03 11:00:00] Nittogate Cafe | I arrived an hour earlier than the scheduled time and sat down to start writing my review of Helen Stersen's new manuscript. I realized I no longer had any desire toward her; the feeling was more like a faint tremor caused by anticipating something unknown.\n[2002-04-03 12:00:00] Nittogate Cafe | I saw her hop off her bicycle, lock it up, and then push open the door to come inside. I watched as she spotted me and walked straight over. I felt that the café was almost full. I noticed she glanced at the window before stepping in.\n[2002-04-03 12:00:10] Nittogate Cafe | I heard her greet me with a 'hi,' and I replied the same. She said she was going to order something and asked if I wanted anything, but I politely declined.\n[2002-04-03 12:01:00] Nittogate Cafe | I saw her place her hands on the counter and lean forward toward the barista behind the coffee machine. I sat there and lit a cigarette. The hissing sound of the coffee machine filled my ears. I noticed she had filled out since before—the boyish thinness was gone. Suddenly, I felt hollow inside.\n[2002-04-03 12:05:00] Nittogate Cafe | I watched her return with a cup of tea, sit down, and take out the tea strainer. I heard her say 'hi' again, and I returned the greeting. I remembered how her gray-green eyes could suddenly widen for no reason. I stared at the way she brought the teacup to her lips and blew on it.\n[2002-04-03 12:10:00] Nittogate Cafe | I said to her, 'Long time no see—how have you been?' I heard her tell me she'd just come back from Brazil and Visby. She asked if I really intended to settle in Halvik, and I told her at least for a while. We also mentioned that we were both 'trying our hand at writing.'\n[2002-04-03 12:15:00] Nittogate Cafe | I heard her laugh and say we should do something together sometime. She asked who else I knew here, and I told her no one besides Karl Larsdal. I also asked her about Mirja’s recent situation.\n[2002-04-03 12:20:00] Nittogate Cafe | I said to her, 'Your short story in The Wanderer was fantastic—the linguistic power was incredible.' I heard her thank me quietly, looking down. I realized there were too many topics between us that we couldn't touch. This silence forced me to find something to talk about. I felt my praise hadn't come out quite clearly.\n[2002-04-03 12:25:00] Nittogate Cafe | I lit another cigarette and sat watching her. I heard her say she was now working on essays. I told her I hadn’t finished a novel in four years and had scrapped my old draft before leaving. I heard myself say, 'It’s so good to see you again.' She said the same back. A long silence settled around us.\n[2002-04-03 12:30:00] Nittogate Cafe | I nodded toward the stack of papers lying on the sofa. I said to her, 'I was reading Helen Stersen’s manuscript before you came—do you know her?' I heard her say yes, and mention Helen Stersen’s visit to Biskops-Årnä. I responded that it was strange—a Leivik girl writing about that place. I mentally scolded myself—what was I even doing, babbling on like this?\n[2002-04-03 12:35:00] Nitotter Café | I heard Nils Nils laugh and say she didn't read much. She mentioned the two Leivik boys from 'The Wanderer,' asking what they were called. I told her they were Hilda and Anna, and said they were good friends I was currently at odds with. I was surprised that the 'boys' she referred to were actually my female friends.\n[2002-04-03 12:40:00] Nitotter Café | I saw her stand up and go to the bathroom. I heard her say Bjorn Jens had been talking about my book with them before, so they had a certain impression of me. Another awkward silence settled in.\n[2002-04-03 12:45:00] Nitotter Café | I heard the coffee machine hiss and occasionally crackle; I saw a long, restless line of people waiting at the counter. Outside the window, the view was gray and dull, the grass in the park yellowish and wet. I inwardly sighed—this was hopeless. I had no idea what nonsense I’d just said. I even began to wonder what people were really talking about at all.\n[2002-04-03 12:50:00] Nitotter Café | I saw her walk back and sit down, and then we exchanged a smile. I heard her ask about my daily routine and whether I knew the city well. I shook my head and said I hadn’t started getting familiar yet, but told her I was writing and swimming every day at Mælbløa Square. She said, 'Really? I swim there too. Not every day, but almost.'\n[2002-04-03 13:00:00] Nitotter Café | I took out my phone to check the time, put my manuscript and phone into my backpack, and stood up to leave. I heard myself say to her, 'I'm afraid I have to go now.' I heard her nod and say, 'But we can meet again, right?' I replied yes, definitely, and told her to call me anytime. I added finally, 'It was so good seeing you again!' Her voice lingered in my ear: 'Bye now.'\n[2002-04-03 13:10:00] Sørmarka Street / Rented Room | I walked down the street with my backpack, passed through the park, and returned to my rented apartment. I locked the door behind me, lay down on the water bed, and stared at the ceiling. I crossed the park and entered the wide street where my apartment was located. I realized nothing between us had changed—we were ultimately destined never to connect. I even blamed my own obesity. Closing my eyes, I tried to picture her face, thinking she had become someone entirely different.",

    "text": "[2002-04-03 13:15:00] Rented Room | I knew that in 1999 at Bischoffs-Arne, the most striking thing about her was a relentless, determined stubbornness. I realized that cold yet fragile quality had disappeared; she had become softer, shyer, and somewhat more open. I wondered in my mind—had she never shown this side before?\n[2002-04-03 14:00:00] Rented Room | I realized there were certain things we simply couldn't talk about—and if we couldn't talk about those, all other small talk was meaningless. I closed my eyes and tried hard to recall her appearance. Though I still felt some tenderness toward her, I was certain the desire had vanished.\n[2002-04-03 15:00:00] Mælbløa Square Swimming Hall | I got out of bed, put on my jacket, and walked to Mælbløa Square to enter the swimming hall. After changing, I stepped onto the diving board and plunged into the water, swimming a full kilometer. I kept repeating the motion—swimming forward, swimming back. I felt the pale March sunlight filtering through the high windows at the far end. I noticed the swimming hall was nearly empty, the only sound being the lapping of water. I forced myself not to think about anything, merely counting meters and time in my head, focusing solely on achieving perfect strokes.\n[2002-04-03 15:40:00] Swimming Hall Sauna | I entered the sauna and wiped sweat from my forehead with a towel. I looked down at the loose folds of fat around my stomach. I recalled having had various small or grand writing inspirations, yet realized I had always just been pretending. I mocked myself inwardly for this pale, fat, and foolish body.\n[2002-04-03 16:00:00] swimming pool shower room | I got up and walked to the shower, stood under the spray, closed my eyes, and washed my hair with shampoo. After rinsing off, I went to the locker, opened it, and got dressed. I realized that no one in Halvik knew me—I was completely free. I imagined life after Toniye, going to Buenos Aires or Moscow. I felt I no longer needed to write; freedom alone was enough.\n[2002-04-03 17:00:00] marketplace/rented room | I left the swimming pool with my towel and wet underwear, walked to the marketplace, and leaned against a counter eating a slipper bread. When I got home, I tried writing, then lay in bed watching an American soap opera until I fell asleep. I entered the gray and chilly daylight. I saw the market stalls and the glowing TV screen inside the apartment. I hoped Karl Larsdal would arrive earlier than our agreed time.\n[2002-04-03 20:00:00] rented room | When I woke up, I saw it was already dark. I heard knocking at the door and went to open it, seeing Karl Larsdal there, and we shook hands. I heard him ask, 'Well, how is it?' I replied, 'Fine. Where are we going?'\n[2002-04-03 20:05:00] rented room | I watched Karl Larsdal shrug his shoulders and walk around the room, looking at the decorations. I nodded. I heard Karl exclaim in front of the bookshelf, 'No matter where you go, you find the same books... isn't that strange?' He suggested going to Golden Monkey Restaurant, saying their chicken was good. I told him not to go to the mill, and finally agreed to go to Golden Monkey. I also found it strange how typical cultural-worker reading material looked on the bookshelf.\n[2002-04-03 20:15:00] Søndre Malm Street | We walked quickly down the street. I heard Karl keep pressing me as we moved forward, asking about the meeting details, asking how I felt when I saw Nils Nils. Irritated, I shot back how many times he planned to ask, saying I couldn’t sort out every emotional ripple. He joked whether I made my living from that, and I answered, 'No. I make my living by repeatedly making a fool of myself.' I felt the cold, damp air outside, the sky gray and heavy, as if snow might fall at any moment. I realized I didn’t want to delve deeply into those complex emotional feelings.\n[2002-04-03 20:30:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I pushed open the door of Golden Monkey Restaurant, passed through the front bar area, and entered the dining room at the back. We sat down, looked over the menu, and ordered chicken and beer from the waiter. I said to Karl, 'Here we are, we're going to eat—didn't you say so yourself?' I heard him reply, 'Why not?'\n[2002-04-03 20:40:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I said to Karl, 'Did I ever tell you I came here with Alve before?' I heard him answer simply, 'No.' I knew that in 1999, I had been to this restaurant with Alve.\n[2002-04-03 20:50:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I heard Karl ask me, 'So it just goes on like that?' I answered, 'It just goes on like that.'\n[2002-04-03 21:00:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I heard Karl say to me, 'Interesting! You swallow everything down. All the pain, emotions, and shame—you take it all in. You’re hurting yourself.' I was telling Karl the whole story from back then. I saw him staring down at the table until I finished, then he looked up and met my eyes.\nI heard Karl comment on my character, saying I was interesting, always swallowing down every pain, offense, and shame. He remarked, 'You hurt yourself, not others.' I watched Karl listen intently, head bowed, as I recounted that story. After I finished, he looked up and gazed at me, sharing his insight.\n[2002-04-03 21:05:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I said to Karl, \"Any teenage girl would do this.\" I heard him retort, \"No, they wouldn't! You cut your face into strips... I've never heard of anyone doing something like that.\"\nI argued to him that such self-harming behavior was common among teenage girls. I heard Karl shout back excitedly, insisting no one would ever cut their face up the way I did—he'd never heard of such an extreme act.\n[2002-04-03 21:10:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I shrugged my shoulders. I explained to him, \"The cuts weren't deep, it wasn't really that bad.\" I mentioned it was just the result of all kinds of pressures coming together—my father's death, media attention, life with Tonje, and of course Nils Nils. I felt that although the scene looked frightening at the time, for me it was simply an inevitable outburst caused by accumulated pressure from every direction.\nI made a helpless gesture toward him. I told him, \"It wasn't serious, the cuts weren't deep.\" I attributed it to my father's passing, the attention on my work, and the emotional conflicts in my life. I heard myself mention Nils Nils' name again. I realized in that moment I had used self-harm to release a tangle of complex emotions.\n[2002-04-03 21:15:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I waved to signal the waiter to bring the bill. I heard Karl ask if I felt anything for her anymore, and whether I still intended to meet her. I replied that I didn't have strong feelings, and meeting again would just be to have a friend here. When he said 'another friend,' I quickly agreed, 'Yes, yes, yes.'\nI raised my hand to call the waiter over. I heard him press me about my lingering feelings for Nils Nils. I insisted I didn't feel much anymore, and even if we met, it would only be to expand my circle of friends. In response to his teasing about 'another friend,' I merely nodded along absentmindedly.\n[2002-04-04 10:00:00] Rented Room | I received a phone call from a woman, then suggested going over to talk with her. I heard the woman who rented me the apartment say that a close friend wanted to sublet. I asked what subletting meant, and she explained dividing one room and sharing the rest of the space. I originally thought it might not be suitable, but when she mentioned the place was on Bastugata—the best street in Halviken—and that the person greatly admired Leivik's literature, I agreed to come talk. I know it was April 4, 2002.\nThe next day I received a call about a room available for subletting. I then arranged a time to meet with the person. I heard the woman on the phone strongly recommend the apartment on Bastugata. Although I had some reservations about sharing a place, upon hearing it was in a prime location and that the other person was a literature enthusiast, I decided to go check it out. The date is April 4, 2002.\n[2002-04-04 11:00:00] Bastugata Apartment | I wrote down the name, made the call, and then went to see the apartment. I walked into the room, saw a photo of a man on the wall, and then followed her to view the bathroom and kitchen. I heard her say I could come see it right away. After seeing the photo, I heard her say it was her late husband. I said to her, \"That's truly unfortunate.\" As she showed me around, she pointed at one room and said, \"This would be your room... if you want to write, just close this door.\" I responded that it felt nice. I know the apartment really is excellent.\nI dialed the number and went to view the apartment in person. I noticed the photo of the deceased man on the wall, then followed her as she moved through the apartment. I heard her describe the independent living space, including a private bathroom. In response to the photo of her late husband, I expressed my condolences. She told me that closing that door would allow me to write in peace, and I acknowledged that positively. I found the apartment's environment very elegant.\n[2002-04-04 14:00:00] Bastugata apartment | I made the decision on the spot. I walked out of the apartment, ready to move in that afternoon. I said to him, 'I'll take it.' I heard her ask when I could move in, and I replied, 'Right now.' I also told her I'd bring my things over that afternoon.\nI clearly stated that I wanted to rent the room. I began planning the timing of my move. I told the young woman I had decided to rent it. In response to her questions, I said I wanted to move in immediately. I heard myself promise to bring all my belongings over that afternoon.\n[2002-04-04 19:00:00] Karl Larsdal's home | I finished telling Karl Larsdal about my experience. I heard Karl Larsdal burst out laughing and say, 'It's impossible to just show up here, not know anyone, and get an apartment on Bastugata! Understand? The gods love you, Grete Lundnes—no doubt about it.' I also said to him, 'But Caesar doesn't like me.' He replied, 'No, that's not true—Caesar likes you too. He's just a little bit jealous, that's all.' As I listened to his teasing, I felt a wave of relief wash over me.\nI recounted to Karl Larsdal how I had rented the apartment on Bastugata. I heard Karl Larsdal laugh and exclaim, 'To come here knowing no one and land a place on Bastugata—it's simply impossible! The gods must favor you.' I responded, 'But Caesar doesn't like me.' He countered that Caesar actually liked me too, he was just slightly jealous. I could sense that Karl was truly amazed I’d found such a good place in such a short time.\n[2002-04-05 10:00:00] Sørmalen | I saw myself fully immersed in writing the story about crabs and seagulls, producing twenty or thirty pages. I noticed my running route growing longer each day, stretching almost across all of Sørmalen. I also saw my weight dropping steadily, pound by pound. I realized my conversations with Tonje were becoming fewer—my mind completely consumed by writing and exercise.",

    "text": "[2002-04-07 12:00:00] Hovin Street Arch Slope Café | I called Nils Nils to tell her I had moved, and asked if she'd like to have coffee. An hour later, I watched as we sat together in the café overlooking Hovin Street. I heard her say she wanted to meet. She asked if I had gone swimming today, and I laughed and said no. She told me she had swum at dawn, saying it felt especially good at that hour. I was situated atop the arch slope overlooking Hovin Street, surrounded by the café’s relaxed atmosphere. When she sat down, my first thought was that she seemed a bit happier than before.\nI called Nils Nils to invite her for coffee, and soon after, we met at the café on the Hovin Street arch slope. I told her I had moved. She asked about my swimming, and I smiled and said no. I heard her say that swimming at dawn was an amazing experience. From the café, I could see the view of Hovin Street. I noticed her mood seemed improved, and her smile appeared more frequent than before.\n[2002-04-07 12:30:00] Hovin Street Arch Slope Café | I sat in the café, stirring my cappuccino with a spoon, then lit a cigarette. I shook my head. I heard her ask, 'Do you like theater?' I told her that the National Theater performances I used to watch made me feel like I was staring at fish in an aquarium, unable to connect. I mentioned the actor in *Faust* at the festival who mumbled through his lines wearing a big black nose. She suggested seeing Bergman’s *Ghosts*, and I said, 'Alright, I can try that.' I sat there, momentarily unable to think of anything to say. I inwardly sighed, thinking this was probably our last meeting.\nWe sat at the table, I smoked and stirred my coffee. I expressed my lack of interest in traditional theater by shaking my head. She asked me about theater. I described to her the sense of detachment I used to feel when watching plays, mentioning the actor with the large nose. I heard her suggest seeing Bergman’s *Ghosts*, and I agreed I could give it a try. I concluded in my heart that this would be our final meeting, and found myself oddly speechless in her presence.\n[2002-04-07 12:45:00] Hovin Street Arch Slope Café | We stayed a little longer for fifteen minutes. Finally, I tucked my cigarette into my pocket and stood up. She asked, 'So we’re set then?' I replied, 'Yes, sounds interesting.' She suggested bringing my Leivik friend along, and I agreed. When she proposed meeting here tomorrow at half past eleven to buy tickets, I readily said, 'Sure, no problem.' I felt a long silence between us, and thought perhaps she, like me, was eager to leave.\nI stood up to leave, putting away my cigarettes as I did. I heard her ask if the plan was settled, and I nodded yes. She asked me to bring that Leivik friend so she could meet him. We agreed to meet again at the same place tomorrow at eleven thirty to buy tickets. In a stretch of silence, I felt that we both were eager to end this meeting.\n[2002-04-08 11:30:00] Harvik Street | I walked twenty minutes with Nils Nils. I had her go book the tickets, then I walked back alone. I saw the whole city bathed in sunlight, the trees just beginning to bud. Before me was a street full of cheerful people, a beautiful spring scene. I learned that it takes twenty minutes to walk from Arch Hill to the Royal Theatre. I felt that we hardly spoke at all along the way. I realized this state of 'saying nothing' would probably continue on indefinitely.\nI walked side by side with her toward the Royal Theatre; after booking the tickets, I took my leave and went home. The streets ahead were filled with sunlight, green buds just emerging. I sensed the springtime joy radiating from the people around me. I noticed we remained silent the entire way. I knew clearly in my heart that we probably had nothing more to say to each other.\n[2002-04-08 11:50:00] King's Garden | I crossed through King's Garden. I saw her squinting at me as I told a story. She said, 'A few weeks ago, I saw something strange on TV... a shelf started smoking and caught fire, but when customers saw it, they just calmly took their change and walked away, with flames burning behind them!' I moved forward under the bright, low-angled sunlight. I understood she was referring to footage from a convenience store security camera.\nI was walking through King's Garden. She described to me the strange incident she'd seen on TV: when the convenience store caught fire, customers calmly checked out and left, completely ignoring the flames behind them. The sunlight slanted across my face, intensely bright.\n[2002-04-08 11:55:00] King's Garden | I looked at her, saw her glance back at me, and then we both laughed. She continued the story: 'Another customer came in, stared straight at the flames, finished checking out, picked up his things, and walked out. Do you understand?' I answered, 'I do.' I told her I didn't think it was about minding one’s business, but rather that people saw the fire yet refused to believe their eyes—they preferred to trust their minds.\nI listened to her continue the story, watching her smiling face. I heard her say the second customer also remained indifferent to the flames. I responded, 'I get it.' I explained my view to her: the customer chose to trust the logic in his mind over the real scene he witnessed with his own eyes.\n[2002-04-08 12:00:00] Palace Island Bridgehead | We reached the bridgehead. I made my way through crowds of tourists, noticing some immigrant fishermen along the roadside. I asked, 'What happened then?' She told me a third person finally came in shouting to alert others about the fire, but by then the store was already completely destroyed. I nodded and said, 'Yes.' On the other side of the bridge lay the island where the Palace stands. The surroundings were noisy and crowded.\nI arrived at the Palace Island bridgehead, squeezing through throngs of tourists. I noticed those fishermen by the roadside. I asked her how the story ended. She said it wasn't until the third person showed up that someone shouted about the fire—but by then, it was too late to save anything. I affirmed what she said. I was in the bustling entrance area of Palace Island.\n[2002-04-10 10:00:00] Harvik | I saw the first ray of sunlight appear, and everything around became clear, bright, and lively. I realized that after meeting Nils Nils, the sun had risen in my life. I felt an unprecedented happiness—sunlight now hung high in the sky of my existence, shining down continuously.\n[2002-04-10 10:00:00] Bastu Street apartment | After I got home, I took out the poetry collection again. I had shown her photo to Henrik Inge. I learned she was from Mochengdao, but that was all I knew about her. I knew she had published a poetry collection in Bisshops-Alne. I began repeatedly thinking about the stories she told. I stared at the image in the poetry book of the narrator entwined with a man, looking into a mirror. As I read poems about whales and enormous creatures, I wondered in my heart: was that really her?\nAfter I got home, I opened her poetry collection and recalled the moment when I showed her photograph. I knew I didn't truly understand this woman from Mochengdao. I had only fragmented memories of the content of her poetry collection. I remembered the illustrations in the book, pondering the sharp yet fragile emotions within, trying to glimpse the real her through these words.\n[2002-04-12 19:00:00] Royal Theatre | Nils Nils, Karl, and I went to the theatre. During intermission, we went up to the balcony overlooking the harbor and sat down at a table. I heard Karl and Nils Nils complaining about how terrible the performance was. I expressed a relatively more positive opinion. The balcony offered a wide view, with the harbor scenery fully visible. I knew this was the play we were going to see in a few days. I felt the grand atmosphere of the theatre stirred a sense of anticipation in me. Though this scene felt confined, I believed the fusion of Bergman and Ibsen would eventually create something meaningful.\nDuring the theatre's intermission, we went up to the balcony. I looked at the harbor view while listening to their conversation. I heard their criticisms of the performance. Not fully agreeing, I voiced my own expectations for the play. The nighttime harbor, paired with the theatre’s ornate decor, felt stylish and refined. I realized this sense of constraint might be the prelude to some climax. Deep down, I felt something was about to emerge and transform our entire perception.\n[2002-04-12 21:00:00] Royal Theatre | I saw a huge red sun glowing behind the stage, and watched Osvald roll naked across the stage. I noticed how details vanished on the stage that awakened them. I felt everything in the performance being elevated, with tension continuously intensifying. I experienced fire-like heat and ice-like cold simultaneously. I felt transported beyond myself; reality no longer mattered. I realized this raw emotional exposure allowed me to confront the essence of existence directly. I thought, only someone deeply cultivated could possess such skill and intuition.\nI sat in the audience, watching the stage—the sun-like backdrop and the actors’ physical struggles. I found myself no longer certain of the details I saw. This wild, reckless artistic atmosphere made me feel a suffocating tension. I felt as if standing at the very core of life. I realized this kind of courage could only come from a master who had created an immense body of work. This way of touching the essence deeply moved me.\n[2002-04-12 22:00:00] Artists' Bar | We followed the crowd out of the theatre, walked onto the streets, and finally decided to go to the Artists' Bar for beer. I sat there listening to their conversation. I heard Nils Nils imitate Max von Sydow’s dialogue with Death, telling the story of how she once angered Bergman during rehearsal. We discussed the differences between 'Ghosts' and 'Peer Gynt.' Karl talked about the Bergman film screenings he’d seen at the cinema. Walking on the street, the surrounding atmosphere was dazed yet intoxicated, like that of dreamy passengers. I recalled those awkward moments from three years ago and realized the discomfort I once felt had now disappeared. Seeing their enraptured expressions, I genuinely felt happy about having moved to Halvik and having them by my side.\nI merged into the crowd leaving the theatre, then strolled with them through the streets and into a bar. I quietly listened to their discussion. Nils Nils enthusiastically talked about Bergman, even doing an imitation on the spot. Karl joined in, discussing Bergman’s old films. I heard them analyze the surface and depth of the two plays. The night air on Halvik’s streets was cool and pleasant. The bar buzzed with lively, cheerful energy. I realized that complicated past experience no longer troubled me. Looking at the woman beside me, I felt the earlier unease had completely faded. I felt content with this moment of peace and companionship.\n[2002-04-12 23:30:00] Rented room on Maria Mountain | After we parted ways, I walked uphill and returned to my rented room on Maria Mountain. The road up Maria Mountain was steep and quiet. Suddenly, I became aware of two things: I wanted to see her again as soon as possible, and I must reach that place at the very core of human existence. I swore to myself that even if it took forty years, I would never forget the direction leading there.\nI walked alone up the hill and returned to my place. The night on Maria Mountain exuded a serene stillness. I realized my intense longing for her. More importantly, I strengthened my resolve to explore the essence of existence through creation. That 'core' was where I had to go—and I would always remember the clarity of that moment.\n[2002-04-14 10:00:00] Bastugata apartment | I heard Nils Nils invite me on the phone: \"Come to the Walpurgis Night party—it's me and my two girlfriends hosting. Feel free to bring your friend Karl.\" I learned this happened two days after seeing the play.\nI received her call. She invited me to the upcoming party. She told me she was throwing a party and specifically mentioned I should bring Karl. It was April 14, 2002.\n[2002-04-30 20:00:00] Southmalm apartment | I walked through Southmalm to the party, and soon settled into a sofa with a glass of punch in hand. I saw a group of young Halvikers around me—jazz musicians, theater people, writers, jugglers, and fire-eaters. I knew Nils Nils, Siv Ingrid, and Ødegård were the organizers of the party; they had met while working at the theater. I was surrounded by people from the cultural scene, soaking in the lively atmosphere of the party.\nI entered the party apartment with Karl; we each sat on the sofa holding a glass of punch. The room was packed with actors from the Royal Theater and Circus Syk, filled with fire-eaters and aerialists. I learned the party coincided with the run of the joint production of *Romeo and Juliet*. Looking around, I realized everyone here was connected to Halvik’s cultural life.\n[2002-04-30 21:00:00] Party apartment | I dragged myself from one group to another, and after a few gin drinks, tried to chat with two actors. I heard the two actors scoffing at Bergman; one said, \"That old fool! So damn traditional—makes me wanna puke just watching him.\" I realized it would be impossible to get through the night without saying a word. Praising Bergman felt outdated and foolish in the eyes of these avant-garde actors.\nI moved through the crowd, exchanging polite words, then approached a few theater people and enthusiastically praised Bergman. I heard actors dismiss Bergman, calling his work stale and nauseating. I knew these young actors longed for a new kind of theater—circus-style, with torches and stilts. I regretted my foolishness. Here I was, a disheartened Leivik man, praising Bergman like he was something fresh and radical, in front of youth who had already pushed tradition as far as possible.\n[2002-04-30 22:00:00] Party apartment | I saw Nils Nils and Karl Larsdal still excitedly chatting on the sofa. I walked away and found a cluster of jazz fans, nodding vaguely among them. I was asked about my knowledge of Leivik jazz, and I remembered Bugge Wesseltoft’s name and mentioned him. I noticed their smiles—suddenly, it felt like a small knife twisting in my heart. I feared she might fall for my friend again.\nI watched Nils Nils and Karl on the sofa, then avoided them and sat down on a chair on the other side. When asked about Leivik jazz musicians, I heard myself utter a few barely recalled names. I felt a surge of jealousy and unease. Only when the jazz fans nodded in approval of my answers did I feel relieved.\n[2002-04-30 22:30:00] Party apartment | I saw a black-haired woman in a floral dress approaching me. I watched her squeeze through the crowd toward the kitchen. I heard her ask, \"Are you the writer from Leivik?\" She also asked my opinion on Jan Sjåstad and others. She told me, \"Stay right here—I’ll go get my husband.\" I struggled with her name in my mind—Hilda? Vilda? Finally, I realized it must be Ilda.\nA woman with a broad face and wide mouth approached me. I watched her deliver her message and then turn into the kitchen. I heard her asking my thoughts on several Leivik writers. I heard myself give affirmative answers. I was annoyed that I couldn’t remember her name, puzzling over it uselessly for minutes.\n[2002-04-30 22:40:00] party apartment | I saw her dragging a man back with her. A while later, I got up and excused myself to go to the kitchen in search of food. I heard Ilda say to her husband, 'Now you can repeat what you said before!' Then I awkwardly exchanged a few words with the man until the conversation died out. I could tell at a glance that the man was a scholar—his face had 'university' written all over it. I felt this conversation was completely pointless.\nI watched Ilda pull her husband toward me. When the conversation stalled, I turned and walked away to the kitchen. I heard her urging her husband to repeat his earlier point. I also heard myself mechanically responding to him. I realized there was nothing worth discussing with this typical academic type—I just wanted to get away quickly and find something to eat.",

    "text": "[2002-04-30 23:00:00] sofa in the party apartment | I sat down on the sofa to eat a chicken leg and happened to make eye contact with a dark-haired woman. I struggled to sit upright on the soft, low couch and tried to swallow the chicken in my mouth. I heard her ask, 'Who are you?' I replied that I was Grete Lundnes from Leivik. She told me she was Mei Nils Nils, the actress playing Juliet. I learned she was currently with Romeo. I felt like a dwarf sitting there. I worried that grease from the chicken was glistening on my cheeks.\nI sat on the sofa gnawing chicken off a paper plate as the dark-haired woman approached me. I gave her my name. I heard her voice asking a question. I heard her say she was the lead actress in 'Romeo and Juliet.' I exclaimed, 'Oh, right!' I felt the sofa was too soft, making me unsteady. I still carried within me the lingering joy from watching Bergman's play.\n[2002-04-30 23:10:00] sofa in the party apartment | I saw a sturdy man come over and kiss her on both cheeks. I nodded and smiled at him. I watched them walk away and raised the chicken leg again. I heard the man ask her, 'Have you eaten yet?' She replied, 'No.' I felt this damn lousy sofa made me look like a dwarf. I realized there was nothing left to do but drink.\nI watched the man affectionately kiss her and nod politely in my direction. As they walked away, I continued eating. I heard their brief exchange before they both left. I felt left out, stuck in this awkward position, sensing a touch of helplessness.\n[2002-05-01 02:00:00] party apartment / Bastugata apartment | After looking through a physician’s photo album, I left the party and walked back to my room on Bastugata. I felt the alcohol had only plunged me deeper into a mental abyss. I realized nothing would come of me and Nils Nils—we’d barely spoken all night. I was glad I hadn’t stayed until the end waiting for some miracle to happen.\nBefore leaving, I flipped through a photo album for a while. At two in the morning, I walked home alone. I recalled how little I'd said at the party and thought no woman would find me interesting. I was filled with frustration, feeling this relationship had already reached its end.\n[2002-05-01 20:00:00] Bastugata apartment | The next evening I stood by the window making a phone call. I pressed the phone to my ear, gazing at Halvik unfolding in the glow of the setting sun. I heard myself thanking her. She said she hoped I'd enjoyed myself. I asked what she was doing, and she answered, 'Watching TV, ice hockey.' The entire city was bathed in a wide expanse of red twilight. I sensed a moment of great significance approaching. I had intended to end the call, but after a silence, I decided to keep talking—and arranged to meet again.\nI leaned against the window in the Bastugata apartment and dialed her number. I looked out at the distant sunset and listened to her voice on the other end. I heard her say the party had been nice. When I heard her mention watching ice hockey, I repeated in surprise, 'Ice hockey?' I realized I was correcting last night’s poor performance. We wrestled in silence, and finally I broke through—it made me feel that everything might still turn around.\n[2002-05-05 14:00:00] Halvik | We met and exchanged polite greetings. I heard her ask about my family and experiences. When asked about marriage, I heard myself say, 'Yes, in a way, I'm still married.' I caught a soft 'Oh' from her in response. I learned that except for six months in Florence, she had stayed mostly in Halvik; whereas I had lived in many countries and cities. I felt we were both too overwhelmed to speak freely—stuck, unable to say anything real, reduced to exchanging background facts.\nI sat across from her, trading pieces of our pasts. I listened as she spoke about her mother and brother. I also confessed to her my current marital situation. I realized that despite having so much to say inside, at this moment I was like a mute man, limited to formulaic small talk and brief introductions.\n[2002-05-10 19:00:00] Golden Monkey Restaurant | I saw her appear at the Golden Monkey Restaurant. We spent the whole evening drinking and wandering outside. In the end, I gave her a quick hug outside the gate before going into the apartment. I heard her say joyfully, 'I got accepted into the drama school today—so happy, it's amazing. Then suddenly I wanted to see you.' The Golden Monkey Restaurant buzzed with lively energy after nightfall. It was mid-April. Seeing her happiness, I found myself smiling too. I sensed something certain in this meeting—a quiet clarity.\nHalf an hour after receiving her call, I saw her arrive at the place where we'd been drinking. I stayed with her until late into the night, and hugged her when we parted. She shared her good news, bubbling with excitement over being accepted into drama school. I heard her say she came because she suddenly wanted to see me. I saw the sparkle in her eyes. Though slightly drunk, I clearly felt our connection drawing closer.\n[2002-05-11 10:00:00] Bastugatan Apartment | I heard Karl say to me on the phone, 'She’s fallen for you, man. It’s written all over her face.' I argued it was just the admission excitement, but he asked, 'If that’s all it was, then why did she call you?' Though I denied it aloud, his words stirred up confusion inside me. I wasn’t sure whether she truly felt about me as he claimed.\nI heard Karl’s confident voice insisting that Nils Nils was completely gone. I also heard my own weak defense. He suggested calling her directly to find out, and I agreed. I marveled at how sharp Karl’s intuition always was, while I habitually hid behind layers of uncertainty and doubt.\n[2002-05-12 20:00:00] People's Opera House | I went with her to see a movie, then we silently entered the People's Opera House and sat down without a word. I learned that the new film we chose was *Star Wars*. I felt deeply frustrated leaving home, full of irritation. I thought choosing this film was a stupid decision, and the suffocating feeling left me unable to speak.\nI stared at the big screen, not really watching the film at all. Then I followed her into the opera house, sitting there in silence. I realized I couldn't confide my inner heaviness to anyone. This forced immersion in a 'kids’ movie' dragged my mood down to rock bottom.\n[2002-05-13 05:00:00] Bastugatan Apartment / Rooftop Terrace | I got up at five, smoked and drank coffee on the rooftop terrace. I wrote until noon, then ran ten kilometers around Södermalm or swam a thousand meters. Afterward, I wandered into town at leisure. From the terrace, I could see all of Halvik. The March air was fresh, and greenery was just beginning to emerge. I realized I had already lost ten kilograms and resumed writing again. I felt I was doing well. Though things had been awkward with her, this solitude and discipline made me feel it was all behind me.\nI kept up my habit of rising early. I noticed my body felt much lighter. I moved through the city either running or lingering in cafés. Morning sunlight spilled across the terrace. The canal’s clear water shimmered alongside the beautiful buildings. I felt life was back under my control. The smooth flow of writing and the satisfying fatigue after exercise brought me a grounded kind of joy.\n[2002-05-13 20:30:00] Bastugata Apartment | I read the novel Karl recommended, bathed in the glow of the setting sun. I woke up still feeling happy. Around eight thirty, the sun was going down, staining the wall across from my bed a deep blood-red. Suddenly, a wild, dizzying happiness surged through my entire body. I realized I was free—completely free—and that life could be this wonderful. I hadn't felt anything like this since childhood.\nI lay reading in the crimson afterglow of sunset, immersed in the world of literature. The sunlight outside the window was fading bit by bit, and a quiet stillness filled the room. I was struck by that sudden joy. I marveled that such causeless happiness could last so long. I thought that even if this feeling were only temporary, it would still be enough to prove how beautiful life can be.\n[2002-05-14 14:00:00] South Malmo / Park | I sat on the rooftop terrace writing, not knowing whether what I wrote was good or bad, but in excellent spirits. At noon, I put on my running shoes and ran ten kilometers around South Malmo, feeling as light as a feather. When I got home, I took a shower, had some soup and flaky pastry bread, then went to the park to read and called some family and friends. Waking at midnight, I saw the leftover fruit peels by my bed and realized I had gotten up in the night to eat plums and apples. I saw pale daylight falling on the terrace, surrounded by lush, vivid greenery. I noticed the emerald water in the canal and the beautiful buildings along the roadside. I felt there was something even more beautiful in the world than writing novels. I realized that while running, my mind had begun to appreciate the scenery around me.\nI sat on the terrace, writing in the sunlight. I run or swim every day, and my weight is decreasing. After exercising, I take a shower, eat something simple, and go to the park to read. I also called friends and family like Olaf Ingva, Henrik Inge, and Tonje. I noticed the green water in the canal and the lush greenery, sunlight falling on one beautiful building after another. I saw the plum and apple peels scattered beside my bed. I felt immeasurable joy, realizing there was something more exciting in life than literature. I discovered that exercise had made me feel lighter, a happiness that even carried into my dreams, making me unconsciously eat in the middle of the night.\n[2002-05-15 10:00:00] Biskops-Arnö | In early May, I traveled to Biskops-Arnö to prepare for a lecture. Outside the main building, I met Lemhagen. I heard Lemhagen say to me that he had never seen anyone go through something like what I experienced at the Newcomer workshop. I knew I had agreed half a year earlier to give a lecture there. I understood the atmosphere at the time had been particularly intense, and the impact wasn't limited to me alone. I understood what he meant.\nI was invited to Biskops-Arnö and met Lemhagen on campus. Lemhagen's voice came to my ears as he admitted he had never encountered such an extraordinary situation in his teaching career as the one I had previously faced. I knew it was early May. Although I had considered declining the lecture, he insisted I come and listen to the discussions. I realized he understood the unique atmosphere I had been in at the time.\n[2002-05-15 20:00:00] Little Yang Forest | Every evening I went running in Little Yang Forest. Often, I couldn’t make it a hundred meters before my heart pounded and I struggled to breathe, my legs trembling uncontrollably. In the end, I had to walk back to the apartment and drink some soup with dry bread. I knew those days weren't really enjoyable, but I understood that I needed exercise to regain my strength.",

    "text": "[2002-05-15 20:00:00] Biskops-Arnö | I attended course discussions at Biskops-Arnö. In the evening, we drank with writer Sandlund from Leivik. I retold an embarrassing story from Ariel Rein’s book about dealing with excrement. I heard two older Icelandic writers make insightful but highly controversial remarks. I heard Sandlund tell a story about how people in the wild can identify traces by smell just like animals. I found the lectures and discussions boring, perhaps because I was in such a good mood that I couldn’t concentrate. I saw how everyone burst into laughter when Sandlund told his stories.\nI sat in class listening to dull discussions. At night, I gathered with Sandlund and other writers to drink, sharing a comical scene I had read in a book. I heard Sandlund entertain everyone with wilderness anecdotes, saying that human feces develop a distinctive odor after a few days. I heard the Icelandic writers’ comments spark heated arguments. I realized I had no interest in these courses. I watched as everyone, under the influence of alcohol, laughed uncontrollably at those absurd stories.\n[2002-05-16 18:00:00] Konsum Store | I saw a woman near the meat counter at the Konsum store. She walked past me with her basket and picked up a bag of salami. I saw her again at the checkout, and then she walked out the door. I saw she had auburn hair and a pale face dotted with freckles. I caught a faint scent from her—a mix of sweat and soap. I felt a pure physical attraction. For a moment, my heart raced, my throat tightened, and my insides swelled with a desire so intense it felt like it might explode. I think that sensation left me frozen in place for a long time, and I never saw her again after she disappeared.\n[2002-05-16 20:00:00] Mill Bar | I welcomed the visiting Jeppe and Lars, and took them back to Halvik for drinks. I texted Nils Nils to come over. We got heavily drunk at the Mill and the nightclub, and in the end, I watched Nils Nils go home alone. I heard myself discussing the topic of abortion with Nils Nils at the table. I heard Jeppe displaying remarkably intelligent conversation during the meal. I saw Nils Nils give me a hug. I sensed that Jeppe’s extraordinary charm and masculine presence deeply attracted Nils Nils, which instantly brought my mood down. I realized I had chosen an extremely inappropriate topic—abortion—to discuss while drunk.\nI met up with two old Baywick friends at the Mill Bar, and Nils Nils arrived as agreed. We drank and chatted, then moved on to a nightclub late into the night. In the end, I noticed Nils Nils left alone. I heard myself arguing with her about the serious topic of abortion. Jeppe’s captivating voice echoed in my ears. I felt a sense of crisis because of Jeppe’s presence; I noticed Nils Nils was not indifferent toward him. I think I deliberately brought up that awkward topic perhaps due to a sudden feeling of defeat inside.\n[2002-05-17 04:00:00] Bastugatan Apartment | I brought my friends back to my place. After Lars fell asleep, I sat talking with Jeppe. I watched tears slide down Jeppe’s cheeks. I heard Jeppe tell me about his late father, whom he called a completely good man. I saw the first soft rays of morning light streaming into the room, illuminating Jeppe’s head resting against the wall. I realized this moment would stay with me forever. I was deeply touched by Jeppe’s unexpected trust in showing such vulnerability at dawn.\nIn my Bastugatan apartment, I stayed awake with Jeppe until morning. Lars slept nearby while Jeppe shared stories from his past. I saw him crying in the morning light. I heard him speak about his father’s death, his voice filled with deep emotion. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting light on Jeppe’s sorrowful face. I felt this was an immense act of trust. Watching him in the play of light and shadow, I marveled at how sincere and raw this sudden emotional outpouring truly was.\n[2002-05-17 10:00:00] Café/Bastugatan Apartment | We went to a café for breakfast. After seeing them off to the airport, I returned home and collapsed into bed. When I woke up, I found my computer by the window soaked in water. I saw that the window I’d left open the previous night had let in rain, leaving the computer wet on the surface. I learned there were no backups on the computer.\nAfter saying goodbye to my friends at the café, I went home to catch up on sleep. When I woke again, I discovered my computer had been damaged by rainwater. I noticed that the wide-open window had allowed rain to pour in and ruin the computer. I realized I hadn’t backed up any of the files on my computer, and couldn’t help feeling annoyed.\n[2002-05-18 12:00:00] Bastugatan Apartment | I turned on the computer again and found it still worked. I received a call from Karl Larsdal. Then I called Nils Nils. I heard Karl suggest we four should go out for a meal to celebrate Leivik National Day. I also heard him warn me: 'There are few topics you should never discuss with women—abortion is one of them.' I heard Nils Nils say on the phone that she’d be happy to come over for dinner. I knew today was May 17th. I felt relieved the computer wasn’t broken. I had been afraid yesterday’s argument might make her unwilling to talk to me, so I admitted to Karl that I didn’t dare call.\nI tried turning on the water-damaged computer and found all issues had disappeared. I discussed holiday dinner plans with Karl over the phone. Then I mustered the courage to dial Nils Nils’ number. Karl scolded me on the phone, saying I shouldn’t bring up easily offensive topics like abortion with women. I heard Nils Nils readily accept my dinner invitation. I learned today was Leivik National Day. I felt a huge relief. I realized Karl was right—don’t cut off contact based on unfounded suspicion. I noticed she didn’t seem to hold yesterday’s dispute against me at all.\n[2002-05-18 12:05:00] Bastugatan Apartment | I followed the advice and made the call. I told Karl, 'I can’t bring myself to call her like this.' I heard him reply, 'What’s the worst that could happen?' He encouraged me, saying even rejection was better than staying here lost in thoughts. In the end, I heard Nils Nils agree to meet. I gathered the courage to face possible rejection, and the result turned out surprisingly smooth.\nI stood in the Bastugatan apartment and completed this phone call. I confessed my mental block to Karl, but he told me I’d never know the outcome unless I tried. I heard a clear yes from the other end of the line. I realized I always tend to overthink things. The moment she agreed to come, I felt the weight on my heart lift.\n[2002-05-18 14:00:00] Kleppeli Restaurant | We went to the Kleppeli Restaurant. I saw Nils Nils keep staring at me. I heard Karl Larsdal talking endlessly about the relationship between Leivik and Mochengdao. When we were alone, I apologized to her, and I heard her generously say, 'There's no need to apologize. You have your own opinions. It's not a big deal.' I noticed she didn't seem offended by yesterday's topic about miscarriage. I wondered in my mind what exactly she felt for Jeppe, but in the end, I decided to stay silent.\nWhile having a meal at the Kleppeli Restaurant, I observed the look in Nils Nils's eyes. After dinner, I took the chance to apologize to her. In my ear was Karl’s grand discourse on the relations between two countries. I heard Nils Nils gently respond to my apology, saying she understood that everyone had their own views. I sensed something meaningful in her gaze toward me. Though I still had Jeppe on my mind, I felt this atmosphere wasn’t right for bringing it up.\nWe took our seats at the People's Opera House—she brought me here. I closely observed every subtle movement of hers. I heard her enthusiastically recommend Chekhov’s works to me. Before closing time, the Russian national anthem echoed through the theater. I saw her captivating lip shape and her gray-green eyes as she spoke. I know she likes this place, and everything about Russia. I realized I was completely drawn to her. Watching her glow with excitement when talking about culture, I felt an intoxicating enchantment I couldn’t escape.\n[2002-05-18 21:00:00] People's Opera House | I heard her recommend the film 'Burnt by the Sun' and suggest we watch it together sometime. She also told me there would be a reading event at the mill in five days, where she would read her translation of Henrik Hagendal’s work, and asked if I wanted to come. I answered, 'Of course.' I heard her burst into laughter, realizing she still had so much she wanted to show me. I also found myself wondering whether I truly liked Hagendal’s work.\nShe told me her favorite movie was 'Burnt by the Sun,' vividly describing the Pioneer girl in it. I heard her invite me to her upcoming reading of her translated work. I immediately said I’d come support her. I discovered her side as a translator, which felt new and intriguing. I realized we now had more opportunities for interaction.\n[2002-05-18 21:10:00] People's Opera House | I heard her say she had translated 'The Siamese' and mentioned she worked on it with Ilda. She admitted feeling a bit nervous because Hagendal himself would be there. I also heard myself tell her I really loved 'The Siamese.' Finally, I heard her invite me to meet again tomorrow. I noticed she lacked confidence in her Leivik language skills, even though the original author had already approved the translation. I observed that when she mentioned Ilda, she was checking whether I remembered.\nShe revealed that the work she translated was indeed 'The Siamese,' and mentioned Hagendal himself would attend. I heard her complain that her Leivik wasn't good enough. I told her I greatly admired that piece. Then she invited me to meet tomorrow, and I agreed at once. I realized how much effort she had put into this translation. I also felt pleased that we would see each other again tomorrow.\n[2002-05-18 23:00:00] Outside the People's Opera House | After hearing the melody, I saw Nils Nils get up and put on her jacket. We walked outside the theater together. I watched her stop walking. I heard her ask, 'Same place then? Eight o'clock?' I said yes. Then I heard her offer to walk me home, and I happily agreed. The first stanza of the Russian national anthem echoed in my ears. I realized her home was actually in the opposite direction, yet she was willing to walk me home—this warmed my heart.\nI followed her out through the theater’s main entrance. I stood still in the night, watching her turn toward me. We set the time and place for meeting tomorrow. I heard her softly ask if she could walk me home. I nodded in agreement. The background sound was the solemn Russian national anthem. I knew she should take Hønsgata to get home, yet she now chose the opposite direction. I noticed her subtle thoughtfulness and her desire to spend more time together.\n[2002-05-18 23:15:00] Mary Mountain Junction | We walked in silence to a crossroads leading to Mary Mountain. I said to her, \"I'm very happy with you, but I can't say anything. It's as if you've turned me into a mute.\" I heard her glance quickly at me and reply, \"I noticed. It doesn't matter.\" I found this state strange. I mocked myself inwardly—what could she possibly do with a man like me, so tongue-tied?\nWe walked without speaking until I broke the silence at the intersection. I confessed to her that although I felt joy in her presence, I was always speechless. She told me she actually didn't mind my silence. On the quiet street, only our two figures moved. I thought perhaps my awkwardness wasn't a flaw in her eyes. This shared comfort in silence gave me an unprecedented sense of peace.\n[2002-05-18 23:30:00] Bastu Street Apartment Building | I watched her gently stroke my upper arm. We reached the apartment building and stopped by the roadside, gazing at each other. I stepped forward and hugged her. I heard her say, \"A beautiful evening.\" I replied, \"It's a bit strange—today is Leivik National Day... why isn't anyone celebrating?\" I said to her, \"See you tomorrow.\" She answered, \"Yes, good night.\" Silence fell again, and I heard our footsteps on the pavement amplified by the brick buildings on both sides. I wondered in my heart whether her stroking my arm meant she was telling me it would be all right even if I said something foolish.\nI watched her gently stroke my upper arm.

I wondered in my heart whether her stroking my arm meant she was telling me it would be all right even if I said something foolish.\n[2002-05-18 23:35:00] Bastu Street Apartment Entrance | I walked through the gate, then immediately turned back out. I saw her walking down the hill alone. I wanted one more look at her. I realized I had fallen in love with her, and inwardly wondered why that feeling hurt so much.\nI walked through the gate, then immediately turned back out. I saw her walking down the hill alone. I wanted one more look at her. I realized I had fallen in love with her, and inwardly wondered why that feeling hurt so much.\n[2002-05-19 10:00:00] Café Lasse in the Garden | I continued writing and running as usual. I sat outdoors at Café Lasse in the Garden reading, with Long Island across the way. I found I couldn't concentrate—the only thing in my mind was longing for Nils Nils. I realized there was nothing I desired except seeing her again, yet these thoughts loomed over me like dark clouds.\nI continued writing and running as usual.

I questioned myself about the reason, but only felt an elusive, indistinct intuition.\nI knew something had happened that time.

I realized that the enthusiasm and joy from the previous day had almost completely vanished, and I noticed she seemed to have fallen into a certain melancholy.\nI felt that the conversation that evening was proceeding with great difficulty.

As I walked up the stairs, I suddenly remembered that episode. I thought it was a good story, but I realized I couldn't tell it, for fear of revealing the complicated feelings I had for her.\nTo my knowledge, there had once been an episode involving Polish twin sisters.

I heard her say to me, \"This is where I live. Find a chair and sit down—I'll make some tea.\" I observed that it was a one-room apartment, with a bed at one end and a dining table at the other.\nI took off my shoes and sat on the edge of a chair, still wearing my jacket.

I heard her say to me, \"I think I'm starting to fall for you a little bit, Grete Lundnes.\"\n[2002-05-19 21:20:10] Nils Nils's house | I heard myself say to her, \"I like you too.\" I kept turning the word \"like\" over in my mind. I wondered in surprise—was she really talking to me?\nI heard myself say to her, \"I like you too.\" I kept turning the word \"like\" over in my mind. I wondered in surprise—was she really talking to me?\n[2002-05-19 21:20:20] Nils Nils's house | I heard her reply, \"Really?\" After a moment of silence, she asked again, \"Do you think we could be more than just friends?\"\nI heard her reply, \"Really?\" After a moment of silence, she asked again, \"Do you think we could be more than just friends?\"\n[2002-05-19 21:20:30] Nils Nils's house | I heard myself say, \"I want us to stay friends.\"\nI heard myself say, \"I want us to stay friends.\"\n[2002-05-19 21:21:00] Nils Nils's house | I saw her look at me, then lower her head and lift the cup to her lips. I stood up. I heard her ask me, \"Do you have any female friends? I mean, strictly just friends?\"\nI saw her look at me, then lower her head and lift the cup to her lips. I stood up. I heard her ask me, \"Do you have any female friends? I mean, strictly just friends?\"\n[2002-05-19 21:21:10] Nils Nils's house | I shook my head. I heard myself answer, \"Well, sort of. I did in high school. But that was a long time ago.\"\nI shook my head. I heard myself answer, \"Well, sort of. I did in high school. But that was a long time ago.\"\n[2002-05-19 21:22:00] Nils Nils's doorstep | I watched her look at me again. I saw her stand up and walk with me to the door. To keep her from hugging me, I didn't turn around until I was already in the hallway. I said to her, 'I think I should go. Thank you for the tea.' I heard myself say, 'Goodbye.' Her voice echoed in my ears: 'Goodbye.'\nI watched her look at me again. I saw her stand up and walk with me to the door. To keep her from hugging me, I didn't turn around until I was already in the hallway. I said to her, 'I think I should go. Thank you for the tea.' I heard myself say, 'Goodbye.' Her voice echoed in my ears: 'Goodbye.'\n[2002-05-20 10:00:00] Garden Ras Café | I arrived at Garden Ras Café, placed my notepad on the table, and began writing her a long letter. Holding the pen, I described her lips, eyes, gait, and her Japanese-like features on paper. I wrote down her laughter, the words she often used—recording everything I had seen. I knew that ever since I first saw her in 1999, she had held a special meaning for me. I remembered how her lips slid over her gums when she was excited, her deep eyes like light-absorbing black holes. I realized that although I knew little about her inner world, I knew I loved her deeply—and this love would be eternal.\nI sat in Garden Ras Café, unfolded my notepad, and started writing her a letter. I carefully sketched the sway of her hips as she walked, noted the bright expression when she crisply said words like 'stars' or 'awesome'. I recalled the shock I felt when I first saw her in 1999. I realized all her features were deeply etched into my mind. In the letter, I confessed to her that even though I didn’t understand her thoughts, everything I could see was enough to convince me that I would love her forever.\n[2002-05-20 11:00:00] Garden Ras Café | I was writing with my head down when suddenly I heard someone call my name. I jerked my head up and saw her standing right in front of me. Panicked, I flipped the notepad face-down onto the table. I heard myself say to her, 'Hi, Nils Nils, thanks for yesterday!' I felt utterly astonished that she would appear so suddenly.\nI saw her standing before me. To prevent her from discovering what I was writing, I immediately flipped the notepad over and pressed it facedown on the table. I heard her voice, then heard myself reply, 'Hi, Nils Nils, thanks for yesterday’s hospitality.' I was completely startled by this unexpected encounter.\n[2002-05-20 11:00:10] Garden Ras Café | We locked eyes, and I nodded politely to her. I heard her say, 'You're welcome. I came with a female friend. Do you still want to sit alone?' I heard myself answer, 'Yes, hope you don't mind. You know, I'm working.'\nI met her gaze, then gave her a polite nod. I heard her say she had come with a friend and asked if I preferred to be alone. I heard myself courteously reply that I wanted to stay by myself because I was working.\n[2002-05-20 11:05:00] Garden Ras Café | I saw a woman around her age emerge carrying two cups; Nils Nils then turned and walked toward her, and they sat down together at the other end of the café. I picked up my pen and wrote a line on the paper, recording the moment she just sat down over there.\nI watched Nils Nils turn away and follow a woman of similar age—who was holding two coffee cups—to the other side of the café and take a seat. I continued writing on the notepad, noting that she was now sitting nearby.\n[2002-05-20 11:30:00] Lasse Café in the garden | I inwardly sighed, thinking that I would give up everything just to overcome this distance. I thought that even if she might feel she likes me, that emotion is not enough for me—I want a mutual, equally intense burning passion. I realized being ordinary friends was meaningless, since I couldn't even talk to her normally, so I decided to be honest in my letter: I will love you forever.\nI wanted to tell her I cannot settle for shallow affection—I want it all or nothing at all. I realized our current so-called 'friendship' is merely a name, because there's a huge gap between us when it comes to conversation. I decided to confess in my letter that I've seen her at her strongest and most vulnerable, and I will always love her.\n[2002-05-20 12:00:00] Sørmalm | I finished signing the letter, stood up, glanced quickly at them, noticed her friend didn’t recognize me, and quietly slipped away. I rushed home, sealed the letter, changed into my workout clothes, and started running along Sørmalm. I just wanted to escape that scene silently and unnoticed.\nAfter signing the letter, I got up, made sure her friend hadn’t noticed me, and quickly left the café. I went home, put the letter in an envelope, changed into exercise clothes, and went for a long run around Sørmalm. I felt an uneasy sense of having fled.\n[2002-05-23 10:00:00] Håvik | In the following days, I ran and swam frantically, trying to calm my inner turmoil through physical exhaustion, and wandered aimlessly around the city. I realized that although I had rationally decided to end it, my heart was still trembling. I felt this emotional chaos could not be calmed at all—it kept me from eating or sleeping.\nI kept running and swimming across the city, like a wound-up machine never tiring. I exhausted myself completely every day. I tried to erase my inner restlessness through exercise, but I realized I had failed. I felt that emotion refused to let go—my heart remained in a bittersweet disorder.\n[2002-05-25 14:00:00] Eriksdal Swimming Hall | I decided not to go to the book club, called Karl Larsdal instead, and arranged to meet him at Kunstcafé. First, I went to Eriksdal Swimming Hall and swam for over an hour, back and forth in the outdoor pool. After finishing, I smoked a cigarette, slung my bag over my shoulder, and headed downtown. I felt the air was cold, yet the pool water was warm. I saw the gray sky drizzling rain, and no one else was around. I knew it was Saturday, May 25, 2002. I swam a thousand meters, then another thousand, until utterly exhausted, feeling heat radiating through my entire body.\nI called Karl and arranged to meet him at Kunstcafé at four. In the afternoon, I went to Eriksdal Swimming Hall and swam for a full hour. Afterward, I stood outside the hall smoking, then headed toward the city center. I was in the vast open-air pool, surrounded only by falling drizzle. I felt my body heating up from the alternation between cold air and warm water. It was the afternoon of May 25. I wanted to completely wear myself out, so I wouldn’t have to think about all those troubling things anymore.\n[2002-05-25 16:00:00] Kunstcafé | I arrived early, sat down at a window-side table, and ordered a beer. A few minutes later, I saw Karl Larsdal appear and reach out his hand; he sat down opposite me. I heard him ask, 'What’s new?' I heard myself begin telling him everything that had happened these past few days.\nI found a table, sat down with a beer, and waited for him. I watched as Karl pushed the door open and sat down in front of me. I heard his question. I told him everything I’d been through these past few days without holding back.\n[2002-05-25 16:10:00] Yiba | I heard Karl say, 'You always have to be so dramatic. Can't you just calm down a bit?' He asked me if I'd sent the letter, and I told him I hadn't.\nI heard Karl comment that I didn't have to be 'all or nothing.' When he asked about the letter, I replied that I still had it in my hand, not yet posted.\n[2002-05-25 16:15:00] Yiba | I received a text from Nils and started replying by lowering my head. Then I raised my glass toward Karl. I saw the message asking why I hadn't gone to the book club. I heard Karl complain, 'Can't you deal with that later?' I firmly replied, 'No.' I heard myself say to Karl, 'Cheers.'\nI was about to reply to her text when I saw Karl looking impatient. After sending the message, I gestured to Karl to drink. I heard Karl demand that I put the phone down. I answered that this couldn't wait. I told Karl I couldn't make it to the book club and said 'Cheers' to him.\n[2002-05-25 16:16:00] Yiba | I received another text from her and quickly typed a reply on the screen. I saw the words on the screen: 'Miss you. Where are you now?' I heard Karl threaten, 'Put it down. If you don't, I'm leaving.' I asked him to wait just a moment longer, almost done. When I saw the words 'miss you,' I felt my heart pounding in my chest. I replied that I missed her too.\nI stared at the new message on my phone screen and kept typing busily. I read her text asking for my location. Karl's angry warning rang in my ears, but I begged him for a little more time. In my message, I told her I was at Yiba. Seeing that affectionate message, I felt an intense excitement, my heartbeat suddenly accelerating.\n[2002-05-25 16:17:00] Yiba | I glanced at the newly arrived text and abruptly stood up. I heard Karl ask, 'Nils Nils, right?' I heard him say I was 'already finished.' I saw the message saying she was waiting for me at the People's Opera House. I said to him, 'Sorry, Karl Larsdal, but I have to go.'\nI saw the message on my phone screen telling me to come see her now, so I immediately stood up, ready to leave. I heard Karl exclaim that I was hopeless. I apologized to Karl and told him I had to leave right now.\n[2002-05-25 16:18:00] Yiba | I prepared to leave Yiba and saw Karl still sitting there. I heard Karl complain, 'Now? Come on, man... I took the subway all the way here, not to sit alone drinking.' I promised him, 'Sorry. I'll call you again.'\nI pushed back my chair and stood up; Karl was extremely displeased with me. Karl's protest sounded in my ear—he didn't want to drink alone here. I apologized again and told him I'd get in touch later.\n[2002-05-25 16:30:00] Taxi / People's Opera House | I rushed onto the street, flagged down a taxi, paid the fare, and hurried through the entrance of the People's Opera House. I was anxious the entire way, desperate enough to scream at the traffic lights outside.\nI ran into the street and hailed a cab, quickly arriving at my destination. I walked into the opera house lobby. I felt the wheels speeding across the pavement, my heart racing as I stared impatiently at the intersections ahead.\n[2002-05-25 16:35:00] People's Opera House | I saw her sitting on the first floor. The moment I saw her, I knew it wasn't anything urgent, so I went over, hugged her, sat down, and noticed she was smiling at me. I heard her laugh and say, 'You came so fast!' I explained, 'I felt like you had something urgent.' She replied, 'No, no, nothing urgent at all.'\nI saw her sitting on the first floor.

I explained, 'I felt like you had something urgent.' She replied, 'No, no, nothing urgent at all.'\n[2002-05-25 17:00:00] People's Opera House | I watched as we asked the waiter for a bottle of red wine. We sat there chatting casually. I heard myself ask, 'Would you like to drink something?' She answered, 'I don't know. Red wine?' I said cheerfully, 'No problem.' I felt as though an electric current surged through my body every time our eyes met—the sharp jolt was my heart being struck by lightning.\nI watched as we asked the waiter for a bottle of red wine.

I said yes. She mentioned Henrik Hagendal would be there, so I told her I'd once devoted an entire front page in the Morning Paper to harshly criticizing him, and later he referred to me as 'Falbakk' in the debate. I knew I had severely criticized Hagendal before, and as far as I knew, he still kept that review. I also learned he had targeted both Lenavik and me in public disputes.\nI heard her ask, 'There's a party at Dizzy now—do you want to go?' I said yes.

I heard myself ask, 'Should we go somewhere else?' She replied, 'No, no, oh God. Let's just go there.' Before me stretched the darkening sky; I sensed the clouds that had hung overhead all day growing thicker and heavier.\nI watched as we left the People's Opera House.

I looked around and saw Setbakken smiling at me as he spoke, then turning away to comment on me to someone else. I heard Setbakken ask, 'Isn't that Grete Lundnes?' He told others I was his rival and asked me, 'Right?' I denied it: 'I'm not.' I was in a packed basement, feeling the air hot and thick with smoke. Looking at the scene before me, I thought maybe we didn't need to stay here too long.\nI saw us taking a taxi to Dizzy.

He told me he was trying to write a new novel in my style and said, 'Just wait and see!' I replied, 'We'll talk later.' He agreed. When I heard him say he was writing a novel following my path, I thought, how flattering.\nI heard Setbakken say, 'Don't be so timid. That's all behind us now.'

I noticed Nils Nils occasionally getting up to talk with acquaintances before returning to my side. I felt myself getting increasingly drunk. I thought, in this romantic atmosphere, we were a couple. When I saw her turn back and smile at me while talking to others, I inwardly exclaimed: we are a pair.\nI watched as we went to the bar, ordered drinks, and sat down.

I saw Setbakken come in, stare into Nils Nils’s eyes, and begin massaging her feet resting on his lap. I heard Setbakken ask, 'I'm good at this, right?' Nils Nils replied, 'Yes, that feels great.' Then I heard Setbakken urge me: 'Take your shoes off.' I refused: 'I'd rather not.' He said again, 'Don't be a coward. Come on.'\nI saw us entering a small room deep inside the hall and sitting down.

I felt the rubbing on my soles was actually quite pleasant, but the moment I realized it was Henrik Hagendal giving me the foot massage, a conflicting feeling arose inside me. Staring at the smile on his face—which I could only interpret as 'evil'—I thought to myself, this scene is just too bizarre.\nI did as he said.

Holding my wine glass, I wandered around and noticed Nils Nils leaning against the wall talking to Ilda. Seeing her smile and wave at me, I immediately walked over. I looked at Nils Nils through drunken eyes, marveling at how beautiful she was. In my mind, I wondered: could she really be mine?\nI watched him squeeze my foot, then I asked him about the essay collection.

Without a word, we crossed the room and stood on the steps outside. I heard Nils Nils introduce: 'This is Ilda.' I heard Ilda say with a gentle smile: 'We've met before.' Then I heard myself say to Nils Nils: 'Come here.' She asked suspiciously: 'Now?' I was outdoors in heavy rain. I realized the moment had come—either confess now or never speak of it again. I nervously swallowed, staring into her dark eyes.\nI saw myself step forward and place a hand on her shoulder, then take her hand. Without a word, we crossed the room and stood on the steps outside.

I nervously swallowed, staring into her dark eyes.\n[2002-05-26 00:05:00] Steps Outside Dizziness | I heard myself say to her: 'I’ve pulled you aside like this before—it didn’t go well. But this time I have something to say, about you.' I heard her ask: 'About me?' I answered firmly: 'Yes.' I recalled that unsuccessful conversation back in 1999, knowing this one might end just as badly. I watched her tilt her face up toward mine, her hair wet from the rain, droplets glistening on her cheeks.\nI heard myself say to her: 'I’ve pulled you aside like this before—it didn’t go well.

Then, I felt everything fade into darkness. I heard myself pour out my love, telling her what she meant to me. I described her lips, her eyes, the way she walked. I told her tenderly that all I wanted was to be with her. I saw her rise onto her toes, stretching her neck toward me—I thought, I must let her know I love her.\nI watched myself lower my head and kiss her. Then, I felt everything fade into darkness.

I saw them stop and lean over me, then I got up and staggered forward a few steps. I heard a man say into the phone that I might be on drugs. I asked, 'Where am I?' They replied that I was outside Dizziness. I heard myself say: 'Grete Lundnes. I think I passed out. I'm completely fine now.' I was inside a gate outside Dizziness. When I first woke up, I felt utterly disoriented, with no idea where I was.\nI felt myself being dragged along the asphalt by two men holding my feet.

When I first woke up, I felt utterly disoriented, with no idea where I was.\n[2002-05-26 00:25:00] inside the outer gate of Dizziness | I saw Nils Nils walking toward me. I heard Nils Nils ask if I had woken up, and tell me that I had fainted just now. She gently said to me, 'No one has ever said such beautiful words to me.' I said to her, 'Hi, Nils Nils... I'm really sorry.' When I heard her say those words, my heart fluttered.\nI saw Nils Nils walking toward me. I heard Nils Nils ask if I had woken up, and tell me that I had fainted just now.

When I heard her say those words, my heart fluttered.\n[2002-05-26 00:30:00] outside Dizziness | I felt the man let go of me, and I nodded at him. I tried to stand up; though a bit unsteady, I managed to take a few steps. I originally thought about going home first, or asking her to stay. I heard one of the men ask, 'Are you okay now?' I replied, 'I'm fine.' I explained to Nils Nils, 'It was when you kissed me—suddenly I felt something black pulsing upward inside me, and then I woke up here.' Then I said to her, 'Better go home. If you want to stay, you can stay.' I heard her burst into laughter and say to me, 'Let's go to my place—I'll take care of you.' I said, 'You taking care of me sounds really nice.'\nI noticed the men who had been holding us back walked away. I steadied myself—though still a little shaky—and stood up. At that moment, I wanted her to stay, or for us to leave together. The man asked if I had recovered, and I nodded in response. I told Nils Nils that the kiss had made my mind go completely dark, and then I lost consciousness. I suggested going home, but she said she’d take me to her place to look after me, and I thought that sounded great.\n[2002-05-26 00:45:00] taxi | I smiled at her and pulled out my phone to call a taxi. I looked down at my rain-soaked pants and pushed my wet hair back with my hand. Ten minutes later, we got into a taxi. I said to her, 'Strange—I've sobered up, but now I'm starving.' I heard her ask when I last ate, and I answered, 'This morning yesterday.' I heard her giving the address over the phone. I saw her hair clinging to her forehead, and outside the window was pitch-black night and endless rain.\nI saw her smiling as she made the phone call. I noticed the rain had soaked my clothes, so I tidied my hair. Not long after, we got into a taxi and left. I told her I was extremely hungry now. She gave me an incredulous stare and asked when I last ate, so I admitted it was this morning yesterday. I heard her giving the address to the taxi dispatch over the phone. I felt the cold, wet fabric of my pants clinging to my legs, and saw the blurred night scenery and rain outside the car window.\n[2002-05-26 09:00:00] Nils Nils's home | When I woke up and saw Nils Nils beside me, I moved close and pressed against her. I watched her open her eyes, and then we made love again. I said to her, 'We must have children together—otherwise it would be a crime against human nature.' I heard her laugh out loud. I continued, 'It's destiny—I'm absolutely certain. I've never felt this way before.' When I first woke up, I was disoriented and didn't know where I was, until I saw her and remembered everything from last night. I felt with my entire being that this connection was perfectly right.\nI woke from sleep, realizing I was lying in her bed, so I reached out and held her. We became intimate once more. I suggested we should have children together, joking that not doing so would be a crime. I heard her laugh, and I emphasized to her that I'd never had such a fated feeling before. Fragments of last night’s fainting episode flashed through my mind; now, looking at her, everything felt exactly as it should be.\n[2002-05-26 09:10:00] Nils Nils's home | I saw her stop smiling and look at me seriously. I noticed she nodded at me. I heard her ask, 'Are you serious?' I answered, 'Yes, I am serious.' I told her I could feel her feelings too. She exclaimed, 'Is this real? You're lying in my bed saying you want to have children with me?' Finally, she said, 'But I would never say that myself.' I could sense she felt the same way deep inside.\nI gazed into her eyes, and she looked back at me. Then she nodded to me. She pressed me on whether I was serious, and I gave a definite yes. I heard her marvel that I would actually say something like wanting children while lying in bed. She said although she felt the same, she would never bring it up herself. From her expression, I could read her silent acceptance of this future.\n[2002-06-15 10:00:00] Halvik | I noticed that we were constantly clinging to each other, and no matter if we were at traffic lights, in restaurants, or on the bus, one of us would suddenly reach out to touch the other. As far as I know, it was 2002. Karl Larsdal and Kristina said we only had eyes for each other and couldn't interact with anyone else. I felt a happiness so complete and total as I'd never known in my life. I felt utterly free—when I was with her, I desired nothing else. But once apart, I longed for her with all my heart.\nI noticed we could hardly be separated, our hands always intertwined as we walked through parks or along streets. We had built a world of just the two of us. I know this was a period in 2002. Friends joked that we had completely immersed ourselves in our own little world. I experienced a happiness so exposed and raw. This unfamiliar force made me feel free, yet also intensely dependent—whenever I was away from her, I felt empty inside.\n[2002-06-21 20:00:00] Lønemar Island | During midsummer, I went to Lønemar Island. I found myself laughing and singing through the nights of Mochengdao. I felt as though the world were bathed in a new kind of light. I learned that Siv Ingrid had rented a wooden cabin on the island in June 2002. I felt absurdly happy, like a madman. I realized that everything around me had suddenly become meaningful.\nIn midsummer of June 2002, I went on vacation to Lønemar Island with her. During those nights, I sang and laughed uncontrollably. I saw that the night in Mochengdao shimmered with a glow I’d never seen before—a radiance filled with meaning. I knew we were staying in the wooden cabin rented by Siv Ingrid. I marveled at how even the smallest things in life had become vivid. This overwhelming sense of meaning excited me beyond words.\n[2002-07-15 14:00:00] Halvik | In Halvik, we went swimming, lay in the park reading, or dined at restaurants. I began reading Hölderlin’s poetry collection. We confessed everything to each other. I saw that every day from June to August was drenched in bright sunshine. His verses flowed into my heart like water. I knew it was the summer of 2002, and though autumn was approaching, we didn’t care. I realized that as long as we were doing these things together, the activities themselves no longer mattered. This ecstasy lifted me beyond myself. I knew such extreme happiness was terrifying, but I refused to turn back.",

    "text": "I spent the entire summer with her in Halvik—swimming, wandering, reading. I became deeply absorbed in Hölderlin’s poems. There were no secrets between us. Sunlight bathed our entire holiday. I felt a resonance between the poetic realm and the joy within me. It was high summer in 2002. I knew this state might not last forever. I felt an absolute sensation in the core of my being—a fusion of fire and ice. Though I sensed potential threats from the future, I chose to pretend ignorance and savor the present.\n[2002-07-20 08:00:00] Nils Nils's bedroom | One morning I was in the shower when I heard her calling me. I stepped out, entered the bedroom, and lay down beside her. We gazed at the sky together. I gripped her hand tightly. I heard her say, 'Look, can you see that cloud?' I answered that I could. She burst into laughter and said, 'Everything is perfect. I’m so happy to be with you!' I replied, 'Me too.' I saw a clear blue sky outside the window, with only one heart-shaped white cloud drifting slowly closer. The bed had been moved next to the window.\nI came out of the bathroom dripping wet and entered the bedroom. She was lying naked on the bed by the window. I lay down beside her and took her hand. She laughed joyfully. She pointed at the single cloud in the sky and asked me about it. I confirmed what she saw. Then I heard her declare that everything felt perfectly complete. I echoed her happiness. Before my eyes stretched a vast, cloudless blue sky, with one solitary cloud shaped like a heart. Sunlight slanted across the bed.\n[2002-07-25 14:00:00] Offshore islet | We took a small boat to an offshore islet and rented a wooden cabin. We wandered for hours through the island, deep into the woods, then to the edge of a steep cliff. Afterwards, we visited a pasture. We laughed at the cows, took photos of each other, and climbed trees to sit and talk. I smelled the scent of pine and heather in the air. I saw the deep blue sea below, and the cows watching us curiously. I felt as though we were two carefree children at that moment.\nWe sailed to a small island off the coast and stayed in a wooden cabin among the trees. I walked with her through the forest for a long time. We stood at the cliff’s edge looking down, then played around with cows in the pasture. We took pictures of each other and climbed up into the treetops to chat like children. The air was filled with the distinctive fragrance of the forest. I noticed the waves crashing below the steep cliff and the peaceful scene across the pasture. I marveled at the pure joy we shared then, as if we had returned to childhood.\n[2002-07-25 16:00:00] tree on a small island near the coast | I told her about something from my childhood: \"Once, I went to a gas station to buy cigarettes for my father... I saw a bird, incredibly beautiful, quite large, with dazzling colors. It flew away, and I've never seen that kind of bird again.\" I recall this was around 1976, when I was seven or eight years old. That forest path remains vivid in my memory even today. I felt that bird seemed to come from Africa or Asia.\nI recalled to her how, as a child, I once encountered a magnificent, colorful giant bird on the path while buying cigarettes—an extraordinary beauty that left a lifelong impression, though I never saw it again. I know this was from when I was seven or eight. That forest path used to be the most familiar route to me.\n[2002-07-25 16:10:00] tree on a small island near the coast | I heard Nils Nils ask in surprise, \"Really?\" She told me that when she was a child, sitting in a summerhouse tree, she had also seen an identical, brilliantly colored strange bird—and never again after that.\nShe found my experience unbelievable. She admitted having had an almost identical encounter at her summerhouse: discovering a breathtakingly beautiful bird filled with exotic hues beneath a tree, and never encountering such a bird again afterward.\n[2002-07-26 10:00:00] returning boat | We were returning from the island, sitting in a small boat. I looked out the window and saw another small boat moving through the waves. We discussed names for our future children. I said to her, \"If it's a boy, I'd like a simple name—Ola. I've always loved that name. What do you think?\" I heard her say, \"It's nice, very Leivik-like. I like it.\" I pointed out the window and said, \"Look there.\" She leaned over and said, \"Let's call him Ola.\" I saw the waves rising and falling outside. I noticed the registration plate on one side clearly marked with the large letters 'Ola'. I felt everything was becoming meaningful, as if our lives had already intertwined.\nWe were on the boat returning to Halvik. I gazed at the sea surface outside the window. I suggested naming our future son Ola and asked for her opinion. She agreed, saying the name carried a certain Leivik charm. Then I pointed out the nearby boat engraved with the word 'Ola,' and she immediately decided we should use that name. Boats rose and fell on the sea surface. I saw the prominent red registration plate. I realized all these coincidences in life seemed like footnotes to our union. I felt our lives drawing tightly together.\n[2002-08-15 22:00:00] apartment on Bastu Street | Late at night, we walked uphill. I noticed she had been silent for a long time. I stopped and looked at her. I heard her say, \"Grete Lundnes, there's something I need to tell you. I once tried to take my own life.\" I asked in shock, \"What did you say?\" She looked down at the ground without answering right away. I asked if it was long ago, and she said it was during her hospital stay about two years back. I know this was around the year 2000. I realized our relationship was still in its intense early phase. Hearing this news sent a tremor through me.\nI walked back to the apartment with her along the mountain path. I sensed the unusual silence in the air. I watched her lowered face. She suddenly opened up to me, confessing her past suicide attempt. I could hardly believe my ears. I pressed for details and learned it happened during her hospitalization two years earlier. As far as I know, that was a dark period in her past. I thought we were at the peak of our passion, yet she chose this moment to reveal a deep wound within. This weight caught me off guard.\n[2002-08-15 22:10:00] apartment on Bastu Street | I stepped forward and pulled her into my arms. We stood like that for a long time. Then we walked up the steps and entered the elevator. I unlocked the door with my key. She sat on the bed, and I walked over and opened the window. I softly asked her, \"Would you like some tea?\" She replied, \"Of course.\" I heard the sounds of the late summer night rushing in from outside the window. I sensed she needed support deeply at that moment, so I didn't want to let go.\nI held her tightly, trying to offer her comfort. We remained silent throughout the rest of the journey. After entering the apartment, she sat wearily on the edge of the bed, and I went to push open the window. I asked if she would like a cup of hot tea, and she nodded. The noises of the city at night came through the open window. I felt the lingering warmth in the late summer air. Looking at her fragile form on the bed, a wave of tenderness rose inside me. I just wanted to do something, anything, to ease this heavy atmosphere.\n[2002-08-15 22:30:00] Bastu Street apartment | I walked into the small kitchen to boil water, preparing two teacups and tea bags. I handed her one cup and leaned against the window drinking the other. She began telling me about it: her mother had come to pick her up at the apartment to retrieve some things. Just as they reached the front door, she suddenly bolted. She ran inside and dashed toward the window. At the very moment she was about to jump down, her mother lunged forward and grabbed her. I knew that was the terrifying moment from the year 2000. I knew her mother had been desperately chasing after her.\nI busied myself making tea in the kitchen. I handed her a cup and stood by the window, listening. Her voice came to my ears: on that gray afternoon, she had tried to shake off her mother and leap from their apartment window. Her mother saved her life at the last possible second. I knew that life-or-death struggle took place in her old apartment. I listened breathlessly to this heart-wrenching account. I imagined the despair and madness of that moment, and my inner world surged with emotion.\n[2002-08-15 22:40:00] Bastu Street apartment | I heard her confess to me that at the time, she felt completely insane—she even wanted to kill her mother—until her mother pinned her down on the chest and subdued her. She also mentioned that the police arrived shortly after and sent her back to the hospital. I learned this happened in 2000, during a chaotic suicide attempt when she engaged in a violent physical struggle with her mother.\nI heard her describe that terrifying fight, saying she had lost all reason until her mother overpowered her. She said it was only due to police intervention that she was taken back to the hospital. I knew this was from two years earlier, during an extremely unstable period in her life.\n[2002-08-15 22:50:00] Bastu Street apartment | I heard her describe her state at the time—she said during those days plunged deep into depression, she could barely speak and avoided seeing anyone. I heard myself ask her why she did it, and she replied that her mind hadn't been clear. I heard her say her face then was like a stiff, expressionless mask. I learned that in late summer 2000, she was hospitalized for bipolar disorder, enduring prolonged speech delays and social isolation. I looked at her, momentarily at a loss for words.\nHer voice came to me again—words had become unreachable to her then. I heard myself probing the motives behind her suicide attempt, and she told me it was due to a profound, inescapable depression. I heard her describe her appearance at the time as a lifeless mask. I knew she had suffered a severe mental crisis in 2000, so intense that doctors recommended inpatient supervision during treatment. I felt a heavy sense of helplessness, unsure how to respond to her past.\n[2002-08-15 23:00:00] Bastu Street apartment | I saw her look up at me. I sat down on the edge of the bed, then lay beside her. I noticed the woman renting the room was packing things inside the doorway. I heard her say to me, 'I was already dead... I couldn’t stay there.' She explained that the only chance to escape the hospital was during that trip back to the apartment to collect clothes. I sensed the deep night outside. I heard the clatter of a train passing over the Lidal Bay Bridge. I learned she had secretly planned her escape while confined in the psychiatric hospital.\nI watched her lift her head. I slowly sat on the edge of the bed, then lay close beside her. I noticed a coughing sound coming from the rooftop terrace upstairs. I heard her whisper about her desperate situation then—she said she had already felt like she’d said goodbye to life, and her only hope was convincing her mother to accompany her back to the apartment. I was in a quiet bedroom, the distant rumble of trains and the thick, un-summer-like darkness beyond the window filling my senses. I knew that during her 2000 hospitalization, she had desperately sought any opportunity to leave the hospital.\n[2002-08-15 23:10:00] Bastu Street apartment | I saw her fall silent for a moment. I reached out and gently stroked her hair. I looked at her and asked if she was still afraid. I heard her say that if she had truly been determined to die, all she needed to do was smash the glass and jump—she would have succeeded. I heard myself say to her, 'I'm glad you didn't.' I heard her admit she's still afraid it might happen again.\nI noticed she fell into a brief silence. I gently caressed her strands of hair. I gazed into her eyes, searching for signs of her unease. I heard her rationally analyze the possibility of suicide back then, saying that if one is truly resolved, nothing can stop it. I heard myself respond softly that I was grateful she was still alive. She nodded and admitted she still carried the fear of relapse.\n[2002-08-15 23:15:00] Bastugatan apartment | I saw her turn her head to look at me, and I moved forward to kiss her. I saw her smile as she reached out both arms and embraced me. I heard myself say firmly to her, 'I'm not afraid. Really. I understand you.' I heard her ask in return, 'Really?' Then I assured her that it would never happen again. I heard her laugh and reply that then she believed it too. I felt a silence settle around us. I noticed the sounds of the tenant woman moving about next door and a cough echoing from the rooftop terrace. I firmly believed that I understood her, convinced that my love could overcome those shadows from the past.\nI met her gaze and bent down to kiss her. I felt the strength in her arms as she held me tightly. I heard myself declare resolutely that I wasn't afraid of her history. I heard her voice, full of doubt yet hope, asking back. I swore to her that everything would pass, and she laughed, expressing her trust in me. I was in the small room on Bastugatan, surrounded by faint neighborhood sounds. I was certain in my heart that with my presence, those tragedies would never repeat themselves.\n[2002-08-20 15:00:00] Basement/Årstad | I divided all our belongings with Tone. I took our cat and drove to my mother's house in Årstad. I knew it was late summer 2002, and my marriage to Tone had quietly come to an end. I remembered suddenly bursting into tears when I went down to the basement to retrieve something, realizing that eight years of shared life were truly over, and I felt a deep sorrow.",

    "text": "[2002-08-20 22:00:00] Hårvik | I got into a black taxi and wandered through different bars and cafés across the city. I felt how bright and open the summer night was, as if sky and earth had merged into one. I noticed how the thick darkness eventually solidified into a wall, and morning rose. I realized the shifting light of the summer night was nearly indescribable in reality, like a dream impossible to retell. I knew the summer of 2002 was filled with endless drinking and late-night wanderings.\nI rode the black taxi through Hårvik’s nightscape, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends. I let myself drown in waves of alcohol. Before my eyes lay Hårvik’s intensely bright summer nights, with light drifting everywhere. I felt the night shift from lightness to density, until finally it hardened. I knew it was the summer of 2002, and those daylight-bright nights left a deep impression on me. I inwardly lamented that once those radiant nights had passed, trying to recount them in words always felt so futile.\n[2002-08-25 16:00:00] Mother's house in Årstad | I heard myself confessing to my mother about Nils Nils. I heard her say disapprovingly that I couldn’t date others because I only ever saw myself. She even compared me to my father, saying he could instantly see through people while I never could. I heard myself reply, 'Yes, maybe I can’t.' I knew it was August 2002, and I was visiting my mother in Årstad. I realized this was the first time my mother had ever gotten angry at me. Though her words surprised me, I didn’t think they mattered much.\n[2002-08-25 16:30:00] Mother's house in Årstad | I was certain my mother was right, but I didn’t care. What surprised me was that she placed the detestable father above me—and was actually angry with me. I realized that back then, immersed in passionate love, I must have appeared to her utterly radiant.\n[2002-09-10 10:00:00] Bastugatan apartment | I sat every day in the apartment writing, trying to introduce the theme of angels into the story about the maternity ward. I watched Nils Nils ride her bike to school each morning. I learned that in September 2002, Nils Nils began foundation courses at the drama school. I knew I was struggling with a novel about a maternity ward in 1944. I realized the text I was writing felt distant and false, but I didn’t mind—because the only focus in my life was Nils Nils.\nI sat at the desk on Bastugatan, struggling page after page, though progress in my writing was poor, I kept going anyway. I knew Nils Nils was undergoing intense training at the drama school. At the time, I was developing the story of Lena Jorgensdatter’s ancestors. I found myself unable to grasp that story—the sense of falseness troubled me—but as long as I thought of Nils Nils, everything else became irrelevant.\n[2002-09-22 12:00:00] Oscar Café | Nils Nils and I sat outside Oscar Café. I was eating a club sandwich while watching her eat chicken salad. I noticed several sparrows hopping and pecking at the still-untouched plates. I felt the Sunday quiet along the street. I heard church bells ringing below for worship. I knew it was Sunday, September 22, 2002, and we were having lunch in East Malmö.\nI saw Nils Nils sitting outside the café with a blanket over his legs. I watched the sparrows darting nimbly around the tables. I was in Karasjok Square under autumn sunlight, surrounded by the special tranquility of a Sunday. I heard bells echoing through the air. I knew it was an ordinary Sunday after we had moved in together.\n[2002-09-22 12:10:00] Oscar Café | I looked up and saw a giant bird swoop down from the sky, snatching a sparrow off the table with its claws. I turned back to Nils Nils. I burst out laughing at her. I heard myself ask, 'Did a big bird just carry off a little sparrow, or am I dreaming?' I heard Nils Nils exclaim, 'I've never seen anything like that before. It's terrifying.' I saw a shadow sweep across, heard the great bird screech as it dove toward us. I saw Nils Nils with her mouth half-open, staring fixedly into the sky. This fierce spectacle of nature strangely excited me. Seeing the glint of amusement in Nils Nils’s eyes, my mood lifted too.\nI witnessed the sudden killing, watching the giant bird swiftly soar away. I stared at Nils Nils’s shocked expression. I heard myself jokingly confirm what had just happened, while Nils Nils expressed sympathy for the poor little bird. I guessed it was an eagle; she smiled at me. I felt how the peaceful afternoon had suddenly been shattered by the bird’s predatory strike. I saw flashes of gray-green light flickering in her eyes. I realized I felt an indescribable joy in the midst of this bloody yet vivid scene.\n[2002-09-22 12:15:00] Oscar Café | I heard myself telling Nils Nils about my grandfather, how he used to trick me by saying a little eagle had carried off his hair. I heard Nils Nils laugh and say, 'Now you’ve seen it!' I joked back, 'Don’t know if it was the same one.' I remembered how, as a child, I actually believed my grandfather’s tall tale about why he was bald. I recalled how I used to gaze up at the sky as a kid, searching for the 'little eagle' that stole my grandfather’s hair, and couldn't help but marvel at the whimsy of those childhood memories.\nI told her about the funny scene where my grandfather demonstrated how the little eagle grabbed his hair. I heard her pick up the thread quickly. I responded to her, our words filled with nostalgia. I knew my grandfather really did have only a half-circle of white hair left when he was older. I realized those childhood imaginings were now connected to this real-life eagle I’d just seen.\n[2002-09-22 12:20:00] Oscar Café | I heard Nils Nils say with a smile that when she was five, a large bird had once snatched her pet hamster right before her eyes from the grass. I gasped, 'Really?' She nodded firmly, 'Yes, really.' I learned it was a tragedy she witnessed with her own eyes on a summer day in 1977, on the porch of their summer cabin. I thought how something once frightening now carried a strange beauty in the way she told it.\nI heard her describe the 'whoosh' sound as the hamster was taken. I pressed for details, and she confirmed that childhood nightmare for me. I knew it was something that happened when she was five years old. I reflected on how nature’s cruelty appears to a child as nothing more than a sudden, inexplicable disappearance.\n[2002-09-22 12:25:00] Oscar Café | I laughed loudly, pushed aside my plate, lit a cigarette, and leaned back. I looked at Nils Nils, who smiled as she listened to me. I said to her, 'I remember my grandfather had a rifle... shot one leg clean off a crow.' I described the one-legged crow glaring like Captain Ahab, and my grandfather patrolling the yard like Moby Dick. I heard Nils Nils say I would’ve liked her grandfather too. I learned that my grandfather once shot crows at that modest farm. Looking at her, I genuinely regretted that she’d never get to meet my grandfather.\nI lit another cigarette and leaned back in my chair, continuing to talk. I gazed into her eyes. I described to her the one-eyed, one-legged crow that Sjertan had told me about. I made light of the absurd image. I heard Nils Nils show deep interest in my family stories and mention her own grandfather. I knew the one-legged crow had survived on the farm and become a legend. I realized that in these conversations, our childhoods and family memories were slowly weaving together.\n[2002-09-22 12:30:00] Oscar Café | I saw her grab my pack of cigarettes and pull out a smoke. I noticed a trace of sadness in her expression as she lit it. I heard myself ask her about how her grandfather died. I heard her say she hadn’t managed to arrive in time when he had a stroke. She told me her grandmother had been closest to her. Then I heard her ask, 'Did I ever tell you my grandmother saw red northern lights?' I learned her grandfather passed away in Rogadal. I knew she had been on the road at the time and missed seeing him one last time. I saw the way she lit her cigarette, silently nodded to her, and didn’t interrupt her story.\nI watched her skillfully take a cigarette from my pack. I observed the focused expression on her face as memories stirred. I asked her about the funeral. I heard her speak fondly of her grandmother, saying her grandmother often came to Halvik to help with cleaning and cooking. I heard her suddenly shift the topic and begin telling the story about the red aurora. I learned that her grandfather died of a stroke. I knew her grandmother had been very capable and hardworking during her lifetime. I sensed a special attachment she had toward her grandmother, a feeling that seemed to extend into how she viewed her mother.\n[2002-09-22 12:35:00] Oscar Cafe | I heard her say her grandmother once saw the entire sky turn red while walking. She said later she and her mother witnessed the red aurora themselves in Humle Park. She mentioned that her grandmother cried upon hearing this. I heard her say it was later confirmed to be a rare meteorological phenomenon. I heard her describe the red aurora surging back and forth across the sky, carrying a beauty reminiscent of an apocalyptic world. I knew the red aurora was an extremely rare natural phenomenon, and not everyone believed it existed. Hearing her describe the moment her grandmother wept, I felt in my heart a resonance and comfort that transcended generations.\nI looked at Nils Nils as he spoke to me, then shook my head toward her. I heard her say her mother was becoming more and more like her grandmother. I heard her ask me, 'Did I tell you my grandmother saw the red aurora?' I knew that after her mother left the Royal Theatre and moved to the countryside, she started growing her own vegetables, and there were four freezers filled with ingredients at home.\n[2002-09-22 12:40:00] Oscar Cafe | I heard her recount the story of her grandmother seeing the red aurora during a walk. She mentioned that later, she and her mother had seen the same sight in Humle Park. She told me it was later confirmed to be a rare meteorological phenomenon. An image formed in my mind from her description: the entire sky turning red, the aurora pulsing back and forth overhead. I learned that the red aurora was a very rare meteorological phenomenon. I thought, it must have been a scene both apocalyptic and breathtakingly beautiful.\nI heard Nils Nils speak of the grandmother’s memory of seeing the red aurora. She told me that years later, she and her mother also witnessed this marvel and immediately called her grandmother afterward. She added that her grandmother burst into tears upon hearing it. I sensed that the red aurora in her description carried a surreal kind of beauty. As far as I knew, the red aurora was indeed a real but exceedingly rare natural wonder. I could imagine the awe they must have felt in that moment.\n[2002-09-22 12:50:00] Oscar Cafe | I leaned across the table and kissed her lightly. I went into the shop and ordered two coffees, then came out and placed a cup in front of her. I saw her looking up at me. I heard myself ask, 'Coffee?' She nodded at me. I heard her tell the story of seeing an airship glide over the treetops in a forest on the archipelago and then disappear. I felt that the airship story sounded utterly magical that afternoon.\nI leaned over and kissed her by the table. I got up, bought coffee, and handed her a cup. I noticed she was watching me. I heard myself ask if she wanted coffee, saw her nod in response. She told me she once saw an airship descend from the sky and vanish again in a forest on an island. I silently marveled—this scene sounded both strange and enchanting.\n[2002-09-22 13:00:00] Oscar Cafe | I heard myself say, 'I've always been fascinated by airships, ever since childhood.' I heard her summarize my childhood obsessions with divers, astronauts, and sailboats. I replied, 'Yes, more or less.' I knew I'd always had a particular obsession with these marginal forms of transportation since I was young. I realized airships had always held a certain magic for me—I even felt I was beginning to lose myself in it completely.\nI told him, 'My interest in airships began in childhood.' I heard her list the divers and astronauts I used to draw as a child, and she asked if those were the only ones. I told her yes, exactly. I realized my childhood fascinations mostly revolved around unusual things. I pondered the sense of mystery airships brought me, wondering what would happen if I truly understood that magic.\n[2002-09-22 13:10:00] Oscar Cafe | I heard her interpret all this as a 'wild desire to travel far away.' She analyzed each one: divers represented the deepest depths, astronauts the highest heights, sailboats history, and airships a world that could never come true. She told me that as a child, my mind was full of worlds—that was the meaning of life itself. I found her explanation deeply insightful—these vehicles really did belong to the 'periphery.' I realized these childhood thoughts didn't need to be resisted at all.\nI heard her ask me how I would explain this fascination, suggesting these symbols represented a longing for the world and distant places. She told me the airship stood for a world beyond reach. She remarked that as a child, I had been searching for meaning in life, and there was no need to endlessly resist such a tendency. I agreed with her, realizing that as a child I had indeed been seeking something beyond the everyday—a part of the whole world.\n[2002-09-22 13:20:00] Zoo Island Bridge | I saw us both stand up and start walking toward the bridge leading to Zoo Island. I heard her ask, 'Then what? Do you still long to leave now?' I replied loudly, 'Are you crazy?! This summer has definitely been the first since I was sixteen that I haven't had that urge at all.'\nI rose with her and walked together toward the bridge leading to Zoo Island. I heard her ask whether I still had that desire to escape. I firmly told her this summer was the first since adulthood that I hadn't felt any wish to leave.\n[2002-09-22 13:30:00] Zoo Island Bridge | I heard her ask if I knew the first airship had no rudder, and that they once tried training birds of prey to carry control ropes. I answered, 'No, I didn't know that.' Then I heard myself say, 'I only know that I love you.' I knew the first airship indeed had technical issues with controllability.\nI heard her tell me about early airships attempting to use hawks to steer directions. I told her I didn’t know about that. I confessed to her, 'I only know that I love you.'\n[2002-10-05 10:00:00] Harvik | I knew we used to get up early then—she went to class while I wrote all day. I learned we often went to bars in the evenings, like the People's Opera, Golden Monkey, or those on Oden Square. I felt an intense sense of freedom, even though daily life was full of small routines. I realized that beyond our two-person world, nothing else seemed to exist. I noticed that as long as I was with her, I needed nothing else.\nAs far as I knew, our lives during that time revolved entirely around each other. I understood our daily rhythms and the bars we frequented. I experienced complete happiness. I realized we had built an exclusive little world—beyond each other, we desired nothing else.\n[2002-10-12 10:00:00] Café | I saw myself sitting in a café reading the newspaper. I heard Nils Nils ask me, 'Do you have to read the paper? Can't we just talk?' I replied, 'Yes, of course we can.' I realized some small things in our life had begun to lose their shine—the flame no longer burned as brightly as before. I found myself developing a slight desire to be alone, to read without interruption. I realized this tiny dark spot, though fleeting, was changing my mindset. I thought inwardly: If you truly loved me, you wouldn't make these demands—but I didn't say it aloud.",

    "text": "I sat by a café table flipping through the newspaper, watching Nils Nils staring down at the tabletop. I heard her ask me to talk with her instead of just reading the paper. I closed the newspaper and told her yes. I knew subtle negative feelings had begun to appear in our life. I felt pressure from being asked for time. The desire to be alone grew stronger, eventually triggering resistance within me.\n[2002-10-15 19:00:00] Southern Malmö Italian Restaurant | I watched Nils Nils gather all her friends at an Italian restaurant in Southern Malmö. I saw her at thirty—radiant, vibrant, glowing with energy. A surge of pride and gratitude welled up inside me. I felt proud to be with someone so extraordinary.\n[2002-10-15 20:00:00] Bastugata apartment | I hung up the phone call from Henrik Inge. I noticed Nils Nils watching me from across the room. I heard her ask who it was, and I told her it was Henrik. She questioned why I had agreed to go to Shannest. I replied, \"What are you talking about? It's none of your business.\"\nI saw myself put down the phone and meet her gaze. I heard Nils Nils express dissatisfaction with my plan to go out with friends. I told her I had already promised Henrik. I emphasized to her that this was my personal social life and didn't require her interference.\n[2002-10-15 20:10:00] Bastugata apartment | I saw her lower her head and stare at the book she was reading, her expression dark. I looked at her, and finally she said 'fine' to me. I heard myself tell her I needed to spend time with my old friend because I didn't know anyone else in Hårvik. I heard her say, 'Then go.' I replied, 'Okay.' I realized I had to make things clear—I didn't want to upset her over this, but neither did I want this sense of control to continue.\nI stared at her back as she read, feeling the heaviness in the air. I spoke to her, explaining my reasons. I told her my friends were all in Leivik and I needed social interaction. I heard her reluctantly agree to my plan to go to Shannest, and I briefly responded with an 'okay'. I felt this sense of being restrained forced me to take a firmer stance to protect my own space.\n[2002-10-15 22:30:00] Hårvik streets | I saw us walking hand in hand back home. I felt the entire city glowing around us. I noticed she was wearing the white jacket I had given her as a gift that morning. Wave after wave of happiness surged through me. At the heart of this foreign city, I found the feeling of walking hand in hand with her utterly beautiful.\n[2002-10-15 23:00:00] Bastugata apartment | I watched us lying in bed preparing to sleep. I heard Nils Nils apologize to me for being ungenerous earlier. I said to her, \"We can't be stuck together our whole lives.\" I heard her say she thought the current situation was fine—she understood my point, but didn't necessarily agree.\nI rested in bed with her. I heard her gentle apology and responded that it was just a small matter. I suggested we should keep some distance and not always cling to each other. I heard her say, understandingly but with reservations, in return.\n[2002-10-15 23:00:00] Vesder apartment | I knew we had passionately discussed having children. I understood our lives had undergone a fundamental change. I felt that passion still burned between us. I realized I had never considered philosophical questions about lifestyle—I had simply followed my feelings. I noticed this state was even more evident in Nils Nils. I felt only happiness lay ahead of us.\n[2002-10-20 10:00:00] Shannest/Hårvik | I knew I had spent a lot of money on a thirtieth birthday gift for her. I realized September had passed and my writing had made no progress. I found that during my time in Shannest I called her twice every day. I realized I would have to work twice as hard upon returning home, having already squandered the entire long summer in happiness.\nI knew Nils Nils’s thirtieth birthday was approaching. I realized my finances and spirit had been greatly depleted during this period. Looking back from Shannest at life in Hårvik, I realized I must break free from the current state and bury myself in work. I found that even from afar, I remained deeply attached to her—calling twice a day.\n[2002-10-20 10:00:00] Vesder apartment | I knew I had received an invitation to teach at the Bergen Writers’ School, recommended by Jorgensen. I understood that Nils Nils did not want me to be away from her for as long as two weeks. I wanted to accept the invitation because I respected Jorgensen, and my writing needed a change. I realized that two weeks was indeed a long time for her, but deep down, I yearned for this opportunity.\n[2002-10-20 11:00:00] Halvik | I knew it had been four years since my debut novel was published, and my new book consisted of only hundreds of scattered opening pages. I recalled that Ingeborg Bu had once encouraged me. I remembered that story about catching crabs on a summer night, sensing the heat and the atmosphere of dead seagulls. I found myself stuck on this narrative for months, yet had no idea where it should lead. I felt a deep sense of creative frustration.\nI knew it had been four years since my debut was published, and my second book was still nowhere in sight—only eight hundred pages of fragmented beginnings remained. I thought of that story about catching crabs on a summer night. Though Ingeborg Bu once told me, 'Your chance has come,' I still didn’t know where this story would ultimately go.\n[2002-10-20 12:00:00] Halvik | I learned that the story involved a woman in a maternity ward during the 1940s, who was an ancestor of Lena Jorgennes. I felt that the story about the old shack and the baby read as utterly false. I kept trying new approaches, yet grew increasingly disappointed, even beginning to doubt whether I was capable of writing another novel at all.\nI knew I had tried to describe scenes from a maternity ward in the 1940s, and that old shack littered with bottles. I looked at the passages about two brothers sleeping in the house after their father’s death, and sensed how utterly fake they felt. This inability to break through left me deeply frustrated.\n[2002-10-21 20:00:00] Vesder apartment | I picked up the phone and called my mother, bringing up the teaching position in Bergen. I heard my mother say on the other end of the line that since we didn’t have children, Nils Nils should learn to live independently for a week or two—it was my work, after all. I realized that although my mother’s words were blunt, they made perfect sense.\n[2002-10-22 00:00:00] Vesder apartment | I knew that the apartment in Vesder had only one and a half rooms. I felt a strong sense of claustrophobia—the dark, cramped apartment seemed ready to swallow our lives whole. I realized that even though we lived so close, the feeling of being alone inside myself had grown stronger than ever.\n[2002-10-25 22:00:00] Slussen gas station | I walked with her to the gas station beside Slussen. I watched as she suddenly turned around and walked ten meters ahead without a word, leaving me to silently follow behind. I heard her suddenly shout curses at me out of nowhere, telling me to die. I heard myself ask what was wrong, but she refused to answer. I sensed it was a late autumn or early winter night, deep into the darkness. I knew she was on her way to rehearsal at that moment.\n[2002-10-25 22:00:00] Grønland Market | We went to the market together. When I suggested making pancakes, I noticed the mocking look she gave me. In the end, I saw her turn away from me coldly. I heard her say pancakes were for children, questioning if I was planning a kids’ party. I heard myself retort whether calling them 'crêpes' would satisfy her. I was in Grønland Market, surrounded by its noisy bustle. I knew we had planned to have dinner with Ilda and Magnus that afternoon.",

    "text": "[2002-10-28 20:00:00] Bastugata apartment | I stayed alone in the apartment working all evening. At midnight, I suddenly heard a knock at the door. I noticed a text message I had just sent her saved in my phone, in which I wrote that I loved her. I knew it was the first Monday after Shannest returned. I had assumed she’d already gone home after drinking with friends. When I heard the knock, I realized it was her.\nAt midnight, I heard a knock on the door. I opened it and saw Nils Nils standing outside. I saw several text messages exchanged between us displayed on my phone screen, where I told her to have fun and expressed my love. I learned that she had been drinking beer nearby with Kora earlier. I thought our text conversation had ended, never expecting her to show up at my door in person.\n[2002-10-29 00:00:00] Bastugata Apartment | I watched her walk into the hallway and skillfully take off her jacket and shoes. I heard myself say to her, 'You're here? I told you I needed to write.' I heard her explain that my texts were so passionate she felt I must really want to see her. I heard her ask if she could just stay and sleep here. I realized she came anyway, knowing full well I needed a quiet environment to work—this made me feel pressured.\nI watched her start undressing after entering, clearly preparing to stay the night. I heard myself emphasize that I had to work. She told me she might actually help my writing. I heard myself complain that I couldn't even write if there was just a cat in the room. I felt she was trying to break through the boundaries of my creative space.\n[2002-10-29 00:05:00] Bastugata Apartment | I heard myself reluctantly reply, 'Alright.' Though angry inside, I realized I couldn't say no—I couldn't let her think my manuscript mattered more than she did, even though it actually did.\nI heard my voice agreeing to her request. I felt a sense of defeat from being unable to refuse. I realized I was caught in an emotional game.\n[2002-10-29 00:30:00] Bastugata Apartment/Street | I drank tea with her, then watched as she undressed and went to bed. Half an hour later, I stood up and told her I was going out for a walk. I saw her lying in bed less than a meter from my desk, making the room feel especially cramped. I looked out the window at the pitch-black night. I felt a suffocating pressure, realizing I couldn't concentrate with her present. I wanted to go out in the middle of the night as a silent protest, to show her how unbearable this disturbance was.\nI watched her settle into that small bed while I sat at my desk, unable to write a single word. Then I put on my coat and walked out of the room. The indoor light fell on her back, and I felt a sense of oppression from my space being invaded. I realized I had to leave the apartment just to breathe. I decided to make a late-night exit to show her my discomfort and protest.\n[2002-10-29 01:00:00] Sørmalm Street/Park | I walked into the street, bought a grilled sausage at a gas station, then sat on a park bench and smoked five cigarettes in a row. Before my eyes lay the misty streets of Sørmalm; I gazed at the shimmering city lights below. In the cold night wind, I felt lost about the future, troubled by how to end this suffocating situation.\nI sat alone in the park, smoking cigarette after cigarette. I felt surrounded by a hazy fog, the city's noise distant and muffled within it. I kept thinking over and over—where should this entangled relationship go?\n[2002-10-30 15:00:00] Halvicks Street | I worked until dawn, then slept the entire day. In the afternoon, I took a walk outside with Nils Nils. I heard her ask me straight out, 'Don’t you want to continue with me anymore?' I heard myself reply that I still wanted to be together. I heard myself explain that I had to work late nights. I realized she had already sensed my avoidance.\nI was awakened by her from my dream, and then we walked through the streets of Håvik. I heard her complain that we would never see each other again. I heard myself repeatedly emphasize the necessity of work, trying to make her understand my situation. I felt our conversation spiraling into a dangerous deadlock.\n[2002-10-30 15:10:00] Håvik Street | I looked into her serious and threatening gaze. I sighed helplessly. I heard her threaten to leave me if I didn't change my routine. I heard myself protest that she couldn't control me. Finally, I heard myself give in: 'It's really not that important. I'll change.' I realized that to preserve this relationship, I had to temporarily yield to her demands.\nI walked beside her down the street, noticing the determination in her eyes. I finally nodded. I heard her insist this was a reasonable demand for a lover. I heard myself ultimately back down, promising to change my work habits. I felt a heavy sense of lost freedom.\n[2002-10-31 10:00:00] Bastugata Apartment | The next day, I picked up the phone and called Karl Larsdal, pouring out my recent troubles to him. I heard Karl laugh loudly on the phone, calling me a 'tall wimp,' insisting that a writer should never compromise on creative habits. I heard myself admit that yes, I really was weak. I realized I was caught in a dilemma: either abandon my creative routine or lose this relationship.\n[2002-11-01 00:00:00] Håvik | I saw the September leaves turn from yellow to red and fall one after another. The sun hung low in the sky, and I felt the air grow crisp, the sky taking on a deep blue hue.\n[2002-11-02 14:00:00] Håvik | We often took weekend walks. I watched her suddenly fall silent and gloomy. I saw the beautiful cityscape changing color in late autumn. I felt that my once-vibrant life was suddenly shrouded in darkness. I realized that for the first time since coming to Håvik, the feeling of loneliness had resurfaced within me.\n[2002-11-05 00:00:00] Vesder Apartment | I realized she fell into a mental slump that autumn. Though I sensed her reaching out for help, that suffocating sense of closure made me instinctively want to retreat, desperately trying to maintain some distance.\n[2002-11-10 14:00:00] Søndre Malm / Old Town Ice | I held her hand, stumbling across the icy surface of the Old Town. We took photos of each other. Then we ran into a café to look at the pictures, rented a movie, and went home to spend the evening together. I felt the temperature drop sharply, saw all the canals of Håvik covered in thick ice. I bathed in the sharp, clear sunlight of that Sunday. I realized that although the day was ordinary, it was precious as if gilded in gold. I felt my feelings for her become crystal clear in that moment.\n[2002-11-15 10:00:00] Venice | I traveled alone to Venice, sitting in the attic of the publisher’s apartment writing. Then I saw Nils Nils appear in my apartment. I was in that unfamiliar Venetian apartment with an attic. I knew we had planned to spend less than a week together in Venice. I felt the atmosphere turn dark and harsh with her arrival. I kept hearing her accuse me of not loving her, not wanting her—this repetitive complaint left me utterly exhausted.\n[2002-11-18 15:00:00] Murano Island | I walked across Murano Island wearing sunglasses to shield my eyes, braving the biting wind. I heard myself offer a pale, feeble defense: 'I do want to!' I felt the autumn wind howling across the island. I realized her accusations were slowly becoming true—my inner sense of detachment was intensifying.\n[2002-11-20 00:00:00] Venice | I sat in my apartment in Venice and wondered: where did her despair come from? Was it caused by my coldness and selfishness?",

    "text": "[2002-11-20 10:00:00] Venice apartment | I locked myself in the attic of my Venice apartment, writing furiously, only coming downstairs when I had to go to the grocery store. I also remembered those nights when we made love wildly. Her shouting that I didn't love her echoed in my ears, over and over again. I saw narrow alleys empty and still, canals filled with black, coffin-like gondolas. I felt the eerie chill radiating from the stone walls. I knew this was an extremely oppressive trip we had taken together in Venice. I felt that everything outside the window was lifeless. I realized those intimate acts felt more like mutual harm, and the words I wrote were utterly worthless.\n[2002-11-20 18:00:00] Venice apartment | Every time I finished working and went to find her, I was filled with uncertainty. I wondered if she was happy, or if she would blame me for not loving her enough because we’d stopped making love as often. I recalled our walks on Long Island, wondering in my mind whether she would again demand total possession of me, pushing me to keep my distance—this pointless cycle left me exhausted.\n[2002-11-22 14:00:00] Venice apartment | One day, sitting alone in the cold Venice apartment, I suddenly remembered Setbakken once saying he would imitate my path and write novels. My face flushed with heat as I realized he had actually been mocking me. I sighed inwardly, ashamed at how foolish and arrogant I had been, failing to detect the sarcasm behind his words.\n[2002-11-22 14:10:00] Venice alley | I abruptly got up, went downstairs, dressed myself, and wandered aimlessly through the alleys beside the canal for an hour. Before me lay the filthy, dark green water and ancient stone walls. I saw that the entire world seemed crooked and broken. I tried to suppress the overwhelming self-hatred within me by walking through the alleys, preventing this emotion from drowning me again.\n[2002-11-22 15:10:00] Venice Grand Square | I walked into a square that suddenly appeared before me, sat down, ordered a coffee, lit a cigarette, leaned back in my chair, and looked up at the sky. I felt as though I had previously been wandering underground in a maze of streets until the square opened up the sky above rooftops and spires. I found the sky and sun so real. I noticed my fingers looked strangely large against the small coffee cup. Looking at the open sky, I felt suddenly unburdened, my body feeling lighter. I even wondered whether Setbakken might have mistaken my enthusiastic response at the time as irony.\n[2002-11-25 00:00:00] Vesder apartment | I felt myself growing increasingly closed off, and Nils Nils’s attacks on me intensified accordingly. Like a meteorologist, I tracked her ever-changing moods and unconsciously adjusted my own emotions. I realized this cycle of outbursts and compensation never ended; although I sometimes felt strong, the sense of inner loneliness grew stronger than ever.\n[2002-11-26 00:00:00] Vesder apartment | I realized that during this short period, both of us clearly understood that neither was someone who did things half-heartedly.\n[2002-11-27 21:00:00] Vesder apartment | I heard us arguing and then making up, after which we began discussing having children. I learned that Nils Nils intended to have a child while studying, and her psychologist supported the idea. I knew she had already prepared herself for it.\n[2002-11-28 22:00:00] Vesder apartment | I suddenly said to her that perhaps we should put off having children for now. I saw the television in the corner glowing quietly. Outside the window, the autumn darkness stretched deep like an ocean.\n[2002-11-28 22:01:00] Vesder apartment | I saw Nils Nils staring at me intently, then she suddenly stood up and slapped me across the face with all her strength. I heard myself repeat, 'Maybe we should just put it aside.'\n[2002-11-28 22:02:00] Vesder apartment | I heard her scream hysterically, 'Never!' I felt my face burning with pain and couldn't help but snap back, 'What are you doing? Are you crazy?'\n[2002-11-28 22:05:00] Vesder apartment | I turned and walked into the hallway, taking my coat from the hook. I heard her sobbing desperately behind me, begging me to stay the night. I told her firmly, 'I'm leaving. And I'm never coming back. So you might as well forget about it.'\n[2002-11-28 22:10:00] Vesder apartment | I hesitated in the darkness by the door, looking at her, then I turned around. I asked her if she thought she could do whatever she wanted. I heard her apologizing over and over, pleading for me to stay that night. Finally, I said, 'Alright, I'll stay tonight. But I'm still leaving.' I heard her whisper a quiet thank you.\n[2002-11-29 07:00:00] Roof of old house on Bastugatan | Early the next morning, I returned to my old apartment without breakfast. I took a cup of coffee up to the rooftop terrace and sat smoking. I sat high up, overlooking the entire city. I sat on the terrace, deep in thought, convinced in my heart that I could no longer be with her—we were truly finished.\n[2002-11-29 12:00:00] Bridge/Path outside Nordic Museum | I called Karl Larsdal and arranged to meet him on Djurgården, then we met up on the bridge outside the Nordic Museum. We walked along a path covered in fallen leaves. I heard Karl suggest that I follow my feelings. I told him I didn’t know what I was feeling. But he insisted, 'You must know.' I saw the brick-gray sky, the path beneath my feet littered with yellow, red, and brown leaves. I felt the desolation emanating from the leafless trees. I felt so ashamed about the argument that I didn’t mention the slap at all. I was deeply conflicted, unsure of what to do.\n[2002-11-29 14:00:00] Halviken | I felt two powerful emotions warring inside me. One warned that if I didn’t leave, I would lose my freedom and independence as a writer; the other reminded me that she was the only one who truly knew who I was, the only one who gave me a sense of belonging. I realized these two forces were pulling me apart, but that day, the urge to leave prevailed.\n[2002-11-29 18:30:00] Inside subway car / Outside Vesder apartment | I arrived at Nils Nils’s apartment. Though I had a key, I still rang the doorbell. I saw her open the door and look me over with a cautious smile. On the subway, I received her call and heard her ask if I wanted to come home for crab. I replied, 'Okay, we need to talk anyway.'\n[2002-11-29 19:10:00] Dining table at Vesder apartment | I followed her to the table. I heard her ask if I was hungry. I told her I was starving. She said dinner would be ready soon. I saw the dining table below the window, covered with a white cloth, the flames of three candles flickering in the draft. On the table lay crabs, white bread, and butter.\n[2002-11-29 19:20:00] Dining table at Vesder apartment | I began pulling off crab legs and cracking open shells. I saw her opening a bottle of wine. I passed her a plate of crab meat. I heard her admit she wasn’t very good with crabs and asked if I knew how to open them. I asked what she’d been doing today and heard her say she had visited Siv Inge and told her about hitting me.\n[2002-11-29 19:40:00] Vesder apartment dining table | I heard her gaze at me and ask, 'Can you forgive me?' I replied that of course I could. But then I questioned her why she had lost control like that.\n[2002-11-29 19:45:00] Vesder apartment dining table | I saw her pressing the crab shell onto a slice of bread, trying to pry out the meat with a knife. I noticed her eyes becoming moist. I heard her apologizing to me repeatedly. She explained that because it was I who first brought up having a child, when I later said we should put it on hold, it hit her too hard and made her completely lose control.\n[2002-11-29 20:00:00] Vesder apartment dining table | I heard her ask if I understood how she felt, and I nodded and said yes. But I told her very seriously that I couldn't tolerate her lashing out at me and physically striking me. I heard her promise me she would learn to control herself from now on. I realized we couldn't become enemies—this kind of extreme conflict had drained all my energy.\n[2002-11-29 20:30:00] Vesder apartment dining table | I paused mid-speech and lowered my head to eat. I heard her ask me with a smile if it tasted good. I replied that it really was delicious. I tasted the reddish-brown crab meat on the bread, feeling the sea saltiness, the sweetness of mayonnaise, and the tang of lemon blend together in my mouth. I fell into thought. Though I still wanted to have a child with her—and that desire had never felt more certain—I began asking myself whether this certainty was worth paying any price for.",

    "text": "[2002-12-05 19:00:00] restaurant | I introduced my mother to Nils Nils. I sat in the restaurant, watching their interaction. I saw Nils Nils shine brightly—cheerful and open—and this made me feel that everything was going smoothly.\n[2002-12-05 22:00:00] Bastu Street apartment building entrance | I escorted my mother to the apartment building entrance. After watching her walk inside, I immediately turned and ran toward Nils Nils's apartment. I said goodnight to my mother.\n[2002-12-06 09:00:00] cafe | The next morning, I picked up my mother for breakfast. I heard my mother complain that it took her an hour to get in last night because the hallway light kept turning off automatically. I told her it was Mochengdao’s energy-saving automatic timer switch. I laughed at her, saying she always did this—didn’t see the lit switch and mistook it for an alarm. She asked me about the lighter, and I smiled and asked her back.\n[2002-12-06 09:30:00] cafe | I heard my mother remark that little details were always different in a foreign land. She asked what I thought of Nils Nils and praised her as a lovely girl. I casually responded, 'Yeah, sure.'\n[2002-12-06 10:00:00] cafe | I knew Tonje had once been part of our family, and my family still held affection for her. I learned that my mother hadn’t hidden away those wedding photos and albums. I actually understood that my mother would surely like Nils Nils. But deep down, I sensed she and Henrik Inge probably still felt regret over Tonje’s departure.\n[2002-12-20 20:00:00] Bastu Street / street | I heard her ask me about my Christmas plans. I told her I’d be returning to Ålhus to stay with my mother, and she offered to come along. I heard us then erupt into a heated argument. I insisted it was still too early to bring her back home. I saw snowflakes swirling through the city sky. I saw white streets and rooftops, and felt how every movement had softened.\n[2002-12-20 22:00:00] Bishop's Crest Bar | I sat with her in the bar, silently drinking beer. Later, I handed her the plane ticket to Paris as a surprise. Then we went to the airport together. I learned that we were going to stay in Paris for a week. I wanted to use this trip to make up for our previous argument.\n[2002-12-28 19:00:00] Paris restaurant | I noticed that during dinner in Paris, the male waiter’s every move flustered me, while Nils Nils merely cast a contemptuous glance. I heard her shouting at me incessantly, accusing me of not loving her, not wanting her, insisting that nothing would ever come of us. I felt utterly desperate, realizing her anxiety had flared up and turned irrational. I asked myself inwardly what kind of situation I had gotten myself into, and where my life was heading. I thought about going shopping, but then abandoned the idea, thinking of her hatred for it and her fear of being alone.\n[2002-12-30 14:00:00] Eiffel Tower/Cemetery | I watched as we visited the Eiffel Tower together, then went to see one of Nils Nils’s girlfriends who lived in Paris. Afterward, we also paid our respects at the cemetery where Marcel Proust was buried. I sensed the Eiffel Tower exuding a strong nineteenth-century aura. I also noticed that although the day started well, Nils Nils’s mood would suddenly plunge into a black abyss.\n[2002-12-31 23:00:00] Paris restaurant/Seine riverside | I saw us walking into an elegant and cozy restaurant on New Year’s Eve, receiving a string of compliments. An hour after the new year began, I held Nils Nils’s hand and walked back to the hotel along the Seine riverside. The atmosphere in the restaurant was elegant and warm; the night along the Seine gave me a long-missed sense of peace. I remembered this restaurant had been recommended by my good friend Helen Sterne from Baysang. I felt that in this moment, we were glowing, as if we had returned to the beautiful days of the past.\n[2003-01-03 10:00:00] Paris airport | I realized that no matter how much stress the trip to Paris had caused her, as soon as we arrived at the airport to head home, the burden in my heart simply vanished.\n[2003-01-10 10:00:00] Warehouse/New office space | In early January, I moved all my books to a warehouse outside the city, cleaned the apartment, and returned the keys. Following Cora’s advice, I secured a shared workspace in a castle-like building atop a hill on the Slussen side, and began going there to work every day. I am on the top floor of the workspace, situated so high that the view extends over the hills of Slussen. I knew my landlady was selling the house. I learned that Nils Nils was helping me look for office space.\n[2003-01-15 09:00:00] Workspace | I tried writing over a hundred pages on a new document. I bought a cheap picture book and began writing a story about a shepherd boy secretly watching angels walk through the forest. I noticed three angels dressed in sixteenth-century clothing strolling through the Italian countryside in the picture book. I realized this was a new beginning—I had seized upon the theme of angels. Although I felt the story of angels living at the edge of human memory was traceable, I began to worry about where the story should go next.\n[2003-01-15 17:00:00] Workspace | I realized this angel story had nothing to do with me—it contained no traces of my own life. I felt unable to enter into it, let alone control it. I even mocked myself inwardly—since that was the case, why not just write 'Ghost and the Skull Cave'? I kept asking myself: where is the story?\n[2003-01-20 10:00:00] Workspace kitchen | I carried out meaningless work day after day in the workspace. I stood in the kitchen waiting for the coffee machine to finish. I noticed the man cleaning the toilet was a Black man. I heard myself accidentally use the word 'nigger,' and then heard one of my co-working partners immediately correct me on the spot. I learned that everyone in this shared writing space carried an overly abundant form of radical leftist kindness. I realized I had no choice but to continue this meaningless work. When I saw the janitor, I was so startled I couldn’t speak.\n[2003-01-25 09:00:00] Workspace | One morning when I arrived at the workspace, I saw police questioning people inside the building. I watched as everyone sat down to discuss the break-in. I heard my companions speculate it must have been an inside job. When I mentioned it might have been those drug addicts downstairs who stole the keys, I heard one of them say sternly, 'You can't say that.' I learned that two break-ins had occurred here, and computers and camera equipment had been stolen. Looking at his self-righteous expression, I felt deeply shocked. I realized that due to political correctness in language, they would rather cover reality with a net than face possible injustice and prejudice.\n[2003-01-25 10:00:00] office | I saw that group of drug users hanging around the stairwell all the time, and I was certain they'd do anything for money. I heard the other side argue that this was prejudice, insisting that drug users should be given a chance. I heard myself verbally admit uncertainty, yet inwardly I was deeply shocked. I knew those people indeed had criminal records. I realized this was exactly the Mochengdao society Karl Larsdal had once described to me. I felt this wasn't just prejudice—it was damn well the truth. Suddenly, I missed Karl in Baghdad terribly.\n[2003-02-10 10:00:00] Halvik | I remembered Jorgensen once telling me he would never go back to Leivik. I learned that Jorgensen was coming over by car. I knew he had written a novel, *Zalup*, which meant a great deal to me. I recalled the radical, uncompromising ideas in that book, and its unique linguistic style. I realized I absolutely loved that kind of singular, self-contained originality.\n[2003-02-15 00:00:00] Halvik | I knew that after living in Halvik for over half a year, everything had changed. I felt filled with resentment; the claustrophobia brought on by love made me long to leave. Yet I realized I was too weak—I couldn’t bear to leave her out of pity, and I knew deep down I still loved her.",

    "text": "[2003-02-20 13:00:00] Film Building/Café/Gnesta | I saw us sitting in the sunlight of the Film Building eating lunch, or talking endlessly in apartments and cafés. I followed her to her mother’s house in Gnesta, stepping into that quiet forest. I heard us discussing our lives, past and present, and the various people around us. I felt the sunlight in the Film Building was wonderfully warm. The forest exuded a hushed stillness. I felt Nils Nils pulling me out from my deeply buried inner world. I noticed that in the forest, she sometimes seemed like a fragile little girl. I realized all my feelings had become far more intense than before.\n[2003-02-23 19:00:00] Siv Ingrid's apartment | I took Nils Nils to Siv Ingrid’s thirtieth birthday party. I found a corner to sit, chatting with a peace organization leader and her engineer husband. I drank several bottles of beer, then found a bottle of aquavit and started guzzling it. I saw the one-room apartment in South Malmo packed with people, and felt the air growing somewhat stale as night fell. I felt the alcohol making me feel stronger. I realized that as I got drunker, the figures around me began to blur.\n[2003-02-23 23:00:00] Siv Ingrid's apartment/Street | I was very drunk, started crumpling napkins into balls and throwing them at people nearby. I rambled on incessantly, dumping every thought in my head. I watched as Nils Nils forcibly dragged me out. I tried to protest, but she pulled hard, and finally I stumbled outside, putting on my coat. I heard myself laughing uncontrollably, spouting what I thought were witty nonsense. I thought the atmosphere felt warm and cozy. I realized that although I’d tried hard to please everyone, I had clearly failed.\n[2003-02-23 23:10:00] South Malmo street | I walked along the streets of South Malmo, watching Nils Nils raging at me. I noticed that all the other twenty-odd guests had left completely sober. I heard her scolding me for humiliating her in front of her best friend, accusing me of having lost all self-control. I also heard myself confusedly asking what was going on—after all, I thought, it was just a party. I learned that Mochengdao’s party culture demanded that everyone leave as dignified as they arrived. I realized I was utterly out of step with their customs. I felt her deep embarrassment and dissatisfaction toward me.\n[2003-02-23 23:20:00] South Malmo street | I stared at Nils Nils, and my own temper exploded. I screamed at her and began cursing. I heard myself shrieking that she was utterly despicable, accusing her of trying to control me. I shouted, 'Now I’m leaving you, goddammit—you’ll never see me again!' I felt that due to drunkenness, I had no bottom line left inside. I just wanted to escape from this suffocating grip.\n[2003-02-23 23:30:00] lawn near Vesder station | I yanked my hand free from hers and ran off. I strode across the street straight toward Vesder station. I charged forward without looking back. I heard her running after me, urging me to talk tomorrow. I shouted back, 'I never want to see you again!' Her voice calling my name from outside the apartment echoed in my ears. I felt an extreme sense of finality; the alcohol made this anger unstoppable.\n[2003-02-24 04:00:00] Halvik Central Station | I crossed the old town, storming furiously toward the central station. I stared at the illegible letters on the bulletin board. I entered the station and found a bench deep inside, lying down on it. I felt snow falling outside, the cold biting through. I noticed the lights in the station wavering slightly in my vision. I learned there was a train to Bærleng around four in the morning. I knew it was now four o'clock. I told myself the plan was simple: take the train and leave, never come back. I felt the fire inside me even made me ignore the cold.\n[2003-02-24 04:10:00] Halvik Central Station bench | I lay down on the bench and slowly drifted off to sleep. My last thought was: when I wake up, I must not hesitate—I have to follow through with this decision to leave Halvik, no matter how sober I am by then.\n[2003-02-24 08:00:00] Halvik Central Station | I felt a security guard shaking my shoulder. I slowly sat up and finally got myself steady. I heard the guard say, 'You can't sleep here.' I replied that I was waiting for a train. Then I heard him suggest I go home, and I answered, 'Okay.' I noticed it was just past eight o'clock, and the station was already crowded with people.\n[2003-02-24 08:10:00] Subway/Vesder apartment door | I staggered into the subway passage and climbed into the carriage. I got off at Vesder station, returned to the apartment, and knocked on the door. I felt extremely heavy-headed, and everything in front of me was swaying. I noticed that all around me were streams of commuters. I realized I hadn't sobered up yet. Right now, my only thought was to find a place to sleep—nothing else mattered.\n[2003-02-24 08:30:00] Vesder apartment | Through the glass door, I saw Nils Nils running toward me. She opened her arms and hugged me. I pushed her aside and rushed into the room, stripped off my clothes, and crawled under the covers. I heard her say, 'Oh, you're back—I was so scared.' She asked me where I had gone. I answered that I went to the central station and had intended to take a train back to Leivik. I shouted at her, 'Leave me alone for a while—don't wake me up.' I could feel her fear inside, but right now I just wanted to escape reality and sleep.\n[2003-02-24 18:00:00] Vesder apartment | I slept the entire day. When I woke up, I saw Nils Nils sitting in the kitchen chair reading a book. I heard her say, 'Okay,' and ask what I'd like to eat after waking up. I noticed it was already completely dark outside. The desk lamp in the room was tilted, casting a soft glow over her.\n[2003-02-24 18:10:00] Vesder apartment kitchen | I walked into the kitchen, poured myself a glass of water, and drank it all in one go. I saw her put the book on the armrest and stand up. I heard her ask, 'Hey, how are you?' I replied, 'Fine, as long as I'm not angry.' Then I heard her apologize for last night, and I responded, 'Me too.'\n[2003-02-24 18:20:00] Vesder apartment living room | I refilled my cup with water and sat down at the table. I watched Nils Nils come over and turn on the ceiling light. I asked her if she remembered the first time we met in this room. I told her that when she said she 'liked' me, I felt offended because in Leivik language, 'like' sounds so weak. I explained that I really thought she only had slight feelings for me. I realized that the word 'like' in Mochengdao language means the same thing as 'love' in Leivik language.\n[2003-02-24 18:30:00] Vesder apartment living room | I asked her if she remembered our first meeting in this room. I told her that when she said she 'liked' me, I felt offended because in Leivik language, 'like' sounds so weak. I explained that I truly believed she only had a little affection for me. I realized that the word 'like' in Mochengdao language carries the same weight as 'love' in Leivik language.\n[2003-02-24 18:40:00] Vesder apartment living room | I saw her give me a faint smile, then lower her head and stare at the tabletop. I heard her tell me that she had summoned all her courage to confess to me, but my coldness afterward left her utterly disheartened when she walked away.\n[2003-02-24 18:50:00] Vesder apartment living room | I said to her, 'But we're here now.' I sternly told her she couldn't command me what to do, or else I would leave her. I emphasized this applied to drinking and everything else. I heard her whisper, 'I know.'\n[2003-02-24 19:00:00] Vesder apartment kitchen | I walked into the kitchen, poured the meatballs into the frying pan, and started boiling water for noodles. I noticed that Nils Nils had followed me into the kitchen. I asked her, \"We still have meatballs in the fridge, right? I'm starving.\" I heard the sound of butter melting in the hot pan. I felt a momentary sense of peace.\n[2003-02-24 19:10:00] Vesder apartment kitchen | I heard myself say, \"There was nothing wrong with that summer. I mean, about drinking. You didn't mind back then, did you?\" I also heard her reply, \"No, it was wonderful. I'm afraid of going too far now, but I wasn't then—not with you. I felt completely safe. I'd never felt that kind of security before, and now we've moved past that stage.\"\n[2003-02-24 19:20:00] Vesder apartment kitchen | I turned around as I spoke. I noticed the butter in the pan beginning to melt between the meatballs. I saw her shrug her shoulders. I heard myself ask, \"So what stage are we in now?\" I heard her respond that she didn't know either, only that it felt like something had been lost, that something had ended. She admitted she was afraid the rest might disappear too. I told her, \"But you can't force me. That would be the best way to make it vanish.\" She murmured softly, \"Of course. I know.\"\n[2003-02-24 19:30:00] Vesder apartment kitchen | I sprinkled salt into the pot of water for the pasta. I watched her nod, then noticed she wiped tears from her face with both thumbs. I asked her, \"Do you want to?\"",

    "text": "[2003-02-25 10:00:00] Halvik | I know this man has a strong personality—stubborn yet generous, flexible yet unyielding. As far as I know, he is coming to Halvik now to visit Nils Nils and me.\n[2003-02-25 14:00:00] Vesder apartment / antique bookshops / Pelican Restaurant | Around two o'clock the next day, I saw Jorgensen arrive. We browsed several antique bookshops together; I watched him examine old books on natural history. Then we went to the Pelican Restaurant for dinner and beer, staying until closing time. I felt his extraordinary presence fill the small apartment the moment he walked in.\n[2003-02-25 21:00:00] Pelican Restaurant | I heard myself tell him about spending the night at the station and my decision to take the train back to Leivik. I heard him exclaim in surprise, \"But I'm just arriving! Do I have to turn around and go back too?\" I also said to him, \"The moment I woke up, that's exactly what I thought: Jorgensen is coming. I can't fucking go home now.\"\n[2003-02-25 23:00:00] Pelican Restaurant | I watched him burst into loud laughter. That night I drank twenty bottles of beer. I noticed an old drunk sat down at our table and seemed to get along well with Jorgensen. I felt Jorgensen laughing and occasionally nudging my shoulder. I heard him recount his bloody love affair. I heard the old drunk repeatedly complimenting me, calling me handsome, saying I was a good-looking young man. I heard Jorgensen keep trying to coax the man into telling more about his life. I thought to myself that compared to his story, mine with Nils Nils was nothing but a midsummer comedy.\n[2003-02-26 02:00:00] Outside Vesder apartment | I remember us standing outside the apartment. I watched him climb into his little car and lie down on the back seat to sleep. I felt the gray, cold sky hanging over everything, saw light snowflakes swirling in the air.\n[2003-03-01 10:00:00] Vesder apartment | I knew that if we wanted children, we would need a larger apartment. I learned that Nils Nils’s mother had an empty flat downtown. As far as I knew, rental agreements in Mochengdao were personal property and valid for life, but we could arrange a lease exchange. I thought this one-bedroom apartment was our arena, narrow but sufficient for now—but I realized we needed to plan for future changes.\n[2003-03-15 14:00:00] Nils Nils's mother's apartment | One day, I watched as we went to see the apartment. Before me was the most bourgeois apartment I had ever seen. I saw a massive Russian marble fireplace at one end of the room, and the walls were adorned with intricately carved white paneling. I noticed the ceiling was over four meters high, and beneath my feet lay a beautiful herringbone parquet floor from the late nineteenth century. I also saw her mother’s heavy, aesthetically rich furniture from the late nineteenth century. I marveled inwardly—this was truly the most bourgeois apartment I had ever seen.\n[2003-03-15 14:30:00] Nils Nils's mother's apartment | I watched us moving around the apartment. I heard myself ask, 'Can we live here?' I heard Nils Nils reply firmly, 'No, certainly not.' She remarked to me how lifeless the place felt and suggested somewhere like Sjølyst instead. I heard myself agree, 'I agree—we simply couldn't live in a place like this.' I knew that Sjølyst was a suburban satellite town populated largely by immigrants. I recalled the diversity of Sjølyst's market and felt it had far more vitality than this place.\n[2003-03-15 15:00:00] Nils Nils's mother's apartment | I realized that the idea of moving in here was actually beginning to appeal to me. I remembered how I had always been drawn to the order and structure of middle-class life. Yet I also recalled that whenever I found myself in such environments, I would feel an inner resistance, as if the strange and distasteful parts of myself would be exposed.\n[2003-03-15 16:00:00] Nils Nils's mother's apartment | I watched as we lay on the bed, propped up on pillows, smoking. I imagined starting a new life here with her and our child. I pictured a new happiness in a new neighborhood, and this thought overshadowed my initial impression of the apartment's lifelessness. I felt a sudden surge of enthusiasm and no doubt that our new life would begin right here.\n[2003-04-25 19:00:00] Old Town American restaurant | In late April, I watched Karl Larsdal return from Iraq. We had dinner at an expensive American restaurant in the Old Town. I sensed he was extremely excited, radiating energy. I learned he spent weeks recounting his entire experience there, and gradually, even I became familiar with all the names he mentioned. I thought to myself, I had never seen him like this before.\n[2003-05-05 23:00:00] Vesder apartment | In early May, I watched Nils Nils and me moving in with Anders’s help. I saw her suddenly squat down, leaning against the wall, tears welling up in her eyes. I heard her scream, 'I can't take it! I'm done!' I heard myself urge her, 'Just one more hour, at most an hour and a half. You can make it.' I also heard her suggest calling her mom, saying we didn’t need to finish everything, and that her mother could come tomorrow to help. I understood she didn’t think it would be a problem for her mother to come help.\n[2003-05-05 23:10:00] Vesder apartment | I watched her grab a rag, stand up, and resume scrubbing the bathroom door frame. Then, I watched her get dressed and walk out into the night. I heard myself ask her, 'You're going to have someone else clean your house?' I scolded her, saying she couldn't call her mom every time something got tough. I heard myself say, 'I'll finish the rest—you go ahead. I'll come later.' I heard her ask in surprise, 'Really?' After I confirmed it, she said, 'Okay.'\n[2003-05-06 01:00:00] Vesder apartment | I finished the remaining cleaning alone. The next day, I began moving all my books. As far as I knew, my book collection had now grown to twenty-five hundred volumes. I told myself that cleaning wasn't really such a big deal for me.\n[2003-05-10 10:00:00] New apartment | I watched Anders and Karl Larsdal help me carry boxes into the elevator and the apartment. I started painting the walls. I heard them passionately cursing the moving task. I knew Nils Nils had gone to Leivik to do a radio program. As far as I knew, she would be staying with my mother, who they had only met once before. I thought about how Karl compared moving to unloading ammunition crates—a kind of physical labor that felt entirely unfamiliar to me.\n[2003-05-15 20:00:00] New apartment | After she boarded the train, I watched myself call my mother. I heard myself mention taking down the wedding photo and that album. I heard my mother refuse to hide the album, saying it represented a period of her life, and she assured me Nils Nils wouldn't mind. I heard myself reply, 'Alright, you're right—it's your album. I just don't want to hurt her.' I also heard my mother reassure me that everything would be fine. I knew my mother had already taken down the wedding photo after the marriage ended. I felt uneasy about the traces left by Toneje, and inwardly worried they might hurt Nils Nils.\n[2003-05-16 10:00:00] New apartment/Leivik Bålstad | I heard her describing the scenery of western Leivik over the phone, the sound of waves crashing. I heard myself tell her how cozy the big house felt now, how the rooms had been painted entirely white. I felt in my ears the dreamlike sensation of Leivik’s interwoven green, blue, and white that she described. I learned she had chosen to live with my mother, which I thought was a brave decision. I felt full of anticipation for the future. I imagined living together with her in our new home at the city center, and looked forward to the child we had decided to have.",

    "text": "[2003-05-16 19:00:00] New apartment/Restaurant | After hanging up, I continued painting the walls. The next afternoon, I saw Olaf Ingva and Erik come by. I took everyone out to dinner and introduced them to Karl Larsdal. I sensed something strange in the atmosphere at the dinner table; I saw Karl Larsdal shut his mouth tight after being challenged by Olaf Ingva. I knew my friends were attending a seminar. As far as I knew, the two of them didn’t get along very well. I felt torn between my two friends. I realized this social performance I put on to keep things pleasant left me feeling somehow insincere inside.\n[2003-05-17 10:00:00] Leivik Jølstadale Farm | I heard Nils Nils tell me she had gone with my mother to Dåle farm, where they met Sjøliug and Magne. She said the National Day celebration there felt exotic. I heard her mention seeing deer by the forest edge in the morning, and that my mother said the dolphins in the fjord were a lucky omen. I knew she had spent the whole day with my family.\n[2003-05-17 15:00:00] Leivik Jølst | I heard Nils Nils say she really liked my grandmother’s sister and her husband Anfin. I heard her describe Anfin talking passionately about whaling, and how they made pancakes with penguin eggs. She also expressed concern to me about the poor audio quality of recordings of Anfin’s dialect. I recalled hearing the sound of dolphins breaking the water from a small boat in the fjord, seeing their sleek, shiny dark gray bodies. I knew dolphins weren’t commonly seen there. I learned Anfin was lively and remarkably charming. From what I understood, people from Mochengdao might have difficulty understanding him due to his heavy dialect.\n[2003-05-18 20:00:00] New apartment | I watched Olaf Ingva leave. I shelved the last batch of books and threw away the remaining cardboard boxes. In the evening, Erik and I went out to eat, then came back and drank through the night. I read the text messages Nils Nils sent me. I read Nils Nils writing tenderly: 'Goodnight, my dear prince—maybe tomorrow will be a big day!' I knew Nils Nils was feeling unwell and exhausted. I understood she would be returning the next morning. As I read her increasingly passionate messages, I thought to myself that her feeling unwell might mean only one thing.\n[2003-05-19 07:00:00] New apartment | At seven in the morning, I watched myself go to bed. Though dazed, I still set the alarm for nine. I prepared to go pick up Nils Nils at the station. I felt the sharp burn of alcohol blazing inside me, so intense it nearly blinded me to everything around. I realized that even though I was completely drunk, a faint awareness remained—to go meet her.\n[2003-05-19 09:00:00] Street | At nine o’clock, I forced myself out of bed. I went into the bathroom and took a shower, changed into clean clothes. I shouted to Erik that I was leaving, then staggered down the stairs and out onto the street. I heard myself tell Erik we’d meet at the restaurant at twelve. I heard him reply with an acknowledgment. I felt the glaring sunlight, smelled the spring scent rising from the asphalt road. I felt drunk still—each step demanded all my willpower.\n[2003-05-19 09:10:00] Store/Street | I stopped to buy a bottle of cola, drank it, then bought another. I used the store window to look at my own face. I saw how terrible I looked—puffy eyelids, bloodshot eyes. I knew her train would arrive in thirteen minutes. I inwardly lamented how exhausted I appeared. I thought, if only I could delay the pickup by three hours, I’d do anything—but I knew that was impossible.\n[2003-05-19 09:20:00] Train station platform | I saw her appear on the platform, dragging her suitcase with one hand as she walked toward me. I waved and stepped forward to hug her, but I felt her pull away, then turn and walk off. I followed her silently down the platform. I heard myself say: 'Hey. I stayed up late yesterday, nothing serious.' I also heard her cold reply: 'You reek of alcohol. How could you do this to me? Did it have to be today?' I heard myself apologize, asking if it was really such a big deal, but got no answer. I saw her arrive radiant and light-footed. I felt how deeply repulsed she was by the smell of my hangover.\n[2003-05-19 09:30:00] Clara Hill Viaduct/Pharmacy | On the escalator, I listened as she kept berating me. I followed her to the pharmacy. At the second pharmacy that was open, I watched her buy a pregnancy test. Then I walked beside her across the street. I heard her raging the whole way. Her voice of disgust echoed in my ears—she said she didn’t understand why she should stay with me, accused me of thinking only of myself. She shouted at me: 'Didn’t our words yesterday mean anything at all?' I felt passersby turning to stare because of her shouting. I knew it was Sunday, and many pharmacies were closed. I understood we were walking along Kabinettsgata. I felt like a dog walking beside her.\n[2003-05-19 09:45:00] Cabinet Street | I walked beside her with my head down. I felt intense shame, guilt, and fear. I wanted to beg her to calm down, but realized she was justified, so I had to endure the scolding. I worried about being seen by someone I knew in this pitiful state, especially at the thought that Erik might be nearby.\n[2003-05-19 10:00:00] New Apartment | I walked up the stairs and into the apartment, standing in the center of the freshly painted floor, watching her enter without even glancing at me. Before me were freshly painted walls; the whole apartment looked neat and orderly. I felt her earlier anger like a violent beating. I sensed myself as an empty shell, drifting through her life.\n[2003-05-19 10:05:00] New Apartment | I was certain she was pregnant—I’d known it since the moment we made love. In my mind, I thought: Well, we’re going to have a child.\n[2003-05-19 10:10:00] New Apartment | I stood in the center of the floor, turned my back so she wouldn’t see my expression, then covered my face with both hands and burst into uncontrollable sobs, crying as I moved toward the hallway. I felt the floodgates inside me suddenly open, my defenses collapsing instantly. I thought it was a profound humiliation, feeling neither like a person nor a man.\n[2003-05-19 10:15:00] New Apartment | I heard her speaking behind me while I struggled to catch my breath between violent sobs. I heard her pleading behind me not to cry, saying she never meant it. I heard myself gasping out, 'Sorry, I didn't mean to.' Then I heard her say sorry too. The last thing I wanted was for her to see me cry, yet I couldn’t stop at all.\n[2003-05-19 10:20:00] New Apartment Bathroom | I went into the bathroom, breathing deeply, then splashed cold water on my face several times. Through tears, I laughed and said, 'Alright, same old routine.' I heard her respond with a smile too. I felt the wave of sobbing finally recede within me.\n[2003-05-19 10:30:00] New Apartment Kitchen | After leaving the bathroom, I saw her standing in the hallway and went forward to embrace her tightly. I watched her take the pregnancy test into the bathroom, and a while later, she came out and stood in the kitchen staring at the white stick. I heard her ask if I was feeling better, saying it was okay to cry. I heard myself ask if she wanted to do the test now, then pressed her in the kitchen whether anything had changed. I heard her tell me the result: 'It's positive.' I gazed into her wild, serious, dark eyes and realized our lives would change forever.\n[2003-06-10 15:00:00] New Apartment Backyard | I sat in the backyard smoking and called my brother Henrik Inge. I heard Nils Nils announce the good news to her mother, and heard her burst into joyful tears. I heard my mother praise it as good news on the phone, yet mutter that we weren’t prepared. I told Henrik Inge the due date was January, and he congratulated me. I learned that after three weeks of pregnancy, we decided to share the news with our families. I thought Mom always needs time to adjust herself and adapt to such huge changes.\n[2003-06-10 15:30:00] New Apartment Backyard | I lit a cigarette and sat in the backyard, gazing at the view before me, lost in thought. I found myself dissatisfied with how friends and family reacted. I realized that since moving to Mochengdao, I seemed to have grown distant from my family. I thought people often get trapped in mundane trivialities and struggle to immediately grasp life-changing events.",

    "text": "[2003-06-10 20:00:00] New Apartment | I crushed out the cigarette and went upstairs into the house. I watched Vidal installing the washing machine her mother had bought for us. I heard myself telling her that the family was actually very happy. I heard Henrik Inge promise over the phone to provide a stroller and all necessary baby clothes. I saw boxes of toys and bundles of baby clothes stacked around the house. I learned we could have everything we wanted for the baby. I knew her mother frequently visited, bringing meals and supplies. I saw her eyes glistening with tears of gratitude, and I felt comforted too.\n[2003-06-20 10:00:00] office | I went to the communal office in the castle every day, piling my desk with massive volumes on theology, angels, and the history of science, and began taking notes on paper. I knew Nils Nils was attending classes at the drama academy. As far as I was aware, I was then immersed in biographies of Augustine, Hobbes, Spengler, and Newton, trying to piece together the logic for my novel. Though I didn't yet know what my exact goal was, I was striving to find a way out from within these vast and complex systems of thought.\n[2003-06-25 00:00:00] new apartment | I realized that beneath Nils Nils's happiness lay a feeling as deep as an abyss. I thought she was both excited about the new life and deeply trapped in the fear of being unable to care for the child or possibly losing it. I felt that no matter what I did, I couldn't completely erase this inner unease from her heart.\n[2003-06-28 10:00:00] Aucity street | I dragged two heavy suitcases and took Nils Nils across various modes of transportation toward Leivik for vacation. I saw Arvid meeting us in Aucity. I heard myself telling Arvid about her pregnancy right then, explaining why she needed rest. I knew that at the end of June we had begun this journey back home. Arvid had originally been Henrik's friend, but I had interacted with him frequently as well.\n[2003-06-28 10:10:00] Aucity street/cabin | I watched Arvid drive us to our destination, then walked into the wooden cabin. I heard Arvid express joyful congratulations and suggest dropping us off to rest first, then coming back later by boat to pick us up. I heard myself thanking him. Before me stood a poorly conditioned log cabin. The moment I saw that shabby cabin, I regretted it. I had wanted to show her the beautiful side of my hometown, but the conditions here were truly unsatisfactory.\n[2003-06-28 16:00:00] sea near Hisøy | I stepped out of the cabin onto the pier and saw Arvid approaching across the sea in his small boat; I then boarded the vessel. I saw rows of little white houses on the rocks bathed in the faint red glow of the setting sun, surrounded by blue sea and sky. Then, I felt strong gusts of wind rising across the water. Sitting on the boat, I marveled at the beauty of the scenery. Yet I also realized that under the force of the wind, these familiar landscapes seemed to be falling apart, becoming unfamiliar and alien.\n[2003-06-28 18:00:00] garden on Hisøy | I accompanied her ashore and indoors, sitting down with relatives and friends around a garden table. Noticing Nils Nils seemed somewhat cold, I gently squeezed her forearm under the table and looked at her. Looking at her expressionless face, I was filled with anguish. I had hoped she would impress her friends with her brilliance, only to find her extremely silent and reserved, which left me deeply disappointed.\n[2003-06-28 20:00:00] garden on Hisøy | I kept asking myself: What is she thinking? Who upset her? I wanted to figure out whether someone present had provoked her, or if I had said something wrong earlier.\n[2003-06-28 20:30:00] at sea | I sat on the speeding boat, watching the bow violently crash into waves, sending up sprays of water. I saw Nils Nils beside me turn deathly pale. I heard her gritting her teeth and whispering fiercely at me: 'Tell him to slow down! This is too dangerous for me!' I felt the fresh sea breeze hitting my face, while noticing Arvid smiling as he sped forward full throttle. I knew she was only three months pregnant at this point. I realized she was in extreme fear and fury. Though I wanted to speak up, I worried that asking Arvid to slow down would make me look foolish.\n[2003-06-28 20:40:00] at sea | I straightened up and moved close to Arvid behind the steering wheel, then returned to sit beside Nils Nils, watching him give me a smile. I heard Nils Nils angrily scold me for not understanding the danger. I heard myself weakly comforting her with 'It's okay.' I also heard Arvid casually ask how she was doing, and I nodded back with a smile. I saw Meldøya rapidly rushing toward us. I found that the words 'ask him to slow down' rose to my lips but were swallowed again—I ultimately didn't dare to speak them.\n[2003-06-28 21:30:00] Meldøya/dock | After walking around the island, I returned to the dock and quietly approached Arvid. I whispered to Arvid, explaining that Nils Nils had been a bit frightened due to her pregnancy, and asked him, 'Could you go a bit easier on the way back?' We had coffee and pastries on a carpet in Meldøya.\n[2003-06-28 22:00:00] at sea | I heard Arvid reply cheerfully, 'No problem.' Then I saw him steer the boat back to our destination at a snail's pace. I felt deeply embarrassed inside. I realized I had failed both to protect her feelings on the way there and then created this slightly ridiculous 'extra consideration' on the return—my handling of it all felt clumsy.\n[2003-06-28 23:00:00] Leivik | I knew she had just come out of a psychiatric hospital three years ago. As far as I knew, her history of bipolar disorder made this pregnancy somewhat risky. I worried in my heart whether she might relapse, but looking at her now, I believed she was healthy. I told myself that as long as we got through this crisis, everything would gradually fall into place.\n[2003-07-01 10:00:00] Moss Station / Rakolen | I took her by train to Moss, where Olaf Ingva picked us up and brought us home. I watched Nils Nils go off to rest first, then walked with Olaf Ingva to a nearby field to kick a ball around for a while.\n[2003-07-02 10:00:00] Jeløy Island cabin | The next day, I watched Olaf Ingva drive us to a wooden cabin on Jeløy Island. I knew we planned to stay there for a week.\n[2003-07-03 05:00:00] Jeløy Island cabin | I got up to write every day around five. Around ten, I watched her get up, and then we went swimming at the beach or shopping together. In the afternoons I went fishing alone, and in the evenings I lit a bonfire with her, chatting and reading. I noticed the novel about crab fishing was slowly taking shape. When I heard her praise what I'd just written as excellent, I felt deeply fulfilled inside.\n[2003-07-09 10:00:00] Bergen / Flåm / Balestrand / Fjærland | I took her across various modes of transport, finally boarding a ferry to Fjærland, where I saw Mom standing on the dock waiting for us. Before me lay glaciers in shades of gray-white under a blue sky. I felt the heaviness of passing through long tunnels and dark valleys, until the gentle, fertile countryside of Jølster came into view. I learned that along the way we had unexpectedly met Thomas Bra, who was hiking. I felt incredibly excited seeing Thomas Bra after so many years. I thought he was one of the finest people I’d ever known.\n[2003-07-10 10:00:00] Mother's house in Jølster | I sat in the garden, watching the interaction between Nils Nils and my mom. I heard Nils Nils initiate conversation with Mom, and saw Mom listening attentively to her. I knew this was their third meeting. I keenly sensed the distance between them. When I saw them begin to try communicating, a brief joy rose in my heart—only to be quickly replaced by worry over how it might end, hoping they would stop before things went too far.\n[2003-07-12 10:00:00] Mother's house in Jølster | I stayed by her side as she consulted a midwife over the phone. I heard Nils Nils say in panic that she was bleeding and wanted to leave immediately. I heard myself keep telling her, 'It'll be fine, it will definitely be fine.' I could feel her inner panic, though I wasn't sure myself. I carried immense pressure in my heart, fearing that if we stayed and something really went wrong, it would all be my fault.\n[2003-07-13 10:00:00] Mother's house in Jølster | I saw Nils Nils sink into silence all day, drifting like a ghost through the house. I went over and held her tightly, trying to calm her down. I sensed she was filled with fear, and that she felt I was indifferent to her pain—this had caused some resentment toward me. I could feel she didn’t want to stay here even a moment longer.",

    "text": "[2003-07-15 12:00:00] Florø Island restaurant | I accompanied her on a tour through the canyon, then sat with her at a table in the floating barge restaurant. I watched her remain nearly silent in response to my mother’s questions. I heard us shouting angrily at each other during the hike. I heard the waiter say the soup was fine—it was just supposed to taste that way. I smelled the spoiled flavor in the fish soup caused by too much butter. I was inside a restaurant on a barge at Florø Island. I felt this was truly an exhausting nightmare.\n[2003-07-15 12:30:00] Florø Island Restaurant | I looked at the bowl of fish soup in front of me and couldn't bring myself to lift my spoon. I heard Nils Nils complain that he couldn't eat the soup. I heard myself say to the waitress, 'This doesn't taste very good—do you think we could order something else?' I felt it was extremely embarrassing to complain about food in such a public setting.\n[2003-07-15 12:35:00] Florø Island Restaurant | I saw the strong middle-aged waitress shoot me an accusing glance, and then the three of us sat silently at the table, staring at our bowls of fish soup. I heard the waitress say, 'The food shouldn't be a problem, but since you've mentioned it, I'll go check with the cook.' I noticed the waitress had poorly dyed blonde hair.\n[2003-07-15 12:40:00] Florø Island Restaurant/Kitchen | I got up and walked into the kitchen built on land, leaned over the counter and stretched my neck trying to get someone's attention, then walked back to the barge. I said to the cook, 'We ordered fish soup, but there's too much butter in it—it's practically inedible. Do you think we could get something else instead?' I heard the cook reply stiffly, 'That's just how it tastes. You ordered fish soup, and we served you fish soup. There's nothing we can do about it.' I saw the cook was a tall, burly man, about my age.\n[2003-07-15 12:50:00] Florø Island Restaurant | I returned to our table and shook my head; then we stood up, left money on the table, and walked out the door. I heard myself say, 'No use.' I heard my mother suggest she try going in, but I stopped her. Finally, I heard myself say, 'Alright, alright, I'm hungry, but now this soup is completely impossible to eat.' I felt that complaining in a restaurant went against my nature and made me deeply embarrassed.\n[2003-07-15 14:00:00] On the boat | I carried the luggage onto the boat, waved goodbye to my mother, then sat at the bow eating a poor-quality pizza and potato pancake. I saw Nils Nils lie down and fall asleep; when she woke up, I watched her sit beside me and chatter endlessly. I said to Nils Nils, 'Let's eat on the boat.' I heard her quietly nod. I heard the sound of the boat’s propeller still spinning, and I felt the soggy, mushy texture of the pizza and potato pancake. I looked in surprise at how cheerful and lively she became after waking up—could the earlier gloom have been because of my mother, the unfamiliar environment, or fear for the baby?\n[2003-07-16 10:00:00] Halvik Hospital | I brought her home from Baysang by plane and accompanied her to the check-up the next day. I knew the test results showed everything was perfectly normal—the little heart was beating, everything was flawless.\n[2003-08-15 10:00:00] Akselhof Office | After the check-up, we went to a cake shop, then I took the subway to Akselhof’s new office to work. I sat among concrete walls writing, reading, watching the subway pass through the forest. I heard us talking together about the details of the examination. I was in a modest room located in the basement of an apartment building. I saw the subway tilt through the woods every five minutes or so; in the afternoon, the cars looked like rows of lit rooms moving through the trees. I knew this office space was provided for me by Sofivik. I realized the discussion in the book I was reading, *The Decline of the West*, regarding theories of civilization and the Baroque period, was deeply inspiring to me. I realized this novel must center on the seventeenth century; whenever my hypothetical framework gained new supporting arguments, I felt an uncontrollable joy.\n[2003-08-15 10:00:00] New Apartment | I watched Nils Nils’ belly grow larger each day, watched her busy herself organizing baby supplies. One morning I spilled water and left without cleaning it; when I came back, I found the carpet ruined, so we threw it away. I asked her what happened to the carpet. I heard her sheepishly explain that she’d been furious about the water stain I left, so she poured juice over it. I saw a large yellow stain on the kitchen carpet. I knew she now spent all day arranging baby clothes and studying pregnancy books. I was happy to see her enthusiasm for baby-related matters, but also realized I couldn’t fully share her feelings due to my need to write. I noticed anger flaring up between us from time to time.\n[2003-11-05 20:00:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I saw her suddenly pick up a pen and forcefully stab it into the dining table, scratching and carving again and again. I asked her, 'What are you doing?' I heard her say sorrowfully, 'You don't care.' I snapped back angrily, 'Oh, for God’s sake! Of course I care. Now you’ve ruined the table.' I knew this dining set was a precious gift from her mother. I understood her anger stemmed from my lack of appreciation for the letter she had written to the maternity clinic.\n[2003-11-10 21:00:00] New Apartment | I hurled a glass with all my strength against the stove. I felt furious at him. Seeing the glass didn’t break, I inwardly lamented how much of a failure I was—even failing at something as simple as smashing a glass.\n[2003-11-15 10:00:00] New Apartment | I went with her to IKEA to buy a diaper changing table, stuffed it full of cloth and towels, and pasted a series of postcards on the wall above it. I saw postcards of seals, whales, monkeys, and the Beatles pinned to the wall. I hoped that when the baby was born, she would see herself in a wonderful world.\n[2003-11-20 19:00:00] Prenatal Class Room | I accompanied her to the prenatal class, looked around the crowded classroom, and saw a woman crying on a bench. I heard the word 'instinct' from the podium, then heard angry murmurs from women in the room: 'No, no, no! How can you say such a thing!' I knew the crying woman was upset because her husband was late. I watched the woman's husband being beaten and felt inwardly that I wasn't alone—everyone was caught in this chaos caused by physical and psychological stress.\n[2003-11-20 20:00:00] New Apartment | I accepted the baby supplies sent by Henrik Inge and Marivik Lund, then called Henrik to check on the progress of the stroller. I heard Henrik say the stroller was almost ready. I heard myself mumble an excuse about how pregnant women are irrational for pushing so hard. I learned that Nils Nils was deeply distressed because he hadn’t yet received the stroller promised by his brother. I hated myself for having to go against my nature and pressure someone, but I told myself I had to endure these petty matters to calm her down.\n[2003-12-01 09:00:00] Prenatal Class Room / Subway / Aker Brygge | I saw the late man get punched in the stomach by his wife. Every morning I took the subway to Aker Brygge, walked to the office building to work, watching suburban houses and bridges flash by outside the train window. I smelled the distinctive air of the underground station. I saw the scenery rush past as the subway emerged from underground, and felt the view open up as the train crossed the bridge. I found that once I went underground, all the worries at home vanished. I deeply loved those little stops, enjoying the psychological isolation this commute brought.",

    "text": "[2003-12-01 10:00:00] New Apartment | I watched as the stroller still didn’t arrive. Later we bought a bath set, a onesie, and tiny shoes. I looked at the crib and down comforter lent to us by Helene. I learned that the delay with the stroller triggered another emotional outburst. I saw Nils Nils glisten with tears looking at the borrowed crib, sensing the waves of her emotions.\n[2003-12-05 21:00:00] New Apartment | I heard Nils Nils suggest naming the girl Vanya. We agreed that if it was a boy, we’d name him Bjørn. I learned that 'Vanya' originated from 'Ivan,' and also corresponded to Nils Nils’s father’s name, 'Johannes'. I really liked the suggestion—I thought the name carried a strong, wild feeling.\n[2003-12-10 08:30:00] Mochengdao Road Station | At Mochengdao Road Station, I saw two men fiercely arguing and throwing punches. I dropped my backpack, rushed over, and tightly grabbed one of them. Then I picked up my bag and sat on the train to Aker Brygge, feeling my knees trembling. I felt the subway station filled with terrifying aggression. I thought of previous conflicts where I had failed to act in time. I told myself today I had to take a stand—no more standing by. Though afterward my heart raced and I doubted whether it was wise, I was glad I proved I wasn’t a coward.\n[2003-12-12 00:00:00] New Apartment | I realized we were both close and distant. I noticed I held grudges more than she did, remembering every single argument from the past year. I sensed she clung to me desperately out of fear of losing me, while my withdrawal deepened her anxiety. But I was certain that once the child was born, everything would be fine.\n[2003-12-15 10:00:00] Aker Brygge / Maternity Care Center | I kept expanding the manuscript, passed by and visited a Russian Orthodox bookstore. I accompanied Nils Nils to the care center for her checkup, sitting in a chair watching her undergo various tests. I saw nurses measuring her blood pressure, drawing blood, listening to the heartbeat, and measuring her belly circumference. I learned the novel was turning toward theological theory. I knew the test results showed the fetus was developing perfectly normally. Whenever I found new arguments, I felt joyous. I felt concerns about physical strength were like passing clouds—utterly insignificant.\n[2003-12-15 14:00:00] New Apartment | I watched Henrik Inge arrive with the children, bringing the stroller. I noticed Nils Nils looked terrible, so I stepped in, trying to calm both sides. I felt a hostile atmosphere spreading through the room. I felt this oppressive mood would drive me mad, and I didn’t want the guests to suffer along with us.\n[2003-12-15 20:00:00] Harvik Bar | I sat silently across from him on the high stools at the bar. Two weeks later, I received a call from Kristina. I heard Kristina say he had gone to Turkey for field reporting and would be away for several months. I knew that the winter a year earlier, our atmosphere had been tense, and conversations often included sharp remarks about either him or my family. I felt somewhat offended that he hadn't mentioned a word to me before leaving.\n[2003-12-17 10:00:00] New Apartment | I said nothing, swallowed my reproach, and suppressed my inner anger. I knew her due date was approaching and she wanted peace. I didn’t understand why she would provoke conflict in front of guests; I felt this coldness toward visitors was disrespectful to me. I lamented her inability to control her temper, while I had to endure it all in silence just to keep things together.\n[2003-12-25 10:00:00] New Apartment | I watched Henrik and the children leave, and instead of punishing her with silent treatment, I let it go. I noticed she became cheerful and excited as soon as the guests left. I decided not to dwell on the earlier absurdity and let us have a pleasant time during Christmas.\n[2003-12-31 20:00:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | On the last day of 2003, I was busy moving around in the kitchen. I watched Karl Larsdal sit in his chair chatting with me. I knew my current life bore no trace of the Baysang period. I realized I had always been influenced by Karl, even easily swayed by him in changing my opinions. I remembered how my family once warned me not to pick up bad habits from him.\n[2003-12-31 20:15:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | I plated the lobster and wiped sweat from my forehead. I cut the lemon into four pieces and plucked some parsley leaves for garnish. I said to Karl, 'Done—just the side dishes left.' I heard Karl say, 'People know what you are, right? A writer’s life should be exciting, yet here you are scrubbing and cooking.' I replied, 'True, but look—it’s wonderful!'\n[2003-12-31 20:25:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | I burst out laughing at Karl’s words. I heard Karl mockingly say Bergson was the most depressing figure in Leivik literature because he not only never went out, but eventually killed himself. His infectious laughter rang in my ears.\n[2003-12-31 20:35:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | I heard Karl continue teasing, saying Ibsen was also a downer, even though he hid mirrors in his hat. He mentioned that Bjørnson and Hamsun weren’t depressing. He suggested classifying Leivik literature. I thought, if we really did this classification, the result might turn out unpleasant.\n[2003-12-31 20:45:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | I took bread from a paper bag, rinsed the knife under water, and began slicing it. I heard Karl suggest I write that article about Astridvik as soon as possible. I said I would write it later. I mentioned how he would destroy furniture when insane and lie naked in the coal cellar. I knew I had tentatively titled that article 'The Villain of Hardanger'.\n[2003-12-31 20:55:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | I heard Karl remind me that the writer had also written Hitler was a great man. I mentioned that the most meaningful entries in the diary were those written during his manic episodes, when his inhibitions vanished and he expressed genuine opinions about other writers. I remarked that no one had ever written about such a stark contrast.\n[2003-12-31 21:05:00] Kitchen of the New Apartment | I placed the sliced bread into a small basket and started cutting another loaf. I heard Karl say no one dared write about those contrasts because everyone feared his reputation. I explained it was out of a certain tolerance and politeness. When I heard Karl ask if I didn’t understand the poet, I disagreed. I felt a twinge of guilt over having laughed at Bergson earlier.\n[2003-12-31 21:15:00] kitchen of the new apartment | I heard Karl question my view of poets as wise men. I countered by asking him whether, if we only consider poetry itself, would a poet’s eccentric beliefs or crude remarks really affect his standing? I asked where exactly the boundary lies.\n[2003-12-31 21:25:00] kitchen of the new apartment | I heard Karl Larsdal laughingly refute me, saying there was no way I could be that sensitive and cautious, especially since the writer was already dead. He mentioned that the image of Høygrd as the \"Hardanger sage\" must be questioned—if he had been mad throughout long cycles, then the so-called wisdom couldn't hold. I also heard myself explain that perhaps I felt a bit guilty inside because I had just made fun of Bergson. I realized I was caught in complex emotions—on one hand drawn to the tragic life of Høygrd, on the other hand reflecting on whether my judgment of him was fair.\n[2003-12-31 21:35:00] kitchen of the new apartment | I finished slicing the last few pieces of bread and placed them into the small basket, then smiled at Karl Larsdal. I heard myself say to Karl, 'That's enough—help me carry the bread basket, butter, and mayonnaise; let's go join the others.' I heard Karl continue laughing and teasing that Bergson wasn't a party animal, just a crane operator. Though I was smiling, I still felt somewhat uneasy inside.",

    "text": "[2003-12-31 21:45:00] living room/dining area of the new apartment | I put the dishes on the table, emptied the remaining champagne, and opened another bottle of white wine. I sat down and used the seafood utensils gifted by Marivik and Tove to crack open the lobster claw. I heard Helene exclaim, 'Oh, wonderful!' and Nils Nils praise me for doing well. I responded, 'Please, help yourselves.' The lobster meat looked thick and delicious; when peeled, I noticed brine seeping from the gap between the meat and shell. Looking at the lobster in my hands, a strange thought crossed my mind: what must it have been like when this lobster wandered along the seabed?\n[2003-12-31 21:55:00] dining area of the new apartment | I raised my glass and saw everyone follow suit, lifting their glasses together. I heard myself loudly say in the Leivik dialect, 'Gathered here together, everyone!' I heard Karl Larsdal quietly mutter 'Skål,' and Anders loudly thank me: 'Skål! Thank you for having us!' I noticed Karl’s reaction to my dialect, while the others clearly didn’t mind this small linguistic gap.\n[2003-12-31 22:05:00] dining area/kitchen of the new apartment | I hid in the kitchen, peeking through the door crack to greet everyone before retreating back inside to keep busy. I began clearing the finished appetizers and preparing the next course. I realized that taking on the role of cook was actually my way of finding a refuge in this social gathering. I liked using the busyness of refilling glasses to hide my discomfort in conversation.\n[2003-12-31 22:15:00] dining area of the new apartment | I watched my companions around the table: Karl was deep in animated conversation with Anders, Helene was laughing loudly, while Kristina remained in prolonged silence. I heard the laughter from Karl and Anders talking about their criminal acquaintances, and Helene’s breathy laughter triggered by Karl’s candor. I sensed a complex tension flowing through the table. I realized I couldn’t engage deeply with Anders or Helene, and I noticed Helene’s subtle disapproval of Anders’ remarks. Watching silent Kristina, I wondered if her unhappiness had anything to do with us or with Karl—this uncertainty in social dynamics made me feel increasingly pressured.\n[2003-12-31 22:30:00] dining area of the new apartment | I speared a large bite of lobster meat, dipped it in mayonnaise, and put it into my mouth. I saw the windowpanes vibrate from sounds outside. I savored the thick, smooth texture of the lobster meat. Suddenly, a loud bang erupted outside, like an explosion, making the windowpanes rattle violently. I realized we were in a moment of delicate openness—as if on this New Year’s Eve, anyone could speak of any past without fear of losing anything.\n[2003-12-31 22:35:00] dining area of the new apartment | I heard Anders say, 'That kind of thing isn’t legal.' I heard Karl mock him as an expert in such matters. I heard Helene describe the Chinese balloon they’d bought, saying it rose silently and beautifully. I also heard Nils Nils worry it might land on the roof and start a fire, while Anders casually replied, 'Anything can happen on New Year’s Eve.'\n[2003-12-31 22:45:00] dining area of the new apartment | I got up and poured another round of drinks for everyone, exchanging a glance with Helene. I saw Karl Larsdal talking passionately. I sat in my chair watching Nils Nils. A brief silence fell over the room. Suddenly, a childhood memory flashed through my mind—the dangerous time when I and my friends secretly ignited powder from cartridge casings. I could even see Karlsen’s face blackened by smoke. But in the end, I decided not to tell that story. I saw Helene smiling warmly, while Karl began again on the differences between Mochengdao and Leivik.\n[2003-12-31 22:55:00] new apartment dining room | I heard Anders complain that Mochengdao was lifeless, cold, and run-down, and demand to know what kept everyone here. I also heard Helena reveal Anders’s desire to return to Spain. I heard Nils Nils curiously ask about Spain.\n[2003-12-31 23:05:00] new apartment dining room | I watched Anders spread his arms wide in gesture. He cast an expectant look toward me. I heard Anders passionately praise Spain's freedom and its enchanting cities, and suggest he'd take me to see Real Madrid and Barcelona matches. I heard myself reply, 'Sounds nice.' He grunted in dissatisfaction and shouted loudly, 'Let's go! Man!'\n[2003-12-31 23:15:00] new apartment dining room | I saw Nils Nils give me an encouraging smile, but I could read the anxiety behind it. I realized her deep-seated desire to control everything. I thought of the child soon to be born, sensing a profound change taking place within her—a quietness and silence like roots growing downward into soil.\n[2003-12-31 23:25:00] new apartment dining room | I leaned over to refill Anders’s glass with wine, then poured one for myself. I heard myself ask when exactly the matches would be, and heard Anders say we could attend any game. I heard someone suggest waiting a week after the baby is born before leaving; Anders joked that we weren't men from the 1950s pacing the hallway, and Karl laughed, jokingly calling himself just such an old-fashioned man.\n[2003-12-31 23:35:00] new apartment dining room/kitchen | I gathered up the plates and walked into the kitchen. I heard Kristina follow me in. I turned on the tap to rinse the knives, then placed two cast-iron pots on the stove and cranked the burners to high. I pushed open the window and heard the noise of people passing below. I heard myself ask if everyone had eaten well. I heard Kristina kindly offer, 'Can I help you with anything?' I shook my head quietly and said no. I also heard bursts of laughter coming from the living room. Fireworks outside hissed and exploded one after another, flashes intermittently lighting up the night sky. I felt Kristina’s kindness, but I instinctively looked down and avoided meeting her eyes.\n[2003-12-31 23:45:00] new apartment kitchen/living room | I poured white wine into the hot pan, sprinkled in parsley, then dumped the pasta into a colander. I walked into the living room and slipped a CD by the band Low into the player. I stepped behind Nils Nils and rested my hands on her shoulders. I heard Anders say he’d never ask me if I needed help. I also heard Helena ask with concern if I needed assistance, and I smiled and said no. I heard Nils Nils say gently to me, 'That’s nice.' Oil sizzled in the pans, and the air filled with the aroma of mussels and white wine. Music flowed through the room, mingling with the background hum of conversation and laughter.\n[2003-12-31 23:55:00] new apartment living room | I stood in the living room listening to Nils Nils tell a story. I heard Nils Nils recount a strange tale about a woman who kept a red-tailed boa: one day, the snake stretched out straight and lay beside her on the bed. I heard her repeat what an expert at Skansen Park said—the snake was measuring its prey, assessing whether it could swallow the owner whole. As I listened, a chill ran through me.\n[2004-01-01 00:05:00] new apartment living room/kitchen | I let out a startled cry and heard everyone burst into laughter. I saw Karl explaining regional dialect words for snakes to the others, and I took the chance to turn and head back to the kitchen. I heard myself exclaim, 'Oh God! That’s the most disgusting story I’ve ever heard!' I heard Nils Nils expose my secret fear of snakes and mimic my delirious midnight rambling about stepping on one. I heard myself retort, 'When you talk about bugs, as if they’re not dangerous or something!' I didn’t want to hear the Freudian psychological analysis that would surely follow—I just wanted to get out of the living room quickly.",

    "text": "[2004-01-01 00:15:00] new apartment kitchen | I dropped the pasta into boiling water and sliced garlic into the hot pans. I scooped mussels from the sink and tossed them into the pots, then covered them with lids. Next, I poured in white wine and sprinkled parsley on top. The crackling of oil in hot pans blended with the roaring of boiling water. I could feel the scent of garlic and herbs spreading through the kitchen.\n[2004-01-01 00:25:00] new apartment dining room | I carried the plate into the dining room and saw everyone’s expectant expressions. I picked up a mussel shell, used my fork to dig out the meat with orange streaks, and took a bite. I heard Helena exclaim, 'Wow, amazing!' I heard Nils Nils praise me for doing well. I also heard Anders half-jokingly challenge, 'Is there anything you can’t do?' I heard myself explain it was just a simple recipe taken from Jamie Oliver. I heard the crunch of fine sand between my teeth as I chewed the mussel. I kept my head down, focusing on the food in my plate to avoid Anders’s teasing.\n[2004-01-01 00:35:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I lifted my head from the plate and looked at Anders. I heard myself ask Nils Nils whether she had ever told about the salted mutton ribs feast. I explained to everyone this traditional Leivik Christmas dish, mentioning the lamb ribs my mother had sent. I recounted the awkward story of how I spent that afternoon steaming the meat, only for it to remain uncooked until late at night before finally being ready. I knew this salted mutton ribs required months of curing and air-drying, a specialty from my hometown. Remembering that Christmas Eve filled with the smell of mutton, yet ending with us going to bed without properly eating, I couldn't help but find it somewhat funny.\n[2004-01-01 00:45:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I watched Nils Nils cheerfully adding details to the story for everyone. I heard Nils Nils laughingly complain that I woke her up at one in the morning to eat the meat. She sighed, 'It didn’t look like much, but it was actually pretty good.' I heard Anders comment that this was truly a 'pastoral' kind of story, unlike my usual tales of things going wrong. I felt a warm sense of camaraderie, even though it had been a less-than-successful dinner attempt.\n[2004-01-01 00:55:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I looked at Anders, listening to him talk about his past life. I heard Anders jokingly refer to himself as 'a former rich man.' He described his extravagant past running a restaurant in Spain, owning luxury cars and fine horses, and then how he went bankrupt and ended up in prison due to fraud by a business partner, leaving him with massive debts. I heard him insist he hadn’t complained like we did. I was struck by Anders’ extreme experiences and his remarkably calm, accepting tone.\n[2004-01-01 01:05:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Helene challenge Anders, saying he simply didn’t want to understand where he was. Helene lamented that while she envied Anders’ 'not thinking,' she herself always struggled hard to figure out who she was and why she had gone through those experiences. Anders shot back, teasing that they were always sitting on the couch complaining about their feelings. I realized there was a fundamental difference in how the two approached life.\n[2004-01-01 01:15:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Karl Larsdal point out that Helene’s story wasn’t so different. Helene admitted that although she once starred at the Royal Theatre, leaving everything behind at her peak to move to Hawaii had not exactly been a wise career move. But I heard her say firmly, 'I followed my feelings—there’s nothing to regret.' I knew Helene had once married a New Age movement leader and moved to Hawaii.\n[2004-01-01 01:25:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I looked at Kristina, listening as she began to share her story. I heard Anders encourage Kristina to speak. I heard Kristina describe how she was named best designer at a young age, exhibiting in Shannest and Paris. She regretfully mentioned that her success lacked foundation, which eventually led to bankruptcy. I sensed a quiet detachment in her voice toward that past glory.\n[2004-01-01 01:35:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Karl elaborate on Kristina’s former fame: TV crews coming to her home, her face displayed at the Cultural Palace, major newspapers dedicating six-page features to her. I heard Kristina shrug and calmly say she couldn’t earn money anymore and had already gone bankrupt. I could imagine the intense contrast of falling from such heights.\n[2004-01-01 01:45:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Karl vividly recount the disastrous final exhibition of Kristina’s: she rented a giant Sydney Opera House tent in Ladegårdsparken, had models ride into the show on guards’ horses. But just as everything reached its most spectacular moment, a heavy downpour began. I heard Kristina cover her mouth and burst into laughter. I too felt a sense of absurd humor rising from their storytelling.\n[2004-01-01 01:55:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Karl continue describing the models, drenched and disheveled, wolfing down food in the rain, calling it a 'glorious failure.' He explained that this was why, when I first met Kristina, she was designing shoes—the old-style pair she had worn during the exhibition, which later became popular, was her last small compensation for those lost dreams. I recalled the moment I first saw her, finally understanding the deeper meaning behind those details.\n[2004-01-01 02:05:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I gazed at Nils Nils, listening as she shared her unremarkable path to modest success. I heard Nils Nils talk about the joy after her debut work was published, and the regret of missing a trip to Japan to receive an award due to illness. She mentioned writing several poetry collections, only to be accepted and then rejected by two publishers in turn. She said, 'I told everyone about it… then later he said it wouldn’t be published after all.' I felt the blow of that 'false hope' she’d experienced, yet also saw how she could now say lightly, 'It’s no big deal.'\n[2004-01-01 02:15:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I heard Karl ask if he also counted as a 'beautiful failure.' He told how he had once been an academic prodigy, but his publication was blocked because he wrote his fieldwork on Mochengdao in Leivik and refused to provide sociological excuses for boxers' behavior. He joked that the book he self-published went unnoticed, except for one woman at the publisher who read it on a ferry and curiously studied the cover. He sighed, 'I don't think anyone would want to read the book I spent five years writing.'\n[2004-01-01 02:25:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I heard Anders regretfully tell Karl he should have given him a heads-up so he could arrange a TV appearance for him. I overheard Helena asking Karl how he’d respond if he actually received such an irresistible invitation. I heard Karl reply that although Anders didn’t have strong connections, he still appreciated the offer.\n[2004-01-01 02:35:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I saw Anders staring at me. I recalled my writing state over these past five years. I heard Anders say it was now my turn to speak. Karl remarked that I didn’t know how lucky I was. I told them I hadn’t achieved anything—I’d been writing for four years with no results. I heard myself mimic journalists’ tones, talking about writers with writer’s block or those who only ever wrote one book. I knew it had been nearly five years since I published my debut work.\n[2004-01-01 02:45:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I saw Karl glance at me, then burst into laughter. I listened as he told stories about his friends. I heard Karl insist that I didn’t know how lucky I was. He began listing his failed friends: one who tried online dating but was too poor to do anything but roast sausages over a campfire; another who spent all his savings on breast implants for a prostitute; someone else who had been working on his doctoral thesis for fourteen years with no end in sight. I heard him mention an Aucity friend who got a thirteen-year-old girl pregnant.\n[2004-01-01 02:55:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I saw Karl continuing to talk about his painter friend. I made eye contact with Nils Nils, and I smiled at her. I heard Karl make a point of clarifying that the man who got the girl pregnant wasn’t me. He sighed that we were all sitting on the same sinking, broken boat. I heard Nils Nils say Karl’s words were poetic, but that wasn’t how she felt right now. I saw Nils Nils sitting there with her arms wrapped around her swollen belly. I inwardly sighed—there would be a child in the house in just two weeks. I realized I was truly going to be a father.\n[2004-01-01 03:05:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I saw the table fall into silence. I stood up, took the wine bottle, and poured drinks for everyone. I saw Anders leaning back in his chair, holding his glass. I heard Helena remark how unusually honest we all remained. I joked that this was turning into a misery contest. I heard Karl shout loudly that he was the most miserable of all.\n[2004-01-01 03:15:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I saw Helen's face twitch slightly as she spoke, mimicking the mannerisms of her stepmother. I heard Helena say our parents could never talk as openly as we do. She described her father as the 'wig king,' and revealed that both her biological mother and stepmother were alcoholics. I knew Helena’s father made wigs. I understood her biological mother had become unbearable due to her drinking.\n[2004-01-01 03:25:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I saw Helena looking at me. I listened as she recounted her absurd childhood experiences. I heard Helena describe how her parents used to pour hard liquor into juice boxes. She mentioned her mother once gave her sleeping pills so she could go out alone. She lamented that her mother had now become a selfish old hag. I heard her ask me whether my father also drank.\n[2004-01-01 03:35:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I laughed along with everyone, listening to the laughter around the table. I told Helena my father also drank—and added that he died from it. I told them how after falling down the stairs, he refused an ambulance and simply lay on the floor for days, eating and drinking. I knew my father had been drinking heavily since I was sixteen, until his death when I was thirty. I knew he spent his final days at his mother’s house. I realized I no longer felt anything special about my father’s story.\n[2004-01-01 03:45:00] New Apartment Restaurant | I laughed loudly, pushed my plate aside, lit a cigarette, and leaned back. I looked at Nils Nils. I told Anders about the fear my father caused me when he wasn’t drinking. I recalled losing my socks at the swimming pool as a child, being beaten by my father when I got home, and being banned from ever going swimming again. I heard Karl laugh and say we were kindred spirits. I knew my grandfather once shot a crow in the leg with a gun. I remembered the childhood lie about a 'little hawk snatching hair.' I thought to myself that it was a pity Nils Nils had never met my grandfather—she would have loved him.\n[2004-01-01 03:55:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I saw Karl hesitate. I listened as he spoke about two entirely different parenting cultures. I heard Helena ask Karl whether his father had beaten him too. Karl explained that in Leivik’s tradition, spanking was seen as a duty, but his father had been very kind, and he bore no ill will. He believed it was a completely different culture from the unpredictable violence of my father. As far as I know, Karl's hometown indeed has this specific child-rearing tradition.\n[2004-01-01 04:05:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I saw Anders laugh as he imitated his mother’s hoarse voice. I watched him closely. I heard Anders talk about how he had inherited massive debts due to his father’s financial fraud. I heard him say his father had fled and remained missing ever since. When Nils Nils asked about his mother, Anders described how she was now suffering in poverty. I mentioned I had met her twice and found her sarcastic and darkly humorous. I knew Anders had once been a partner in his father’s company and ended up taking responsibility for all the signed documents.\n[2004-01-01 04:15:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Karl describe how his mother controlled the family through guilt. He talked about her fear of space—using cushions to protect her head when entering tunnels, being unable to drive on highways or near water. Anders and Helena were deeply surprised. Karl sighed, saying he had paid a high price to escape that environment. I knew Karl had barely kept in touch with his mother for years in order to break free from her control.\n[2004-01-01 04:25:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I heard Nils Nils describe her mother as utterly shameless and reckless. She told us how her mother would charge across roads, even sending her alone on vacation to Greece when she was just six. I heard Karl comment that it was the lawless seventies. I knew Nils Nils’s mother had once been an actress at the Royal Theatre.\n[2004-01-01 04:35:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I looked at her and asked about her father. I watched Nils Nils speak calmly. I heard Nils Nils describe her father’s violent and unpredictable episodes, mentioning how they often had to flee from him. She said the hardest part was waiting for disaster to strike—when it actually happened, she felt strangely calm. I learned that during his episodes, her father would climb down drainpipes or jump out of windows. As far as I know, police intervention was always required to end such incidents.\n[2004-01-01 04:45:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I saw Nils Nils smile slightly. I saw Anders turn to ask Kristina something. I heard Nils Nils recount the terrifying time when her father turned on the gas, and her mother escaped with the children only to return later and shut it off. Then I heard Anders begin questioning Kristina about her parents. I knew that during the gas incident, Nils Nils was only five years old.\n[2004-01-01 04:55:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I saw Anders and Karl burst into laughter. I looked at Kristina. I heard Kristina say her parents lived in Uppsala and were Pentecostal believers. She mentioned they even returned sand collected after snow clearing back to the highway authority. I heard Karl joke that her parents were so good they must be the Devil’s test for him. I knew Kristina’s parents never drank alcohol due to their faith—even coffee was replaced with boiled water.\n[2004-01-01 05:05:00] New Apartment Dining Room | I saw Kristina nod slightly at Anders, a faint smile on her lips. I heard Kristina talk about the loneliness she felt at age twelve when she broke away from her religious background and friends. Helena remarked how remarkably mature she must have been at such a young age. Anders joked and asked if she drank coffee now; she replied she did, except when visiting her hometown. I knew Kristina had left her original social circle at the age of twelve.\n[2004-01-01 05:15:00] New Apartment Dining Room/Kitchen | I joined the group in laughter. I stood up and began collecting plates. I saw Karl pick up some plates and follow me into the kitchen. I dumped empty shells into the trash and loaded the dishes into the dishwasher. I turned around. I heard Anders shout behind me that Karl had ‘defected.’ I heard Karl call tonight’s conversation a ‘confession night,’ an evening of opening up. I said to Karl, ‘Go for a walk? I need a smoke.’ He agreed.\n[2004-01-01 05:25:00] New Apartment Courtyard | I put on my coat, stood in the middle of the courtyard, and lit a cigarette. I saw both Karl and Anders with their hands tucked in their pockets. I heard Anders, braving the cold wind, talk about his free life running a restaurant in Spain—the best period of his life, he said. I felt the strong wind and bitter cold outside. I saw fireworks exploding above the courtyard.",

    "text": "[2004-01-01 05:35:00] new apartment courtyard | I saw Karl burst into laughter. I heard Andor confess that his business partnership had fallen apart after he was caught having an affair with his partner’s wife. He mentioned wanting to take Helena to rent a place in Granada, and I casually replied, 'Sounds nice.' I heard Karl complain that work left him almost no free time. I thought that kind of life might not be what Helena dreamed of.\n[2004-01-01 05:45:00] new apartment courtyard/stairs | I flicked my cigarette butt to the ground and stomped on it hard a few times, then led the way toward the stairs. I said to them, 'Let's go up.'\n[2004-01-08 10:53:00] Halvik Oksfjord | I saw the subway carriages approaching through the woods like a row of brightly lit rooms in the twilight. As far as I knew, I had spent several months in a basement in Oksfjord. I knew that at the end of 2003, I finally got an office in central Halvik.\n[2004-01-08 10:53:00] central Halvik office | I knew this office was actually a furnished single-room apartment belonging to Nils Nils’s friend. I moved my books and computer there between Christmas and New Year. I understood that I began working here from the first day of the new year.\n[2004-01-08 10:53:00] central Halvik office | As far as I knew, the novel had already reached one hundred and thirty pages. I knew the story began with crab fishing on a summer night, shifted into angel sketches, and ended with the life of a solitary man who writes and harms himself.\n[2004-01-08 10:53:00] central Halvik office | I heard the publisher express interest in publishing it. I also heard Jorgensen, drunk late at night on the phone, repeat, 'Too simple... you need to tell a story, Grete Lundnes!' I felt deep uncertainty about whether this work could ever be published.\n[2004-01-08 10:53:00] central Halvik office | I sat in front of my new desk, staring at the blank computer screen. I knew this was my first working day of 2004. I realized Jorgensen was right—I really did need to tell a real story.\n[2004-01-08 11:23:00] central Halvik office | I leaned back and carefully studied the poster hanging behind my desk. I knew this poster was from years ago, when Tonje and I visited the Picasso exhibition in Barcelona. I recalled this episode from my past life.\n[2004-01-08 11:23:10] central Halvik office | I saw four images on the poster: one looked like a little angel urinating, one showed bird wings, one was a photo of a 1920s pilot, and one depicted a corpse’s hand.\n[2004-01-08 11:23:20] central Halvik office | I looked out the window. I noticed the sky above the hospital across the street. I watched the pedestrians on the sidewalk. Before me lay a clear, bright blue sky. I saw low sunlight glinting off windows and railings. The breath of passersby formed white plumes, making them look as if they were on fire. Everyone was wrapped in thick hats and scarves.\n[2004-01-08 11:23:40] Håvik City Center Office | I let my gaze wander across the engineered hardwood floor. Suddenly, I fixed my eyes on a grain pattern two meters from my chair. I saw that on the reddish-brown floor, knots and wood grains had formed a clear image: Christ wearing a crown of thorns. I was captivated by this sudden discovery.\n[2004-01-08 11:24:00] Håvik City Center Office | I noticed a damp stain on the ceiling that looked like a running dog, peeling paint on the stairs resembling snow-covered valleys, and clouds that seemed upside down. I realized I wasn't particularly moved by the image of Christ in the wood grain—I merely remembered it, since such images are common throughout buildings.\n[2004-01-08 11:34:00] Håvik City Center Office | Ten minutes later, I stood up to refill the kettle with water. Suddenly, I recalled a long-ago evening from childhood. I remembered seeing a similar face on the water surface during a news report about a missing fishing boat.\n[2004-01-08 11:34:05] Håvik City Center Office | An image of my childhood living room appeared in my mind—our teak-framed television, patches of snow on the dim hillside outside the window, and suddenly, a face emerging on the sea surface within the TV screen.\n[2004-01-08 11:34:10] Håvik City Center Office | I recalled the atmosphere of life in the residential areas of the seventies—a mood that now felt almost nostalgically familiar.\n[2004-01-08 11:34:15] Håvik City Center Office | The telephone rang suddenly, making me jump. A sudden telephone ring pierced my ears. I realized no one knew my number here, and I felt deeply puzzled.\n[2004-01-08 11:34:30] Håvik City Center Office | After five rings, the phone finally stopped. The water in the kettle was nearly boiling, emitting a hissing sound. I felt as though the hissing sound resembled someone slowly approaching me.\n[2004-01-08 11:36:00] Håvik City Center Office | I scooped two spoons of coffee into my cup, poured in hot water, put on my clothes, and prepared to leave. Before stepping out, I paused and turned back for one last look at the face in the wooden paneling. I watched the black coffee swirl in the cup, releasing rising steam.\n[2004-01-08 11:36:10] Håvik City Center Office | That grain truly resembled Christ—his face half-turned, as if in pain, gazing toward a field, with a crown of thorns upon his head.\n[2004-01-08 11:37:00] Håvik City Center Office | I realized it wasn't the faces themselves that mattered, but the fact that forgotten memories from childhood were resurfacing. I noticed I couldn't recall the sequence of events, yet I could vividly remember the furnishings of rooms and the places I'd been.\n[2004-01-08 11:40:00] Harvik Street | I came out onto the street holding a coffee cup, crossing the road. I felt an awkward sense of exposure carrying an indoor coffee cup outside, and decided I'd get my morning coffee in those thick paper cups from 7-Eleven from now on.\n[2004-01-08 11:45:00] Bench outside the hospital | I walked over to the bench outside the hospital, sat down on the icy seat, lit a cigarette, and looked down at the road below. I could feel the coffee in my hand turning lukewarm.\n[2004-01-08 11:45:10] Bench outside the hospital | I could feel that although the sun was shining, the temperature might only be minus fifteen degrees. I learned that this morning the thermometer outside our kitchen showed minus twenty degrees.\n[2004-01-08 11:46:00] Bench outside the hospital | I took out my phone from my pocket to check for any missed calls. I knew we were waiting for the baby due in a week. I realized I was fully prepared for Nils Nils to call at any moment saying the baby was coming.\n[2004-01-08 11:47:00] Bench outside the hospital | I heard the pedestrian traffic light at the intersection start ticking, and saw the street below grow empty. Two middle-aged women in white coats walked close together, hugging their arms tightly under their armpits, stepping quickly out of the entrance. Looking at the way they walked, I silently remarked in my mind that they resembled some strange kind of duck.\n[2004-01-08 11:47:30] Bench outside the hospital | The ticking of the traffic light stopped, and cars rushed out from the shadows up the slope like panting dogs, studded tires rolling over the asphalt.\n[2004-01-08 11:48:00] Bench outside the hospital | I put the phone back in my pocket and gripped the coffee cup with both hands. I saw the steam rising slowly from the cup, mingling with the smoke drifting from my mouth.\n[2004-01-08 11:50:00] Bench outside the hospital | I noticed the shouting and noise from the school suddenly fell silent, followed by the sound of the class bell ringing. I knew the school was just twenty meters up from my office.\n[2004-01-08 11:51:00] Bench outside the hospital | I realized the sources of sound here were becoming familiar, yet would soon fade into subconsciousness. I thought that writing is about extracting real presence from the shadows of the known, but I was still pondering how to guide myself toward that direction of writing.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Bench outside the hospital | I sat in the Harvik district drinking coffee, my muscles tensing from the cold. I watched the smoke rise and disperse into the air above my head. I kept turning over in my mind the question of my writing goal.",

    "text": "[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I noticed the morning street filled with congested vehicles. At six-thirty, laborers wearing safety boots and hands caked with grime gathered at the café for breakfast, their phones ringing incessantly. I learned this is the daily rhythm of an area situated along a major traffic route. I know workers are accustomed to keeping their tape measures tucked in their pockets.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I saw the street filled with people dressed in soft, high-quality clothing. I understood these individuals were likely lawyers, journalists, architects, or project managers who would spend the day in offices.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I saw nurses spilling out from buses. Around eight o'clock, the foot traffic thinned, then retirees appeared dragging wheeled suitcases, followed by parents pushing strollers. Gradually, the street became dominated by delivery vans, trucks, and taxis. I realized that during this quiet morning hour, the flow of traffic was shifting.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I saw sunlight glinting off the windows across the street. A group of kindergarten children wearing identical reflective vests walked past, led seriously by their teacher. I observed that the children looked like fairy-tale characters, while the teacher resembled a shepherd nearing the edge of boredom. I felt that the footsteps on the outdoor staircase were almost inaudible.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I heard various sounds of work from the surrounding area—someone sweeping fallen leaves, others repairing roads, and some painting houses. I realized these sounds were loud enough for me to sense the presence of nearby activity.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I saw a wave of office workers surge toward restaurants, only for the crowd to quickly disperse. In the afternoon, schoolchildren passed joyfully beneath my window after classes ended. I understood this pattern of crowds repeated every day. I knew the children heading to school in the morning carried a certain silence, while after school they became carefree and lively. I noticed this rhythm unfolded in exact reverse of the morning's.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Harvik Street | I saw sunlight streaming onto the wall inside my room, and heard slow, heavy footsteps ascending the outdoor stairway. The number of people waiting for transportation outside the hospital entrance kept growing, and the street filled with private cars. Late into the night, I could hear young men and women shouting and laughing, until at six in the morning, a new rhythm began again with the arrival of the buses. From what I understand, peak activity occurs around five in the afternoon, followed by a period of calm, until nighttime life begins around ten o'clock.\n[2004-01-08 11:55:00] Bench outside the hospital | I realized life and death are interdependent. I thought about how the city does not care who occupies these spaces—even if all the current passersby will be dead in a hundred and fifty years, people will still cross the intersection in the same patterns. I reflected that new faces will replace old ones, but in truth, there is no essential difference.\n[2004-01-08 12:15:00] Bench outside the hospital | I tossed the cigarette butt onto the ground and drank the last sip of my coffee, now completely cold.\n[2004-01-08 12:15:05] Bench outside the hospital | I realized that what I was seeing now was life, yet what I was contemplating was death.\n[2004-01-08 12:15:10] bench outside the hospital | I stood up, rubbed my hands against my thighs a few times, and walked toward the traffic lights at the intersection below.\n[2004-01-08 12:15:30] intersection | I watched as a huge trailer truck approached, jolting over the road, and came to a stop in front of the sidewalk when the traffic light turned red. I saw slush curling up from the rear of passing cars. The clanking of metal chains rang in my ears, along with the sound of the trailer’s brakes being applied.\n[2004-01-08 12:16:00] intersection | As I passed in front of the vehicle, I tried to catch the driver's eye and nodded at him. I saw him staring at his hands, putting something resembling a map back inside the cab. I always feel a sense of guilt when cars stop because of me. I thought the trailer was Polish and that the driver might have been looking at a map. I realized he hadn’t actually seen me, but I didn’t think it mattered.\n[2004-01-08 12:20:00] office building entrance | I stood by the door, entered the code, and stepped inside. I pulled out my keys, ran up the stairs, quickly unlocked the office door, slipped in, and closed it behind me. I heard the elevator machinery humming.\n[2004-01-08 12:20:10] Håvik city center office | I felt warmth on my skin, and a tingling sensation in my hands. Outside, the piercing siren of an ambulance rang in my ears.\n[2004-01-08 12:30:00] Håvik city center office | I started boiling water to make coffee, and while waiting, I began writing down some of the gloomiest, most dreary words. I thought about using the time while waiting for the water to boil to write something.\n[2004-01-08 12:30:10] Håvik city center office | I saw dust dancing in the slanted rays of light. From next door, the sound of someone playing piano reached my ears.\n[2004-01-08 12:35:00] Håvik city center office | I heard the faint hissing sound of water heating in the kettle. I realized what I had just written wasn't good—though not terrible, it certainly wasn't good either.\n[2004-01-08 12:36:00] Håvik city center office | I walked over to the cabinet, scooped two spoonfuls of coffee powder into a cup, and poured in the hot water. I saw dark coffee rising with a swirl of steam against the inner walls of the cup.\n[2004-01-08 14:00:00] Håvik city center office | I heard the phone ring again.\n[2004-01-08 14:00:10] Håvik City Center Office | I placed the cup on the desk and waited quietly until the phone rang twice before lifting the receiver.\n[2004-01-08 14:00:15] Håvik City Center Office | I said into the phone, \"Hello?\"\n[2004-01-08 14:00:20] Håvik City Center Office | I heard a familiar voice from the other end: \"Hi, it's me.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:00:25] Håvik City Center Office | I replied, \"Hi.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:00:30] Håvik City Center Office | I heard her ask, \"I just wanted to know how things are going? Do you like it there?\"\n[2004-01-08 14:00:35] Håvik City Center Office | I could hear from her voice through the receiver that she was full of joy. I knew she was in a very good mood right now.\n[2004-01-08 14:00:40] Håvik City Center Office | I told her, \"I don't know. I've only been here a few hours, you know that.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:00:50] Håvik City Center Office | I felt a sudden silence on the other end of the line.\n[2004-01-08 14:00:55] Håvik City Center Office | I heard her ask, \"Are you coming home soon?\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:00] Håvik City Center Office | I said to her somewhat impatiently, \"You don't need to keep nagging me—I'll come back when it's time.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:10] Håvik City Center Office | I noticed she didn't answer me anymore on the other end of the phone.\n[2004-01-08 14:01:20] Håvik City Center Office | After a moment, I asked her, \"Should I buy something?\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:25] Håvik City Center Office | I heard her reply, \"No. I've already bought it.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:30] Håvik City Center Office | I said, \"OK. See you later.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:35] Håvik City Center Office | Her voice came through my ear: \"Alright. Goodbye. Or wait—could you buy some cocoa?\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:40] Håvik City Center Office | I told her, \"Cocoa. Anything else?\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:45] Håvik City Center Office | I heard her say, \"No. That's all.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:50] Håvik City Center Office | I said, \"OK. Goodbye.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:01:55] Håvik City Center Office | I heard her softly say, \"Bye now.\"\n[2004-01-08 14:50:00] Håvik City Center Office | I put down the handset and sat in the chair for a long time. The surroundings were quiet and empty. I thought sitting here wasn't about sorting out thoughts or emotions, but more about feeling the atmosphere of this empty room.",

I felt that the coffee in the cup had already turned lukewarm.\n[2004-01-08 14:54:00] Håvik city center office | I moved the mouse to turn off the screensaver and glanced at the time, noticing it was six minutes to three.\n[2004-01-08 14:55:00] Håvik city center office | I read through the text on the screen once more, then pressed the toggle key to save it into the draft page.\n[2004-01-08 14:55:00] Håvik city center office | I thought about how I’d already spent five years on this novel, and if the result didn’t meet expectations, it would be too fragile to withstand scrutiny. I realized the content presented was too thin, but I understood the solution lay within the existing words—I needed to capture the essence hidden between the lines.\n[2004-01-08 14:55:00] Håvik city center office | I knew the story was set in the 1880s, but the characters and elements originated from the 1980s. I felt everything I needed already existed, only compressed. I thought the most important thing was to set the words in motion with one idea. I realized that for years I’d tried and failed to write about my father because it was too close to my life, too difficult to force myself into another literary form.\n[2004-01-08 14:55:00] Håvik city center office | I believed the only law of literature is that form comes first; otherwise, the result would be insignificant. I thought writing was more about destruction than creation. I recalled how Rimbaud saw writing as a bond he had to break in pursuit of freedom. I also thought of Sandemose, who broke the form yet remained within it, while Rimbaud chose to go to Africa.\n[2004-01-08 15:30:00] Håvik city center office | Under the influence of subconscious impulse, I suddenly lifted my eyes and met the gaze of a woman. I saw that when she noticed me looking at her, she quickly turned her eyes away. I saw her sitting inside a bus outside the window. Night had fallen, and I noticed the only light in the room came from the desk lamp, standing out conspicuously in the darkness like a beacon attracting moths.\n[2004-01-08 15:31:00] Håvik city center office | I stood up and walked to the window, unfastened the blinds, and let them down. I saw the cars outside slowly starting up.\n[2004-01-08 15:31:10] Håvik city center office | I realized it was time to go home, no matter what. I remembered saying 'soon'—but that had actually been an hour ago.\n[2004-01-08 15:31:20] Håvik city center office | I recalled how cheerful she sounded when she called me. I felt a sudden heaviness in my chest, a sense of discomfort. I blamed myself for responding to her anxiety and longing with such irritation.\n[2004-01-08 15:32:00] Håvik City Center Office | I stood motionless in the center of the floor. I felt as if I wanted to radiate this pain out of my body, but I knew it would never disappear on its own. I thought I had to take action to make everything right again, and I wondered how I could possibly undo what had happened.\n[2004-01-08 15:35:00] Håvik City Center Office | I shut down the computer, put it in my backpack, rinsed my cup and placed it in the sink, unplugged the loose power cord, and turned off the lights. I put on my coat, ready to leave. I saw moonlight-like streetlight beams slowly moving through the slats of the blinds. Deep inside me, the image of her in that spacious apartment kept resurfacing.\n[2004-01-08 15:40:00] Håvik Street | I stepped onto the street. I pulled the hood of my coat over my hat, lowered my head against the stinging snowflakes, and began walking forward. I felt the cold gnawing at my face. I saw tiny snow particles swirling in the air.\n[2004-01-08 15:40:00] Håvik Street | I saw crowds flowing along the sidewalks, shop windows filled with all kinds of goods. I noticed escalators turning up and down inside the mall, attractive figures appearing on TV screens, and long lines forming at cash registers. I knew that on days when I felt good, I usually walked past Tønnerud Street, Queen Street, and Grass Field, finally reaching my apartment on Cabinet Street. I knew the Cabinet Street area had many shops, cafés, and cinemas. I thought about how people gathered and dispersed, just like the ever-changing clouds above the city.\n[2004-01-08 15:40:00] Håvik Street | I saw the dim window of a driving school, crates of old magazines and records outside a secondhand store. Around me were laundromats, barbershops, and run-down bars. As far as I knew, another quieter route was along Rodman Street and Holland Street. I knew those were mostly residential areas, where passersby tended to walk alone, hurrying without pause. I realized that when I'm in a good mood, I enjoy weaving through crowds and observing faces, but when I'm feeling low, I resent the same scene and prefer taking secluded backstreets.\n[2004-01-08 15:45:00] Håvik Street | I walked with my head down, crossing the street. As I passed the windows, I glanced in from time to time. I saw a barber impatiently jerking his customer's head back into place. I felt dry snowflakes flying in the air. I saw the projecting buttresses of apartment buildings and rooftops covered in snow. I noticed an empty front desk at a hotel, a Black barber cutting a customer’s hair in a barbershop, and children laughing as they sat on a staircase.\n[2004-01-08 15:50:00] Beside Håvik Astronomical Museum | I saw the Håvik Astronomical Museum standing across the street. I noticed the lush trees and the light spilling from houses, spreading outward as if crowned by a dark halo above. I knew the observatory dome had been completed during the city’s peak in the 18th century. I knew the thick foliage obscured its brilliance.\n[2004-01-08 15:50:00] Beside Håvik Astronomical Museum | I saw magnificent, grand buildings rising all around. I learned that the top of the observatory now housed a café. From my observation, Håvik’s 18th-century architectural style closely resembled that of Leivik. I knew that farms established in the 1720s already sounded ancient enough in the countryside. I remembered the strong sense of history I felt the first time I went there.\n[2004-01-08 15:50:00] Beside Håvik Astronomical Museum | I recalled my grandmother’s sister, Borgfrid. I had heard that the house on her farm had stood since the 16th century, only to be torn down in the 1960s to make way for modern construction.\n[2004-01-08 15:51:00] Beside Håvik Astronomical Museum | I wondered whether this involved a longing for familial closeness. I thought about how Jørst’s past couldn’t compare to Håvik’s. I felt my thoughts might be built on illusion, that I was perhaps fooling myself. Because I had no history, I wanted to invent one—and so I closed my eyes for a few seconds to dispel the feeling.\n[2004-01-08 15:55:00] Dutch Street | I continued walking down the street and, after turning the corner, entered Dutch Street. I saw two rows of cars piled with snow and utterly lifeless. I noticed this street was wedged between major roads, appearing like a back alley among back alleys.\n[2004-01-08 15:56:00] Dutch Street | I shifted the shopping bag in my hand to my left, freeing my right hand to grab my hooded coat and shake off the snow. To avoid hitting my head on the scaffolding that stretched across the sidewalk, I bent forward slightly. Before me stood scaffolding erected along the sidewalk; I noticed the tarp covering it high above flapping violently in the strong wind.\n[2004-01-08 15:57:00] Dutch Street | I walked out of that tunnel-like passage and saw a person approaching me. He stopped right in front of me and made a gesture signaling me to halt.\n[2004-01-08 15:57:10] Dutch Street | I watched as the man pulled out his phone and held it to his ear, then shortly afterward put it back down. I heard him say to me, 'You need to go to the sidewalk on the other side of the street—this side is on fire.' He also mentioned that, as far as he knew, something inside the building might have exploded.\n[2004-01-08 15:57:20] Dutch Street | I heard him warn me seriously, 'It's serious—cross over to the opposite side of the street.'\n[2004-01-08 15:57:25] Dutch Street | I asked him, 'Where's the fire?'\n[2004-01-08 15:57:30] Dutch Street | I followed the direction of his pointing finger and saw him indicating a window about ten meters ahead. I heard him say, 'There.' I saw the upper part of the window open, and smoke seeping out from within.\n[2004-01-08 15:58:00] Dutch Street | I decided to cross the street diagonally so I could get a clearer view of the situation. I saw a room illuminated by two spotlights, crammed full of instruments, cables, paint cans, toolboxes, drills, insulation materials, and a short ladder. Smoke was spreading out from among these items, tentatively creeping outward. I thought crossing the street would not only allow me to see better but also partly comply with his strong urging to keep my distance.\n[2004-01-08 15:58:10] Dutch Street | I shouted and asked him, 'Did you call the fire station?'\n[2004-01-08 15:58:15] Dutch Street | I saw him nod at me. He brought his phone to his ear again, then took it down a moment later. I heard him reply, 'They're already on their way.'\n[2004-01-08 16:00:00] Dutch Street | I observed from across the street and saw the man pacing back and forth wildly on the opposite side. The smoke came into view; I watched it forming new patterns inside the house and slowly spreading outward.\n[2004-01-08 16:00:10] Dutch Street | I said to him, \"I can't see any flames inside. Can you?\"\n[2004-01-08 16:00:15] Dutch Street | I heard him reply briefly, \"It's smoldering.\"\n[2004-01-08 16:05:00] Dutch Street | I stood there for a few more minutes, then finally decided to continue walking home. Suddenly, I felt a chill. Looking ahead, I thought nothing else would happen.\n[2004-01-08 16:10:00] Mochengdao Road intersection | Before reaching the intersection at Mochengdao Road, I heard the first fire truck’s shrill siren, and then saw it appear at the top of the hill. I noticed people around me turning to look.\n[2004-01-08 16:10:10] Mochengdao Road intersection | I stared at the fire truck on the slope, watching it descend slowly and steadily. Though the sharp siren stirred a sense of urgency in me, the large vehicle moved up the hill at an extremely slow pace.",

    "text": "[2004-01-08 16:11:00] in front of the supermarket | I saw the traffic light turn green, so I crossed the street and entered the supermarket on the opposite side.\n[2004-01-09 01:00:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I thought I was completely sleepless tonight. I recalled that under normal circumstances, I could fall asleep within minutes—except during the period when I had sleepwalking—and even after the most turbulent days, I used to sleep soundly through the night.\n[2004-01-09 01:05:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I lay in bed with my head against the pillow. I listened to the sounds outside, my thoughts drifting now here, now there. I saw Nils Nils sleeping quietly beside me. I heard the city's ambient noises rise and fall—the movements of pedestrians outdoors, the creaks from neighbors above and below, the howling of ventilation systems—gradually growing louder. I closed my eyes, yet clearly realized I wasn't sleepy at all—my mind remained fully awake.\n[2004-01-09 01:10:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I thought about how the child in her womb was affecting her dreams. I imagined her restless visions: enormous waves engulfing beaches, floods pouring into apartments, or even the child vanishing at a train station. Those dreams were always filled with water and unreachable despair.\n[2004-01-09 01:15:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I wondered in my mind about her dreams—perhaps she would dream of a child with an adult's face, or of giving birth only to endless water. I couldn't help but ponder what my own dreams might look like.\n[2004-01-09 01:20:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I realized I had never dreamed about children. For this coming new life, instead of feeling its profound significance, I sensed only guilt. I recalled that my dreams almost always remained in the childhood before I turned twenty, and that feeling of being diminished lingered even after waking. I marveled at the strange symmetry between these night visions and their daytime forgetting.\n[2004-01-09 01:30:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | As far as I knew, I had once lived within a close-knit social network. But after moving to Halvik, though I could still remember, that sense of continuity seemed to have broken. I felt that since the move, the emotional resonance brought by memories had completely vanished. I realized I no longer longed for the past; in fact, I felt a faint, almost imperceptible aversion toward those old friends and past events whenever they came to mind.\n[2004-01-09 02:00:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | Thoughts made me open my eyes. I lay motionless on the bed, staring in that direction. Before me hung the cardboard lamp above the headboard, dark and glowing like a miniature moon. I felt that this intense nostalgia was not merely guilt—it was practically a peculiar madness. I reflected on the gains and losses of breaking free from longing for the past, even thinking it verged on something pathological.\n[2004-01-09 02:05:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I turned over and studied Nils Nils lying sideways facing me. Her large belly came into view, seeming somewhat out of proportion with the rest of her body. I remembered how just yesterday, she stood in front of the mirror laughing heartily at the extra flesh on her thighs.\n[2004-01-09 02:10:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I learned that the baby is now positioned head-down toward the pelvis and will remain in this position until birth. According to the hospital’s maternity ward, it's normal for the baby to stay still for long periods. I know that with heartbeat and bodily development, things will naturally come to fruition in time.\n[2004-01-09 02:15:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I carefully got up, crossed the room, and went into the kitchen to pour myself a glass of water.\n[2004-01-09 02:16:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I looked at the people waiting outside in line. I saw groups of elderly people chatting at the entrance of Naren Concert Hall. Men and women aged sixty to eighty, dressed in their finest clothes, arriving in clusters for the dance night. Watching their eager expressions, I suddenly felt a deep, piercing pain stab into my core.\n[2004-01-09 02:17:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | The image of that old man left a deep impression on me. I saw him quickly step into the crowd in the lobby. I recalled an autumn night when I first saw him appear at the crossroads. He wore a light yellow suit and a soft straw hat, walking with a slight stumble. I noticed that while other elders came in pairs, he was alone. As far as I knew, the dance nights there were held once a month. I realized he radiated a unique presence. A sudden clarity struck me—he was searching for something he could never find again, because time and the world had already moved on without him.\n[2004-01-09 02:30:00] in front of the bedroom window at Cabinet Street apartment | I saw a taxi turn onto the sidewalk outside, and the passenger cheerfully folded up an umbrella and climbed inside. I put down my water glass and walked over to the bedroom window. Further down the street, I saw two police cars approaching with flashing blue lights. Since they made no siren sound, the silence gave me an ominous feeling. I heard them stop somewhere nearby in the neighborhood.\n[2004-01-09 02:35:00] in front of the bedroom window in Cabinet Street apartment | I observed six officers rushing into the building, and two others remaining by the police car. I saw a man in his fifties pass by, shrinking back and not daring to enter. I noticed those two standing at the doorway watching the police car disappear, snow gradually whitening their hair. Before my eyes was the police car parked in front of US Video Store. I saw men trying to enter the store who made great efforts to appear natural, so as not to attract attention. I observed that after the door opened, the police dragged out a man with his pants fallen down, then cuffed him inside the vehicle. I learned it was a video store frequented by men. Though I’ve never entered, I know its layout well: a long staircase leading down to a dim basement, seats equipped with televisions, and various films and tissues catering to sexual preferences. I’ve lived here for a year, and from my observation, the men coming and going display peculiar, carefully concealed body language. I recall how those men are always cautious when opening the door, careful not to look around.\n[2004-01-09 02:45:00] in front of the bedroom window in Cabinet Street apartment | I know the scene of the video store’s basement: a long staircase descending into darkness, with a payment counter, black faux-leather seats equipped with TVs, and rolls of tissue paper. From my observation, the men there move along their solitary paths—never looking at each other, never speaking. I know August Strindberg once claimed stars were holes in the wall. I watch the rivers of souls flowing down the stairs, sometimes recalling Strindberg’s words. I think of how they peer through these windows at the world, yet never speak of what they see—a behavior utterly unlike ordinary people. I even feel like laughing, picturing men groaning in cubicles, staring at images of intercourse. I don’t understand this behavior, but I can’t help wondering what kind of vulgarity or sense of enclosure drives them there.\n[2004-01-09 02:50:00] in front of the bedroom window in Cabinet Street apartment | I saw the police appear outside the shop, standing shoulder to shoulder with shields, wearing helmets and holding batons. I heard demonstrators spitting contemptuously under police surveillance, loudly cursing or shouting slogans directly at those entering and exiting the store. I know the police presence is usually linked to recurring protest activities; the demonstrators are deeply dissatisfied that the authorities have not shut down the store.\n[2004-01-09 02:51:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I heard Nils Nils ask behind me, “What’s happening?”\n[2004-01-09 02:51:10] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I turned around to look at her. I asked her, “You’re awake?” I heard her reply, “Just woke up.”\n[2004-01-09 02:51:20] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I saw her close her eyes again after hearing what I said. I told her, “I just couldn’t sleep. There are a few police cars outside. Go back to sleep for a while.”",

    "text": "[2004-01-09 02:55:00] in front of the bedroom window in Cabinet Street apartment | I watched the door downstairs open, and two officers dragging out a man whose legs could not move. I saw him kneel on the ground, then rise and pull up his pants, which had slipped down to his knees. I noticed one officer cuffing his hands behind his back and guiding him into the car. I watched the two officers stand in the heavy snow with their hands in their pockets, watching the police car vanish down the street. Before me fell snowflakes drifting endlessly; I noticed the snow gradually turning the two officers’ hair white. I felt the way he was carried out seemed somewhat cruel, but surely it was necessary.\n[2004-01-09 03:00:00] Cabinet Street apartment living room | I walked into the living room, watched television for a while, then turned it off. I took down a book about Constable from the shelf above the sofa and sat down to leaf through it. I saw the faint light from the streetlamp softly illuminating the walls and floor. I noticed the book mostly contained oil sketches of clouds, landscapes, and seascapes. I worried the sound or blurry images from the TV might trigger memories of Nils Nils’s cursed manic period, so I decided to read instead to pass the time.\n[2004-01-09 03:10:00] Cabinet Street apartment living room | I quickly flipped through these paintings. I saw a sky sketch dated September 6, 1822: at the top, blue sky; below, white mist and rolling clouds, with shadows showing faint green, deep green, even ink-blue tones. I learned from the caption that Constable painted this on an afternoon in Hampstead. Although some have questioned the accuracy of the date, weather records from that day support the cloud formations depicted in the painting. I found myself filled with tears—those beautiful, intimate emotions converging instantly. I recalled studying that green cloud before, the overwhelming intensity impossible to explain logically.\n[2004-01-09 03:30:00] Cabinet Street apartment living room | I know I once studied art history and was accustomed to analyzing artworks. I remember visiting Claude’s classical landscape paintings alone at national museums in Halvik, Bærelund, or Shannest. I realize now that what matters most to me is the experiential process of artistic feeling—an approach that contradicts all the analytical theories I’ve learned. I feel I can find freedom in museums, yet also a certain indescribable greed for the infinite, leaving me unsettled even after I leave.\n[2004-01-09 03:50:00] Cabinet Street apartment living room | I sat there flipping through it for an hour, and each time I saw that green cloud, I felt a shiver inside. I realized that even though logically I believed realism in painting was a thing of the past, I was still captivated by the unity of that color and mood. I heard an inner voice constantly saying 'yes,' and I asked myself where exactly that place I absolutely had to go was.\n[2004-01-09 04:00:00] Cabinet Street apartment living room | I noticed it was already four o'clock. I thought this was still the middle of the night, and I couldn't possibly go to the office at this hour. But then I wondered—if it were half past four, would that count as early morning?\n[2004-01-09 04:05:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I walked into the kitchen and put the plate of meatballs and noodles into the microwave. During the few minutes it heated up, I went into the bathroom, took a shower, got dressed, and returned to the kitchen. I poured myself a glass of water, sat down, and immediately began eating.\n[2004-01-09 04:15:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I sensed that the outside streets were still wrapped in silence. As far as I knew, the city only rested during the hours before five. I recalled the twelve years I spent in Baysang, when I often got up in the middle of the night chasing a certain feeling of 'freedom,' rebelling against the conventional nine-to-four life. I realized that although I still kept this habit, its purpose had shifted—from seeking freedom to fulfilling a need for solitude.\n[2004-01-09 04:20:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I knew my father used to set up a small private apartment entirely for himself within our house, where he always enjoyed his nights immensely. I realized that in this habit of being alone at night, I shared something in common with my father.\n[2004-01-09 04:25:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I rinsed the plate and put it into the dishwasher, then walked into the bedroom. I saw that when I stopped by the bed, Nils Nils opened his eyes.\n[2004-01-09 04:30:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I said to her, 'You can really sleep.' I heard her ask what time it was, and I replied, 'Half past four.'\n[2004-01-09 04:30:10] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I nodded at him. I heard her ask me, 'Have you been up there the whole time?' I asked her, 'I'm thinking of going to the office. Is that okay?' I heard her reply with puzzled tone, 'Now?'\n[2004-01-09 04:30:20] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I said to her, 'I can't sleep anyway—might as well do something useful with the time.' I heard her pleading, 'Don't... come, lie down.'\n[2004-01-09 04:30:30] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I asked her, 'Didn't you hear what I just said?' I heard her say she didn’t want to lie here alone and urged me to go tomorrow morning instead. I replied, 'Now is tomorrow morning’s earliest.'\n[2004-01-09 04:30:40] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I watched the door close behind me. I heard her complain that it was the middle of the night and reminded me she could go into labor at any moment. I replied, 'Goodbye.'\n[2004-01-09 04:35:00] Cabinet Street | I put on my coat in the hallway and grabbed my backpack with the computer before heading out. I saw a snowplow approaching down the street below. I felt the cold air hit my face as I stepped onto the snow-covered sidewalk. I heard the heavy iron blade of the snowplow rumbling against the asphalt.\n[2004-01-09 04:36:00] Cabinet Street | I thought about how she always pulls me back. I couldn't help wondering—since she was already asleep, why did I have to stay there at all?\n[2004-01-09 04:37:00] Cabinet Street | I started walking forward. I saw the sky above the rooftops, dark and heavy, and noticed the snow had stopped. The roar of the snowplow’s engine, the creaking hinges, and the scraping of metal on pavement reached my ears—I thought they sounded like noises from hell.\n[2004-01-09 04:40:00] Baker David Street | I turned into the empty Baker David Street and stopped by the nursing home entrance. I saw the restaurant marked KGB by the roadside. Everything around was silent. I realized Nils Nils was right—the child could come at any time, and she didn’t like being alone. I asked myself why I was going to the office at this hour. I thought—if I hadn’t been ready these past five years, could I really write it today?\n[2004-01-09 04:41:00] Baker David Street | I silently called myself a fool. She was waiting for our child—how could I leave her to face this alone?\n[2004-01-09 04:45:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I walked back, dropped my backpack in the hallway and took off my coat. I heard her making sounds from the bedroom.\n[2004-01-09 04:45:10] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I entered the bedroom and came to her side. I heard her ask, 'Is that you, Grete Lundnes?' I answered, 'It's me.' I saw the questioning look in her eyes.\n[2004-01-09 04:45:20] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I said to her, 'You're right. I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry I just left like that.' I heard her generously apologize, saying I should go to work.\n[2004-01-09 04:45:30] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I said, 'I'll work later.' I heard her assure me everything was fine at home, telling me to go ahead, and she'd call if anything happened.\n[2004-01-09 04:45:40] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I lay down beside her. I briefly answered, \"No.\" I heard her call my name, then laugh.\n[2004-01-09 04:46:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I said to her, \"Now you've taken on my earlier attitude, and I've taken on yours. But deep down, I know you're actually saying the opposite.\" I thought to myself, I've always loved how she calls me by my full name.\n[2004-01-09 04:46:10] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I felt her moving closer toward me. I said to him wistfully, \"This is all too complicated for me—can we just sleep here for now? And have breakfast together before I leave, would you like that?\" I heard her reply, \"I'd love to.\"\n[2004-01-09 04:47:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I felt her body radiating warmth like a stove. I ran my fingers through her hair and gently kissed her lips. I saw her close her eyes and tilt her head back. I asked her, \"What did you say?\"\n[2004-01-09 04:47:10] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I noticed she didn't answer me, but instead took my hand and placed it on her belly. I heard her say, \"There!\" Then her voice came again in my ear, \"Can you feel it?\"\n[2004-01-09 04:47:20] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I felt a hard lump suddenly rise beneath my palm on her skin. I noticed myself lifting my hand to look at it. I couldn't help exclaiming, \"Oh!\"\n[2004-01-09 04:48:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I heard Nils Nils say, \"She's lost patience—I know it.\" I saw her belly being pushed upward from within, the skin bulging outward as if something were pressing against it, like ripples beneath calm water, then fading away.\n[2004-01-09 04:48:10] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I asked her, \"That's a foot, right?\" I heard her softly confirm it. I added, \"It seems like she's trying to come out this way.\" I noticed Nils Nils chuckled.\n[2004-01-09 04:48:20] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I asked her, \"Does it hurt?\" I saw her shake her head at me. Her voice came again, \"I can feel it, but it doesn't hurt—just strange, incredible.\" I replied, \"Totally understand.\"\n[2004-01-09 04:50:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I pressed myself tightly against her and placed my hand on her belly once more. Finally, I closed my eyes. I heard the mailbox flap in the hallway snap shut. A truck passed outside, its sound reaching my ears, and I felt the windowpanes vibrate.\n[2004-01-09 05:00:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I felt the thoughts and images in my consciousness moving uncontrollably. I lay there like a lazy sheepdog of thought, aware that sleep was just within reach, so I let myself sink into the darkness.\n[2004-01-09 10:55:00] Cabinet Street apartment bedroom | I woke up from my sleep. I noticed the clock on the mantelpiece showed five minutes to eleven, and inwardly grumbled that this was a damn weekday. I heard Nils Nils rummaging around in the kitchen.",

    "text": "[2004-01-09 11:00:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I got dressed and walked into the kitchen. I noticed the toaster had just popped up two perfectly toasted slices of bread. Before me stood a small coffee pot hissing on the electric stove, juice and various spreads laid out on the table. I saw two crisp slices of toast already placed on a plate.\n[2004-01-09 11:01:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I sat down at the table. I heard her ask me, 'Did you sleep well?' I replied, 'Yes, I did.'\n[2004-01-09 11:02:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I buttered the toast, watching the fat instantly melt and fill the tiny pores in the bread. I noticed Nils Nils moved the coffee pot away and turned off the stove.\n[2004-01-09 11:03:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | To me, her huge belly made it seem as though she was always leaning backward. I noticed that when she worked, her hands appeared as if reaching out from an invisible wall.\n[2004-01-09 11:04:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | Outside, the sky was gray and overcast. I realized the light inside was brighter than usual, guessing the roof must have been covered with fresh snow again.\n[2004-01-09 11:05:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I saw her bring over the coffee, pour it into cups, and place one in front of me. I noticed her face looked somewhat swollen, and saw her nod at me. I asked her, 'Are you feeling unwell?'\n[2004-01-09 11:06:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I watched her lower her heavy body awkwardly into a chair and add a little milk to her coffee. I heard her complain, 'I feel awful—my whole body aches, and I think I have a fever.'\n[2004-01-09 11:07:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I heard her sigh, 'Just my luck—I end up getting sick now, precisely when I need all my strength the most.'\n[2004-01-09 11:08:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I comforted her, saying, \"Labor might be delayed—it shouldn't come until you've recovered your health.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:09:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I felt her gaze fall upon me. I swallowed the last bite of bread and drained the rest of the juice in my cup. I inwardly remarked that if there was one thing I'd learned over these past months, it was that the rumor about pregnant women's emotions being volatile and unpredictable was absolutely true.\n[2004-01-09 11:10:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | Our eyes met. I took a sip of juice. I heard her challenge me, \"Don't you understand this is a disaster?\"\n[2004-01-09 11:11:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I nodded repeatedly and said, \"I understand, I do, of course. But this will pass—everything will pass.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:12:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I heard her say, \"Of course it will pass, but that’s not the point. What I mean is, I don’t want to be sick or weak when I give birth.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:13:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I saw us continuing our meal in silence. She said to me, \"I know, but you won’t actually get sick—it’s still a few days away.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:15:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I saw her look up at me again. Her beautiful gray-green eyes met mine, and I noticed that when tired, her eyes would slightly cross. I recalled her appearance in the poetry book photos, remembering the fragility in those crossed eyes. I thought about how that fragility clashed with the confidence she projected—an opposing tension that had once completely captivated me.\n[2004-01-09 11:16:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I heard her apologize, \"Sorry, I'm just so nervous.\" I replied, \"You don't have to be. I know you're someone who always prepares thoroughly for everything.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:17:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | As far as I knew, she truly was someone who needed to have future events under control. I knew she had read extensively on the subject and listened every night to meditation tapes, where a lullaby-like voice endlessly repeated the idea that pain wasn't frightening and was even something positive.\n[2004-01-09 11:18:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I remembered attending training sessions with her and visiting obstetrics demonstrations. From what I’d seen, she always wrote down prepared questions for the midwives and carefully recorded all charts and testing methods in her journal.\n[2004-01-09 11:19:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I learned that she had sent a letter in advance to the maternity ward as requested. I knew she mentioned in the letter that she would feel uneasy there and needed encouragement, but she also expressed her wish to give birth on her own strength without anesthesia.\n[2004-01-09 11:20:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I sensed the faint metallic smell of blood and entrails still hanging in the air in that room. I saw midwives constantly moving in and out of different rooms, and I kept hearing various cries, screams, and low moans from pregnant women. As far as I knew, although the maternity ward tried to create a homelike environment with sofas, carpets, and paintings, it was essentially a space reused by countless mothers. I understood that due to the endless cycle, even after cleaning, that unique odor still lingered. I felt both pained and moved. I thought about how, for the midwives working there, all of this was just an endless repetition, yet Nils Nils had expressed in that letter the most sincere hope and passion for this moment.\n[2004-01-09 11:25:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I saw her gazing out the window, so I followed her gaze and looked out as well. Before me was the roof of the opposite building, where I saw a man tied around the waist with a rope standing there shoveling snow.\n[2004-01-09 11:25:10] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I remarked, \"People in this country are crazy.\" I heard Nils Nils ask me if Leivik was like that too, and I replied no, then asked her if she was crazy as well.\n[2004-01-09 11:26:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I learned that a year before I arrived here, a boy had been killed by a falling ice block from a roof. I knew that ever since, all roof snow had to be cleared away. I knew that every warm season, sidewalks would be blocked off with red and white tape, turning everything into chaos.\n[2004-01-09 11:27:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I quickly gulped down my bread and stood up to finish the last sip of coffee in my cup. I said, \"But at least all these precautions have boosted employment. I'm off now.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:28:00] Cabinet Street apartment kitchen | I heard Nils Nils say \"Alright,\" and she asked me if I could rent a few movies on my way home. I replied of course, and asked if anything would do. She told me it didn't matter and told me to pick whatever I liked.\n[2004-01-09 11:30:00] Cabinet Street apartment bathroom | I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. As I walked down the hallway to get dressed, I noticed Nils Nils following behind me.\n[2004-01-09 11:31:00] Cabinet Street apartment hallway | I took my coat from the closet with one hand while wrapping my scarf around my neck with the other. I asked her, \"What are you going to do today?\" I heard her reply, \"Not sure, maybe go to the park, then take a shower.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:31:10] Cabinet Street apartment hallway | I asked her worriedly, \"Are you going to be okay?\" I heard her answer confidently, \"Yes, no problem.\"\n[2004-01-09 11:31:20] Cabinet Street apartment hallway | I bent down to tie my shoelace. Her huge belly came into view; I noticed one of her hands propping up her waist, looming large above me.\n[2004-01-09 11:32:00] Cabinet Street apartment hallway | I pushed my hat firmly onto my head and grabbed my laptop backpack. I said, 'OK, I'm off.' I heard her say 'OK' in reply, telling me to call if anything came up, and I promised I would.\n[2004-01-09 11:32:10] Cabinet Street apartment hallway | I watched as we kissed goodbye, then I closed the door behind me and heard it shut at my back.",

    "text": "[2004-01-09 11:33:00] Cabinet Street apartment stairwell | I saw the elevator beside the corridor rising. As the neighbor from upstairs passed within my line of sight, I glanced briefly at her and saw her lower her face toward the mirror before her.\n[2004-01-09 11:33:10] Cabinet Street apartment stairwell | As far as I know, she is a lawyer. I often see her wearing black trousers or black blouses reaching to her knees, and she always seems to greet people with a hostile expression.\n[2004-01-09 11:34:00] Cabinet Street apartment stairwell | I learned that for a time her brother lived there—a man with dark, somewhat fierce eyes but strikingly handsome. I knew that one of Nils Nils’s girlfriends had fallen for him and become involved with him. From my observations, when I spoke with him in the hallway, his eyes seemed restless. Based on what I’ve gathered, he might be a drug user.\n[2004-01-09 11:35:00] Cabinet Street apartment stairwell | I realized I actually know nothing about these complicated matters and hidden truths. I know that Karl Larsdal is truly the only friend I have in Halvik. I thought that in some ways I really am like what Karl Larsdal described. I realized I’m just like the deceived figure in Caravaggio’s painting *The Cardsharps*.\n[2004-01-09 11:40:00] Cabinet Street apartment courtyard | I walked through the long corridor past the basement laundry room and out into the courtyard. I set my backpack on the ground and leaned against the wall, looking upward. Around me was the apartment courtyard.\n[2004-01-09 11:41:00] Cabinet Street apartment courtyard | I felt the building's ventilation outlet directly above me, and smelled the warm, freshly-washed laundry scent in the air. I heard the sharp spinning noise of the washing machines during the spin cycle. Before me, gray clouds drifted slowly across a blue sky.\n[2004-01-09 11:45:00] Cabinet Street apartment courtyard | I walked to the far end of the courtyard near the fence bordering the kindergarten behind, leaned my elbows on the wall, and stood smoking. I looked up at the two towers. I saw the playground empty. Before me rose the two towers pointing skyward from King Street.\n[2004-01-09 11:46:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | To my knowledge, these towers were built in a neo-baroque style and stand as historical witnesses of the 1920s. I inwardly marvel that these buildings often fill me with a sense of nostalgia.\n[2004-01-09 11:47:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I see the towers glowing brilliantly at night; I notice the different building materials on the walls and windows, and how the gilded statues shimmer against green patinated copper panels under artificial lighting. I feel as though the statues might begin to speak at night. I think their vividness may come from some assistance of artificial light. Their daytime indifference transforms into a strange liveliness after dark.\n[2004-01-09 11:50:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I observe the street filled with passing cars, helicopters hovering in the sky like dragonflies. I see children climbing, riding bikes, sliding down slides on the playground, and hear their shouts and screams as they throw balls and run. I feel that daytime is full of distractions that make it hard to stay focused. I notice that by afternoon, the entire courtyard becomes noisy with shrill sounds like a flock of birds in the forest, but everything quiets down again at mealtime.\n[2004-01-09 11:51:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I think it would be impossible to stay outside at other times—not because of the noise, but because I fear that group of children might swarm over to me all at once.\n[2004-01-09 11:52:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I remember encountering this several times last autumn—four or five children hanging on the fence of the courtyard. I know that if they get bored, they’ll start talking to me and burst into loud laughter.\n[2004-01-09 11:53:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I understand that the boy who climbs to the front often sits alone in the sandbox. I know that whenever we’re the only two around, I usually greet him. I recall even having the impulse to tip my hat to him. I realize now that doing so would have been more for myself than for him, since he always looks at me with a fierce expression.\n[2004-01-09 11:54:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I often wonder how liberating it would be to cut away these inner feelings of sentimentality, pity, and compassion, as one might remove injured cartilage.\n[2004-01-09 11:55:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | A sudden, extremely piercing and prolonged scream erupts in my ears, sounding like: “Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.”\n[2004-01-09 11:55:10] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I jump in fright from that scream. I know the scream comes from the apartment building opposite the kindergarten, which belongs to the nursing home. Although I’ve grown accustomed to it, I still find such sounds deeply unsettling.\n[2004-01-09 11:56:00] Cabinet Street Apartment Courtyard | I know a man who usually sits on the balcony smoking, producing thunderous coughing fits. To my understanding, most residents of the nursing home keep themselves shut inside their rooms. I can almost picture an old man lying motionless in bed, completely isolated from the world. Thinking of his life, I feel that time and the world itself have already moved on, leaving him behind with that scream.\n[2004-01-09 11:57:00] Cabinet Street apartment courtyard | I walked toward the direction of the gate. I saw that the curtains and the drapes on the balcony doors were tightly drawn, but the door was still open a crack. I looked up for a while in the direction from which the scream had come. I knew there was a nurses' lounge in the house across the street. I had learned that residents from the old people's home occasionally appeared on the street—sometimes brought back by police, sometimes lingering at the roadside. I realized I normally never think about what goes on inside the old people's home, just as I avoid thinking too much about that scream.\n[2004-01-09 11:58:00] Cabinet Street apartment courtyard | I looked up for a while, then turned and walked toward the courtyard gate. I saw all the curtains were drawn, the doors facing the balconies covered with drapes, yet each door remained slightly ajar; I could feel the sound seeping out from there.\n[2004-01-09 12:00:00] Tunnel Street | I grabbed my backpack and passed through the narrow, cave-like garbage passage, opened the metal door, and stepped onto the street. I hurried toward KGB, descending the stairs down to Tunnel Street. Through the glass window of the basement laundry room, I saw a neighbor below folding a white bedsheet. Around me was the narrow corridor lined with trash bins.\n[2004-01-09 12:20:00] Holvik City Center Office | I entered the room and closed the office door behind me. I hung my coat and scarf on the wall hooks, took off my shoes on the mat, then made a cup of coffee and plugged in the computer. I sat down, sipping coffee while staring at the screen until the screensaver’s countless dots leapt out and filled the entire display.\n[2004-01-09 12:25:00] Holvik City Center Office | Before me was William Blake’s blurred painting of Newton hanging behind me, along with engravings from the eighteenth-century age of exploration I’d bought at Shannest: dead whales and dissected beetles. On the walls also hung Peder Bak’s green-and-black night scene, posters from Grinnavík, and a map of Mars. On the desk stood a green metal dolphin and a helmet I’d bought in Crete. The bookshelves were piled high with books by Paracelsus, Augustine, the Bible, and works on Baroque style and atomic physics. I saw the title displayed on the screen was 'The American Soul.' I realized that every object in the room seemed focused on this theme. I thought that although the origins of this knowledge mostly lay outside the modern world, they still radiated an astonishing aura through the sheen of history.\n[2004-01-09 12:30:00] Holvik City Center Office | I felt that in recent years, the world had somehow grown smaller, and the sense of having everything under control had become increasingly strong. Though rationally I understood the world was vast and unpredictable, sensorially, it felt already known—nothing truly new would ever happen again. I thought I understood myself and my surroundings, and even when encountering unclear phenomena, I knew how to figure them out.\n[2004-01-09 12:35:00] Holvik City Center Office | I realized understanding should not be confused with knowledge; though I lacked knowledge in many fields, this didn’t prevent my mind from classifying the unfamiliar. I reflected that even children differ only in their degree of progress along the path of understanding the world. I thought that those who truly understand more often possess a heightened awareness of the boundaries of understanding—aware of a far greater, incomprehensible world beyond themselves.\n[2004-01-09 12:40:00] Holvik City Center Office | I watched the pen in my hand, the sunlit windowpane, and students dressed for autumn standing at the courtyard crossroads. I sensed the smell of soil and leaves from her clothes sitting beside me. In my ears rang the sounds of road workers digging, the hum of a transformer, and the deep rumble beneath the entire city. I recalled that at nineteen, I encountered the assertion that 'the world is linguistic structure.' I pondered all that had happened, wondering whether for me this was merely a child’s world where I assumed I knew everything. I remembered rejecting back then the idea that the world was linguistic structure, considering it utter nonsense. I thought the world I touched, breathed, and encountered was real—calling it linguistic structure seemed absurd.\n[2004-01-09 12:45:00] Holvik City Center Office | I learned that Nietzsche once wrote in a quotation that physics is merely an interpretation of the world, and that what we measure with our classifications is actually a purely fictional world. I thought the world is simply the world—I touch it, bleed, vomit. Years later, I began for the first time to see it differently. I came to grasp what Nietzsche meant—that the values we measure actually belong to a fictional world.\n[2004-01-09 12:50:00] Holvik City Center Office | I reflected on this fictional mental world—abstract yet capable of movement within thought. I realized that in the history of natural science, everything has become transparent and explainable. I felt the entire material world being lifted into the realm of the fictional. I thought I tried to resist through fiction, yet in doing so only brought about my own failure. I recalled those fleeting moments when I seemed to glimpse an entirely different world—only for it to quickly withdraw, leaving everything as before.",

    "text": "[2004-01-09 12:55:00] Håvik city center office | I saw the landscape outside the window as a pure white expanse, with a gray, damp sky above. I noticed we were passing through an industrial area filled with natural gas tanks, and the carriage was empty, with only the new sliding doors opening and closing in complete silence. I saw the sun sinking in the west, a vivid red orb floating in the mist. I remember this was from an experience months earlier, riding the commuter train toward Håvik. I recalled the intense surge of joy striking my heart, a feeling so strong it was almost indistinguishable from pain. I realized this experience held profound significance for me. I thought about how, once that moment passed, the great meaning suddenly seemed out of place—why, I wondered, should such deep significance arise on a train journey through a factory district?\n[2004-01-09 13:00:00] Håvik city center office | I felt this emotional experience was like a unique work of art, capable of awakening my inner self. I remembered seeing Rembrandt’s late self-portraits at the Shannest National Museum, Turner’s sunsets over the sea, and works by Caravaggio, Vermeer, Monet, and others. I realized this resonance had nothing to do with era or the artist’s fame—I might remain unmoved before celebrated masterpieces, yet feel my blood quicken before an obscure Finnish Impressionist painting.\n[2004-01-09 13:05:00] Håvik city center office | I realized I didn’t know the exact reason why these paintings made such a powerful impression on me. I thought about the distance between real reality and pictorial reality—the space where something happens that makes me feel the world has taken a step forward. I sensed that ineffable state; though language fails, I felt myself within it, because we ourselves are part of it.\n[2004-01-09 13:10:00] Håvik city center office | I thought about the strangeness and mystery that touches us, guiding my thoughts toward angels. I realized that after the Enlightenment, the natural world in art had undergone a reversal—starting with Munch, humans replaced sacred landscapes. I reflected on how modern art has become a self-contained world, where spirit has claimed everything. I realized that in our time, we understand everything because we do everything for ourselves, probing at the edges of language, yet finding no answers in the unfamiliar world outside.\n[2004-01-09 13:15:00] Håvik city center office | I thought that in that beam of light, we must have seen the ambiguous and strange figure of death stepping in—and yet it had always already been within this world.\n[2004-01-28 22:00:00] Danderyd Hospital | Since there were no urgent complications and contractions hadn't started, I watched as the hospital sent us back home.\n[2004-01-28 22:05:00] On the way home | I knew that if the situation didn't improve, the doctor would induce labor via IV in two days. I thought that at least this way we had a clear deadline.\n[2004-01-28 23:00:00] Bedroom in the new apartment | After returning home, I collapsed onto the bed and slept like a stone. I noticed Nils Nils, too tense, slept very restlessly.\n[2004-01-29 14:00:00] Humle Park | The next day, Nils Nils and I watched several films, then took a long walk in Humle Park. I stretched out my arm and used the camera to take a selfie of the two of us. I saw the park behind us covered in snow. I noticed our faces pressed close together, glowing with vitality.\n[2004-01-29 16:30:00] Kitchen in the new apartment | I took a meal prepared by Nils Nils’s mother from the fridge and heated it up. The two of us ate this ready-made dinner together. I learned that Nils Nils’s mother had stored many ready-made meals in the fridge to help us through the first few weeks after the birth.\n[2004-01-29 17:00:00] new apartment kitchen | After finishing my meal, I stood in the kitchen brewing coffee. I heard a sudden low, trombone-like moaning sound coming from the living room.\n[2004-01-29 17:00:10] new apartment living room | I rushed into the living room and saw Nils Nils hunched over, clutching her stomach tightly with both hands. I noticed that when she lifted her face to look at me, there was clearly a faint smile on the corners of her mouth. I heard her let out a groaning 'wuwuwu.'\n[2004-01-29 17:00:30] new apartment living room | I saw her slowly straightening her body.\n[2004-01-29 17:00:40] new apartment living room | I heard her say to me, 'It's starting now. Can you keep track of the time? That way we'll know how far apart the contractions are.'\n[2004-01-29 17:00:50] new apartment living room | I asked her, 'Does it hurt?'\n[2004-01-29 17:00:55] new apartment living room | I heard her reply, 'A little, but not badly.'\n[2004-01-29 17:01:00] new apartment living room | I took out a pen and notebook to start recording. The second contraction came at five minutes and twenty-three seconds. Then we waited for the next one, which came another half hour later. I noticed it was just past five o'clock.\n[2004-01-29 20:00:00] new apartment | I learned that the contractions continued throughout the entire night, with varying intervals. I could feel her pain intensifying noticeably.\n[2004-01-29 22:09:40] Håvik | I knew he was sitting in the kitchen at that moment. I felt his physical presence as if within reach. Even across the distance, I could sense that familiar, loathsome feeling of inferiority—how I thought myself inferior to him in every way.\n[2004-01-29 22:09:50] Håvik | It struck me as rather strange that everything that happened that night seemed to prove my thoughts right.\n[2004-01-29 22:10:15] Kola's apartment | I stood in Kola's small apartment, with people scattered around chatting. I pushed open the door and left the room, stepping out onto the street. Before me lay a street blanketed in snow, glistening white. From inside the living room, loud music echoed in my ears. I knew the party belonged to Kola, Nils Nils’s friend.\n[2004-01-29 22:10:40] Kola's apartment | I learned that Nils Nils was then heavily pregnant. I thought this was probably the last party we could attend before the baby arrived and everything changed. So even though she looked exhausted, I realized she still wanted to stay a little longer.\n[2004-01-29 22:11:10] Kola's apartment | I was holding a glass of wine, talking with Thomas. As far as I knew, Thomas was a photographer and a friend of Karl Larsdal. I learned that Kola had met him through Thomas’s partner, Mary, who was a poet and had once taught Kola at the Biskops-Arnö Nordic Folk High School.\n[2004-01-29 22:11:40] Kola's apartment | I saw Nils Nils leaning back in a chair pulled away from the table, her belly making it hard to sit forward. I noticed she kept laughing, appearing happy, but I knew clearly that she had grown slightly withdrawn over the past few months—this radiance was likely very fleeting.\n[2004-01-29 22:12:10] Kola's apartment | I smiled slightly as I watched her get up and leave, then turned my attention back to Thomas. I heard Thomas talking about the genetics of red hair. I noticed there were redheads everywhere at the party.\n[2004-01-29 22:12:20] Kola's apartment | I noticed someone knocking on the door. A knocking sound reached my ears.\n[2004-01-29 22:12:25] Kola's apartment | I heard someone shouting loudly from outside: 'Kola! Kola!'\n[2004-01-29 22:12:30] Kola's apartment | I wondered silently—if that shouting voice belonged to Nils Nils?\n[2004-01-29 22:12:40] Kola's hallway | I got up and walked into the hallway.\n[2004-01-29 22:12:45] Kola's hallway | I felt the urgent knocking sound coming from inside the bathroom.\n[2004-01-29 22:12:50] Kola's hallway | I asked through the door, \"Is that you, Nils Nils?\"\n[2004-01-29 22:14:30] Kola's hallway | I watched them discussing strategies across the locked door, noticing that Nils Nils was struggling to follow instructions, but unfortunately the door remained tightly shut, completely unresponsive. I heard them constantly talking back and forth on either side of the door.\n[2004-01-29 22:15:15] Kola's hallway | I saw a crowd of people packed in the corridor giving advice to Nils Nils, while Kola appeared flustered and extremely anxious. I heard Kola muttering repeatedly that Nils Nils was pregnant and we had to figure out something to do. I felt the apartment's atmosphere suddenly become both cheerful and excited, as everyone became aware of the situation at hand.\n[2004-01-29 22:16:00] Kola's hallway | While waiting for the locksmith, I stayed standing by the door. I talked through the door to Nils Nils inside. I realized everyone had finally decided to call a locksmith. I felt deeply uncomfortable, sensing that everyone could hear my conversation and that they all saw through my helplessness.\n[2004-01-29 22:16:10] Kola's hallway | I asked myself inwardly—couldn't I just kick the door open and rescue her? It seemed like such a simple and effective solution.\n[2004-01-29 22:16:25] Kola's hallway | I hesitated, thinking I'd never kicked down a door before and didn't know how sturdy this one really was. I worried that if I threw all my strength into it and failed, I'd look utterly foolish in that moment.\n[2004-01-29 22:16:35] Kola's hallway | I saw the locksmith arrive half an hour later. He opened his toolkit on the floor in front of everyone and began fiddling with the lock repeatedly.\n[2004-01-29 22:16:40] Kola's hallway | I watched him try one tool after another, yet that damn lock wouldn’t budge at all. Before me stood a small, thin man wearing glasses, with a clearly balding spot on his head. I noticed he remained silent toward the crowd gathered around him.\n[2004-01-29 22:16:55] Kola's hallway | I saw him finally stop what he was doing and give up. I heard him tell Kola helplessly that it was no use—he couldn't open this door.\n[2004-01-29 22:22:05] Kola's hallway | Her voice came to my ears: \"It's me. I think the door lock is stuck. Can you call Kola for me? There must be some little trick to open it.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:22:20] Kara's living room | I stepped into the living room and gently tapped Kara on the shoulder. I noticed she was holding a food tray in one hand and a wine glass in the other.\n[2004-01-29 22:22:25] Kara's living room | I said to Kara, \"Nils Nils is locked inside the bathroom.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:22:35] Kara's living room | I saw her quickly put down the cup and plate and rush out hurriedly. I heard her exclaim in shock, \"Oh no!\"\n[2004-01-29 22:47:40] Kara's hallway | I heard Kara anxiously ask, \"So what should we do now? She could go into labor at any moment!\"\n[2004-01-29 22:47:45] Kara's hallway | I saw the locksmith simply shrug helplessly.\n[2004-01-29 22:48:00] Kara's hallway | I heard him stare at his set of tools and suggest, \"You'll have to kick this door open.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:48:05] Kara's hallway | I silently weighed in my mind who should carry out the task of kicking down the door.\n[2004-01-29 22:48:10] Kara's hallway | I realized it had to be me. I thought that since I was Nils Nils’s husband, this responsibility couldn’t be avoided.\n[2004-01-29 22:48:15] Kara's hallway | I could feel my heart pounding nervously.\n[2004-01-29 22:48:30] Kara's hallway | I kept hesitating in my mind: Should I really do it? Was I about to step back and kick with all my strength under the eyes of all these people?\n[2004-01-29 22:48:40] Kola's hallway | I worriedly thought, what if the door doesn't budge at all? Or worse, what if the door flies open and hits Nils Nils?\n[2004-01-29 22:48:45] Kola's hallway | I thought about how she must find a hiding spot in that narrow bathroom corner.\n[2004-01-29 22:49:10] Kola's hallway | I tried to calm myself down, taking several deep breaths in succession. I realized it wasn't helping—deep inside, I was still trembling. I thought drawing attention in this situation would be suicidal, and if I failed, the scene would only become even more unbearable.\n[2004-01-29 22:49:15] Kola's hallway | I saw Kola anxiously scanning the crowd around her.\n[2004-01-29 22:49:25] Kola's hallway | I heard Kola shout, \"We need to kick the door open—who's doing it?\"\n[2004-01-29 22:49:40] Kola's hallway | I noticed the locksmith had already left, carrying his toolbox out the door. I thought that if the one who must act was destined to be me, then now was the moment I should step forward.\n[2004-01-29 22:49:45] Kola's hallway | I struggled internally to step forward, but in the end, I still didn't take that step.\n[2004-01-29 22:49:55] Kola's hallway | I heard Kola mention a name: \"Mikkel—he's a boxer.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:50:05] Kola's hallway | I saw her turn and search through the crowd, preparing to go into the living room to fetch the man named Mikkel.\n[2004-01-29 22:50:15] Kola's hallway | I suggested to Kola, \"I can go call him.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:50:40] Kola's hallway | I thought, this compromising way made it impossible for me to conceal the shame within. I realized I was openly admitting to him: as a husband, I didn't even have the courage to kick open that door myself, and could only humbly ask him, this strong boxer, to do it for me.",

I saw his tall figure standing by the window.\n[2004-01-29 22:51:05] Kola's living room | I went over and greeted him: \"Hello, Mick.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:51:10] Kola's living room | I saw him stop talking, turn his head, and look at me coldly.\n[2004-01-29 22:51:25] Kola's living room | I explained the current predicament to him: \"She's still locked in the bathroom. The locksmith couldn't open it. Can you kick the door down? Do you think you can?\"\n[2004-01-29 22:51:45] Kola's hallway | I saw him staring at me intently for a moment. Then I watched him put down his glass and walk into the hallway, and I followed silently behind him. I heard him reply sharply with just two words: \"Of course.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:51:55] Kola's hallway | I watched him stride toward the bathroom, while the guests around us tactfully cleared a path for him.\n[2004-01-29 22:52:00] Kola's hallway | I heard him ask through the door: \"Are you in there?\"\n[2004-01-29 22:52:05] Kola's hallway | I heard Nils Nils respond from inside: \"Yes.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:52:15] Kola's hallway | I heard him warn seriously: \"Stay as far away from the door as possible. I'm going to kick it now.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:52:20] Kola's hallway | null I heard Nils Nils reply softly, \"Okay.\" null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:52:35] Kola's hallway | I watched him hold his breath for a moment, then suddenly lift his foot and slam it hard against the door. I saw the tremendous force instantly crush the lock inward, sending countless splinters of wood flying in all directions. null null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:52:50] Kola's hallway | I saw Nils Nils finally emerge from the bathroom. null I heard scattered applause rising from the crowd around us. null null\n[2004-01-29 22:53:05] Kola's hallway | null I heard Kola say sympathetically, \"Poor thing, I'm so sorry you had to go through that, and...\" null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:53:15] Kola's hallway | I saw Mikke, having completed his task, turn and walk away from the scene. null null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:53:20] Kola's hallway | null I leaned close and whispered, \"Are you okay?\" null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:53:30] Kola's hallway | null I heard Nils Nils reply weakly, \"I'm okay, but I think we should go home now.\" null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:53:35] Kola's hallway | null I immediately answered, \"Of course.\" null null null\n[2004-01-29 22:54:00] Kola's living room | I saw two women in their thirties preparing to take the stage to recite poetry. null I noticed the music in the living room had been turned down; the atmosphere grew somewhat solemn, and their poems sounded both vivid and passionate. null null\n[2004-01-29 22:54:30] Kola's house | I handed my coat to Nils Nils and quickly put on my own, then hurriedly said goodbye to Kola and Thomas. null null null I felt a burning sense of shame churning inside me. Despite the embarrassment, I still had one last duty to fulfill—I had to go thank Mikke.\n[2004-01-29 22:54:50] Kola's living room | I struggled through the crowd of people listening to poetry readings and finally stopped in front of Mik, standing stiffly before him.\n[2004-01-29 22:55:00] Kola's living room | I said to Mik, \"Thank you so much—you saved her.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:55:10] Kola's living room | I saw him shrug his massive shoulders. I heard him casually reply, \"It was nothing.\"\n[2004-01-29 22:56:00] Taxi | I noticed that on the cab ride home, I could barely bring myself to look at Nils Nils. I kept thinking about how I had failed to step up and do what needed to be done, and my insides churned with guilt. I realized how cowardly I had been, letting someone else take on my duty, and it all came back to me with painful clarity. I cursed myself inwardly, feeling like a complete wretch.\n[2004-01-29 22:57:00] Bedroom | I saw us getting into bed together. I heard her ask me what was wrong. I confessed that I felt deeply ashamed for not having kicked open that door myself at the time.\n[2004-01-29 22:57:10] Bedroom | I saw her looking at me in surprise. I heard her say to me that she'd never thought about it that way, didn't understand why it should have been my responsibility to kick the door in—she didn't see me as that kind of rough person at all. I realized her perception of me was completely different from my own expectations of myself.\n[2004-01-29 23:00:00] New apartment bedroom | I saw that we went to bed at eleven. I noticed her contractions had started again. Her painful screams rang in my ears. The quiet stillness of the night around us was shattered by her screams.\n[2004-01-29 23:05:00] New apartment bedroom | I noticed I was lying beside her. I wanted so badly to help, but inside I felt utterly helpless, completely unsure of what to do.\n[2004-01-29 23:10:00] New apartment bedroom | I saw the midwife pull out a device and hand it to her. I knew the device was called a TENS unit, used for pain relief, equipped with conductive pads that could be placed on painful areas and connected to a control unit.\n[2004-01-29 23:15:00] New apartment bedroom | I tried helping her with the device for a while; I saw myself fumbling awkwardly among the tangle of wires and buttons, attempting to adjust the machine. I heard her scream in pain and shock, \"Turn this damn thing off! It's shocking me—do you enjoy that? Get it away!\" I comforted her, saying, \"No, no, let me try again—okay, this time it should be right.\"\n[2004-01-29 23:30:00] new apartment bedroom | I saw myself taking the device away and instead trying to massage her. I noticed that I applied specially bought massage oil onto my hands. I found that no matter how I massaged, she still felt uncomfortable. I realized I was getting neither the pressure nor the positioning right.\n[2004-01-30 00:00:00] new apartment bathroom | I knew she had always hoped to soak in a large bathtub filled with hot water in the hospital room to ease the pain. I understood that due to her water having broken, both hospital regulations and home conditions no longer allowed her to soak. I thought about how she had never gotten this wish fulfilled, and I felt sorrow for her.\n[2004-01-30 00:10:00] new apartment bathroom | I saw her sitting down in the bathroom. I noticed her showering herself with scalding hot water. I saw her body tensing up against the pain. I heard her groans and whimpers from the intense pain.\n[2004-01-30 00:15:00] new apartment bathroom | I saw myself standing there, watching her. I noticed that I was extremely exhausted, feeling somewhat dizzy under the bright lights. I was in a brightly lit bathroom, filled with steam. Looking at her in pain, I silently lamented that even walking over to her felt so difficult at this moment—let alone helping her bear the suffering.\n[2004-01-30 06:00:00] new apartment | I saw that we struggled until dawn before finally falling into uneasy sleep. About an hour later, I saw us deciding to head to the hospital. The sky was faintly lightening with early morning glow. I knew although our appointment was still six hours away, we had to go early due to the special circumstances. I understood that the admission threshold was usually when contractions came every three to four minutes.\n[2004-01-30 07:00:00] new apartment | I knew her contractions were coming roughly every fifteen minutes now. I realized she was already in unbearable pain. I thought that under these circumstances, it was impossible to even mention those rigid hospital admission rules to her.\n[2004-01-30 07:30:00] taxi | I saw us getting into another taxi, speeding along the highway toward Danderyd. Outside the window, the grayish morning light came into view, and the cold air crept in.",

    "text": "[2004-01-30 08:00:00] Danderyd Hospital | I saw Nils Nils undergoing a doctor's examination. I heard the medical staff tell us that the cervix had only dilated to two centimeters so far. I inwardly mused that to me, this sounded like it would be a long wait before real labor truly began.\n[2004-01-30 08:05:00] Danderyd Hospital | I saw Nils Nils enduring such immense pain, and I felt deeply shocked. I had originally thought everything would end quickly, but now I realized the situation was unfolding completely differently than expected.\n[2004-01-30 08:10:00] Danderyd Hospital | I saw the hospital admitting us and leading us into a patient room. I noticed that both I and Nils Nils looked disheveled and exhausted. Then I saw the nurse close the door and leave. I heard them say we should have gone home according to the rules, but they let us stay because there was an available room. The nurse’s final words echoed in my ears: 'Get some rest.'\n[2004-01-30 08:15:00] hospital room | I bent down and placed my bag on the floor, then turned my head to look at Nils Nils. I said to her, \"At least we've made it here.\" I asked, \"Are you hungry?\"\n[2004-01-30 08:15:10] hospital room | I saw her shake her head at me.\n[2004-01-30 08:15:20] hospital room | I heard her say to me, \"I need to take a shower. Are you coming?\"\n[2004-01-30 08:15:25] hospital room | I nodded at him in agreement.\n[2004-01-30 08:20:00] hospital bathroom | I saw us standing under the showerhead, holding each other. Suddenly, another wave of contractions began, and I saw her double over abruptly, gripping the wall handle tightly with both hands. That piercing, desperate scream rang in my ears again. Hot water flowed from the showerhead, pouring over our bodies.\n[2004-01-30 08:25:00] hospital bathroom | I saw myself stroking her back with my hand. I looked into the mirror and saw that both our eyes were filled with extreme exhaustion. Then I saw her straighten up. The mirror reflected our two hollow faces, drained by utter fatigue. I thought my touch felt more like an insult than comfort. I realized only we ourselves were holding on through this.\n[2004-01-30 08:30:00] hospital room | I saw us walk into the room, where Nils Nils put on the hospital gown. I noticed that as soon as I lay down on the sofa, I almost instantly fell asleep. The ward had grown slightly quieter.\n[2004-01-30 12:00:00] hospital room | I saw that several hours later, a small delegation of medical staff entered our room. I noticed they began preparing for delivery.\n[2004-01-30 12:10:00] hospital room | I saw the nurses preparing to administer injections. I noticed Nils Nils writhing in pain, struggling to break free, but she was firmly held down by the two experienced nurses. I saw the needle pierce her skin. I heard Nils Nils screaming wildly in unbearable agony from the pain-masking method: \"F***!!\" I knew this method was called 'sterile water injection,' which alleviates labor pain by injecting water under the skin. I understood she had chosen this because she insisted on avoiding chemical painkillers.\n[2004-01-30 12:15:00] hospital room | I saw her enduring such immense suffering, and tears welled up uncontrollably in my eyes. I inwardly lamented how painful it was to watch her suffer, yet I realized this might only be the beginning—the most difficult trials still lay ahead. I worried that given her endurance, the upcoming delivery would be even harder.\n[2004-01-30 12:30:00] hospital ward | I saw her sitting on the hospital bed wearing a white gown. I noticed the nurse inserting an IV cannula into her arm, connecting her via a thin plastic tube to a medicine bag hanging on a stand. Before me stood medical poles lined with transparent IV bags.\n[2004-01-30 12:35:00] hospital ward | I watched as they inserted a small probe into the fetus’s head due to the infusion. Wires led from Nils Nils to a monitoring machine, and soon, I saw the numbers on the screen begin to flicker. Before me were monitors flashing numbers, and in my ears came the sound of the fetal heartbeat. I learned that because of the infusion, they needed to closely monitor the fetus’s condition.\n[2004-01-30 12:40:00] hospital ward | I watched the waveform on the monitor spike sharply with each contraction. In addition, I saw the machine continuously printing out paper strips, each tracing the same pattern. I saw a belt strapped around Nils Nils, connected by a long wire to another monitor. I noticed the numbers on this monitor beginning to flash and shift.\n[2004-01-30 12:41:00] hospital ward | I silently marveled—this scene looked as if they were preparing to launch her into space.\n[2004-01-30 12:45:00] hospital ward | I watched the probe inserted into the fetus’s head and noticed Nils Nils screaming again. I also saw the midwife gently pat her cheek. I stood there, stunned by the sudden flurry of activity around me. I wondered—why were they treating her like a child? I pondered this while remaining helplessly still.\n[2004-01-30 12:46:00] hospital ward | I speculated—was it because of the letter she had written to the hospital? I recalled that letter was probably lying in the nurses’ station right now. I remembered her writing that although she was strong-willed and full of hope, she still needed much support and encouragement.\n[2004-01-30 12:50:00] hospital ward | I saw Nils Nils’s gaze meet mine through the tangle of arms and tubes, and I saw her smile—I smiled back. I watched the serious, dark-haired midwife teach me how to read the monitor. I heard the midwife tell me that the baby’s heartbeat was especially important, and to press the button to call them if it showed sharp fluctuations. She reassured me not to be afraid if the reading dropped to zero—it was likely just a poor connection.\n[2004-01-30 12:55:00] hospital ward | I didn’t ask how long it would take—I only nodded. After saying this, I watched them leave. I heard her tell me she would check on us regularly. I thought—were we really going to be left alone here? I wanted to ask, but in the end, I said nothing.\n[2004-01-30 13:30:00] hospital ward | I saw the intervals between contractions begin to shorten shortly after. I watched her scream and writhe, constantly shifting positions, clearly agitated and restless. From Nils Nils’s reactions, I judged the intensity to be far greater now. I realized she was searching for a way to escape the pain. I felt something primal, almost animalistic, within it all.\n[2004-01-30 13:35:00] hospital ward | I saw the contraction pass, and she slowly grew quiet.\n[2004-01-30 13:35:05] hospital room | I heard her say weakly to me, \"I don't think I can make it, Grete Lundnes.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:10] hospital room | I heard myself reassure her, \"No, there's no danger. It hurts, but there's no danger.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:15] hospital room | I heard her cry out, \"It hurts! It fucking hurts!\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:20] hospital room | I heard myself reply, \"I know.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:25] hospital room | I heard her ask me, \"Can you massage me?\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:30] hospital room | I heard myself answer, \"Yes.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:35] hospital room | I saw her sit up and reach out to grab the bed rail.\n[2004-01-30 13:35:40] hospital room | I asked, \"Here?\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:45] hospital room | I heard her tell me, \"Lower.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:35:50] hospital room | I noticed a curve on the screen beginning to rise.\n[2004-01-30 13:35:55] hospital room | I heard myself say, \"It feels like it's coming.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:36:00] hospital room | I heard her cry out, \"Oh no, not yet.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:36:05] hospital room | I saw Nils Nils crying out, constantly shifting positions, moaning, changing position again and gripping the armrests with all her strength. I noticed the curve beginning to drop, the pain gradually subsiding. Before my eyes, the curve on the screen rose like a tsunami. I observed that as the pain subsided, the fetal heartbeat strengthened significantly.\n[2004-01-30 13:38:00] hospital room | I saw Nils Nils collapse, utterly exhausted.\n[2004-01-30 13:38:05] hospital room | I asked, \"Did the massage help?\"\n[2004-01-30 13:38:10] hospital room | I heard her reply briefly, \"No use.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:38:15] hospital room | I made up my mind—if the heartbeat still didn't recover after the next contraction, I would call them over.\n[2004-01-30 13:38:20] hospital room | I heard her say to me in despair, \"I can't take it anymore.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:38:25] hospital room | I heard myself encourage her, \"You can do it—you're doing great.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:38:30] hospital room | I heard her say to me, \"Cover my head.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:38:35] hospital room | I reached out and placed my hand on her forehead.\n[2004-01-30 13:40:00] hospital room | I saw her straighten her body, heard her sobbing, groaning, and cries, then watched her collapse backward again. I reached out and pressed the button, noticing a red sign above the door beginning to flash. I said, \"Here we go again.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:00] hospital room | I saw the midwife appear in front of me. I told the midwife, \"The heart rate reading is very high.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:10] hospital room | I watched her nod at me. I heard her reply, \"Yes, we need to slow down the medication a bit. Maybe it's too fast.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:15] hospital room | I saw her walk toward Nils Nils.\n[2004-01-30 13:42:20] hospital room | I heard the midwife ask, \"How are you doing?\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:25] hospital room | I heard Nils Nils say, \"It hurts like hell.\" Then I heard her follow up, \"Will it take much longer?\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:30] hospital room | I saw the midwife nod.\n[2004-01-30 13:42:35] hospital room | I heard her answer, \"Yes.\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:40] hospital room | I heard Nils Nils say in pain, \"I need something. I can't take it anymore. This won't work. Do you think I could use laughing gas?\"\n[2004-01-30 13:42:45] hospital ward | I heard the midwife say to her, 'It's a bit early; the effect will gradually wear off. Better to wait a little longer before using it.'\n[2004-01-30 13:42:50] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils insist, 'But this won't do. I need it now! This is unbearable!'\n[2004-01-30 13:42:55] hospital ward | I heard the midwife soothe, 'We have to wait a little longer, okay?'\n[2004-01-30 13:43:00] hospital ward | I saw Nils Nils nod, then watched as the midwife turned and left.\n[2004-01-30 14:00:00] hospital ward | I watched her try various ways to ease the pain over the next hour, unable to escape wave after wave of contractions. I reached out to wipe the sweat from her brow, pressed my hand against her forehead, and occasionally rubbed her back. From my observation, things remained largely the same during that next hour. I found the scene almost unbearable to witness. I thought how little I could actually do, and felt helpless.\n[2004-01-30 16:00:00] hospital ward | Before me was the silent descent of darkness outside the window, with heavy snow falling. I knew it was already four o'clock. As far as I knew, Marivik Lund had taken about twenty hours to deliver Ylva. I mused inwardly that an hour and a half had already passed. I reminded myself that childbirth was still in its early stages, something I had mentally prepared for.\n[2004-01-30 16:30:00] hospital ward | I heard a knock on the door, then saw the serious-looking midwife with black hair walk in.\n[2004-01-30 16:30:05] hospital ward | I heard her ask us, 'How are you doing?'\n[2004-01-30 16:30:10] hospital ward | I watched Nils Nils arch her back and turn her head. I heard her shout with all her strength, 'I want nitrous oxide!'\n[2004-01-30 16:35:00] hospital ward | I watched the midwife pause in thought, then nod and leave. A moment later, I saw her return to the bedside pulling a stand with two steel canisters hanging from it. I watched her fiddle with it for a few minutes, then hand a mask to Nils Nils.\n[2004-01-30 16:35:10] hospital ward | I said to the midwife, \"I wish I could do something too, like massage. Can you tell me where it would help most?\"\n[2004-01-30 16:36:00] hospital ward | At that moment, I noticed another contraction beginning. I saw Nils Nils press the mask to her face and greedily inhale the nitrous oxide, observing how she writhed her lower body in pain. I felt the midwife guide my hands to the base of her lower back.\n[2004-01-30 16:36:10] hospital ward | I heard the midwife instruct me, \"Right here, I think. Is that okay?\"\n[2004-01-30 16:36:15] hospital ward | I answered her, \"Yes.\"\n[2004-01-30 16:36:20] hospital ward | I rubbed some oil onto my hands. I watched the midwife close the door behind her as she left. I noticed myself placing one hand over the other, using the heels of my palms to press firmly on her lower back.\n[2004-01-30 16:36:30] hospital ward | I heard her muffled cries from beneath the mask. I heard her shout loudly, \"Yes!\" Her voice came through the mask, muffled but insistent: \"That's it! Yes! Yes! Yes!\"\n[2004-01-30 16:38:00] hospital ward | I saw the contraction gradually subside, noticing she turned her head toward me. I heard her say to me, \"Nitrous oxide is amazing.\"\n[2004-01-30 16:38:05] hospital ward | I briefly replied, \"Good.\"\n[2004-01-30 17:00:00] hospital ward | I saw that when contractions returned afterward, she behaved completely differently—no longer trying to escape the pain. I watched her stand up gripping the bed rails, shifting her hips back and forth, alternating between resting and pushing. I noticed the midwife come in and speak to me as if Nils Nils weren't even present. I saw her nod after receiving water and cloths. I heard Nils Nils call out in an unnaturally loud voice, \"Water!\" or \"Cloth!\" I heard her whisper a quiet \"Thanks!\" once she got them. I felt she seemed like a powerful wild animal. I thought she had completely disappeared into herself, entirely focused on confronting the pain. This sensation gave me a strange sense of reality.\n[2004-01-30 17:10:00] hospital ward | I kept my eyes fixed on the monitor, pressing with all my strength to massage her, while also watching the fetal heartbeat. Outside the window, thick darkness of night filled my view, with snowflakes drifting down. In my ears echoed Nils Nils’s heavy breathing as she inhaled nitrous oxide, and her roaring during the strongest contractions. I noticed the monitor beeping continuously. I marveled inwardly at what a strange afternoon and evening this had been. I thought that right now, numbers, graphs, massage oil, breaths, roars, and the lower back were everything.",

I thought that although it felt as though time no longer passed, it was still moving forward objectively. I realized only something out of the ordinary could pull me out of this state.\n[2004-01-30 17:20:05] hospital room | I saw a nurse walk in. I heard the nurse ask if everything was going well. I suddenly realized it was already five twenty.\n[2004-01-30 18:35:00] hospital room | I saw another nurse enter. I heard the nurse ask if I wanted something to eat. I noticed it had suddenly become six thirty-five.\n[2004-01-30 18:35:05] hospital room | I heard myself reply, 'Eat?' I remembered I had never heard of such a thing before.\n[2004-01-30 18:35:10] hospital room | I heard the nurse say to me, 'Yes, you can choose between vegetable lasagna and regular lasagna.'\n[2004-01-30 18:35:15] hospital room | I heard myself answer, 'Oh, great, regular lasagna then. Thank you.'\n[2004-01-30 18:40:00] hospital room | I saw the nurse close the door and leave. I pressed on Nils Nils's lower back with all my strength. I saw the monitor line dip, and since she hadn't yet removed her mask, I carefully took it off. I saw her sitting there unresponsive, her gaze blank, sweat dripping from her forehead. It seemed as if Nils Nils didn't notice anyone's presence at all; another wave of contractions had arrived.\n[2004-01-30 19:00:00] hospital room | I saw the door open and the nurse place a tray on the table. I heard continuous, muffled cries coming from beneath the mask tightly pressed against her face. The next contraction had already begun. I noticed it was now seven o'clock.\n[2004-01-30 19:05:00] hospital room | I saw Nils Nils nod at me. As soon as I lifted my hands from the massage, she roared. I pressed the button to call the previous nurse to take over. I stopped massaging, watched the nurse continue working, then seized those two minutes to quickly shovel noodles into my mouth with a fork before resuming the massage. I asked Nils Nils if I could eat. I heard her shout, 'No, don’t!' I heard the nurse say, 'Of course you can.' Then I heard Nils Nils scream, 'No, I want Grete Lundnes! I want Grete Lundnes! This is too light!' I saw Nils Nils regain her usual rhythm.\n[2004-01-30 20:00:00] hospital room | I saw the midwife walk in, turn Nils Nils onto her side without hesitation, and check how many fingers dilated she was. I heard Nils Nils's scream—a full-force, uncompromising cry. All I saw was the cycle of contractions, nitrous oxide, massage, and rest—nothing else. I felt this was a different kind of scream.\n[2004-01-30 20:30:00] hospital room | I watched her get up again. null null null I saw that she had found her own rhythm, as if detached from this world.

I realized that in just a few hours, we would truly have a child.\n[2004-01-30 22:05:00] hospital room | null null null null I thought that although the thought had flashed by, everything before me still returned to charts, numbers, touch, lower back, rhythm, and those cries.\n[2004-01-30 23:00:00] hospital room | I saw the door open, and an elderly midwife walked in, followed by a young girl. I saw the woman lean close to Nils Nils's face and introduce herself. I saw Nils Nils nod and look for the intern's presence. I heard the midwife praise Nils Nils for doing well and ask if she could bring in an intern. I heard the midwife comfort her, saying it would soon be over, and say she wanted to examine her. I saw their faces extremely close, only two or three centimeters apart. null null\n[2004-01-30 23:02:00] hospital room | I saw Nils Nils nod again.

I realized it was already eleven o'clock—Nils Nils had been enduring this for eight hours straight.\n[2004-01-30 23:10:00] hospital room | I saw the midwife remove all the belts and wires. I heard the midwife say, \"We can take these off now.\" I saw her sitting there, no longer bound by monitors. I realized she was suddenly free. Looking at her body lying on the bed, I thought how the pain she was battling was no longer just waveforms and numbers on a screen, but something real happening inside her.\n[2004-01-30 23:10:05] hospital room | I remembered that I hadn't truly understood this before. Now I realized the pain was within her—she was fighting entirely on her own.

I heard her say, \"It's coming.\" I realized that sensation was rising from within her. I thought in that moment there was only her and what was inside her—no hospital, no monitors, no books or corridors—only her and the being within.\n[2004-01-30 23:15:00] hospital room | I saw the intern stay behind, wiping foreheads, handing water, offering chocolate bars. I saw Nils Nils grab the chocolate greedily. I heard the midwife say she'd be right back. I saw her white gown loosely wrapped around her, her hair disheveled, her body slick with sweat. I sensed she was nearing her breaking point. I noticed her impatience with rest—her contractions were coming much too close together now.\n[2004-01-30 23:20:00] hospital room | I saw the midwife return. She dimmed the lights. I watched Nils Nils lie down as the midwife gently stroked her face. Then I walked over to the window, and turned once more to look at her. I heard the midwife say, \"Lie down, rest a bit.\" I saw no cars on the road below, only heavy snow swirling around the streetlights. The room was silent. Looking at Nils Nils, I thought she seemed to have fallen asleep.\n[2004-01-30 23:25:00] hospital room | I saw the midwife give me a small smile. I watched her take hold of one of Nils Nils’s arms and help her sit up.

I heard that drawn-out, heart-wrenching cry, as if it would never subside. I realized something unusual was happening, different from before, but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was. I wondered if the nitrous oxide seemed to have lost its effect.\n[2004-01-30 23:28:00] hospital ward | I saw the pain recede and Nils Nils collapse weakly. I noticed the midwife wiping the sweat from her forehead, praising her as a good girl. I heard the midwife ask, 'Do you want to touch your baby?'\n[2004-01-30 23:28:10] hospital ward | I saw Nils Nils lift her face toward the midwife, slowly nodding, then kneel upright. I noticed the midwife take her hand and guide it between her legs.

I silently mused that somehow, massage no longer seemed to help.\n[2004-01-30 23:30:10] hospital ward | I saw her gripping the baby’s head with one hand, her whole body shifting forward, and I heard her raw, guttural scream ringing in my ears.\n[2004-01-30 23:30:15] hospital ward | I heard the midwife say, 'The head is out—just one more push. Push hard.'\n[2004-01-30 23:30:20] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils ask urgently, \"The head's out?!

I heard the midwife say, \"Come over here, stand right here.\"\n[2004-01-30 23:30:50] hospital ward | I heard the midwife say, \"One more time. Push now, good girl. Push.\" I marveled inwardly—tears filled my eyes at that moment.\n[2004-01-30 23:31:00] hospital ward | I saw the baby slide out of her body, like a little seal, plopping into my hands.\n[2004-01-30 23:31:05] hospital ward | I screamed wildly, \"Ohhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!\"\n[2004-01-30 23:31:10] hospital ward | I felt the tiny body warm and slippery in my hands, nearly slipping away, but the young intern helped steady it. I lifted the small form and held it toward her as she pressed it against her chest. I noticed Nils Nils saw me for the first time in hours—she smiled. I wept aloud with joy. I heard Nils Nils ask, \"She's out? She's out?\" I answered, \"Yes.\"\n[2004-01-30 23:32:00] hospital ward | I opened my mouth and asked, \"What is this?\"\n[2004-01-30 23:32:05] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Girl, Grete Lundnes. It's a girl.\"\n[2004-01-30 23:35:00] hospital ward | I saw her hair was long and black, stuck to her scalp, her skin pale gray as if waxed. A scream rang by my ear—it was my daughter’s voice. I felt everything around me had come to a standstill, and all was dark. I thought to myself, I had never heard such a sound before—like stepping onto the peak of the world. I thought, we’re all here, and this little baby is that beam of light.\n[2004-01-30 23:40:00] hospital ward | I saw them help Nils Nils onto the bed, as she found a more comfortable position to lie down. I noticed the little girl lifting her head and looking at us. Before my eyes, the girl’s skin began to turn red.\n[2004-01-30 23:41:00] hospital ward | Her eyes came into view—like two black lamps.\n[2004-01-30 23:42:00] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils murmur, \"Hi... sweetie...\"\n[2004-01-30 23:43:00] hospital ward | I saw the baby lift one arm, then let it fall, then lift the other, stretch it out slightly, then let it drop again. I thought to myself, the movement was like that of a reptile—like a crocodile or a monitor lizard.\n[2004-01-30 23:44:00] hospital ward | Those two black eyes were staring straight at Nils Nils.\n[2004-01-30 23:45:00] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils say tenderly, \"Yes, I’m your mom. This is your dad! Can you see us?\"\n[2004-01-30 23:50:00] hospital ward | I gazed at this sudden new life, watching as the two women began tidying up around us. I noticed both Nils Nils and the baby were covered in blood. I smelled a sharp, metallic odor coming from both of them, making every breath feel unfamiliar.\n[2004-01-31 00:00:00] hospital ward | I saw Nils Nils bring the girl close to her breast, and I noticed the little girl was straining to look at us. I saw the midwife walk in carrying a tray of food, a glass of apple juice, and a Mochengdao flag. I watched them take the baby to measure and weigh her; I heard the child's cries, but I saw she quieted as soon as she was placed back against her chest. I silently marveled—this flawless tenderness in every gesture of the child was a completely new experience for me.\n[2004-01-31 00:10:00] hospital ward | Looking at the child before me, I asked, “Is this Vanja?”\n[2004-01-31 00:10:05] hospital ward | I noticed Nils Nils was staring intently at me. I heard her reply, “Of course she is, can’t you tell?”\n[2004-01-31 00:10:10] hospital ward | I turned to look at Nils Nils again. I whispered to the baby, “Hi, little Vanja.” I remarked that she resembled something we’d once found in the forest.\n[2004-01-31 00:10:15] hospital ward | I saw Nils Nils nod at me. I heard her affectionately call her, “Our little monster.”\n[2004-01-31 00:30:00] hospital ward | I saw the midwife approach the bedside. I heard the midwife tell us it was time to go to our own room, and suggest we might want to dress the baby.\n[2004-01-31 00:30:05] hospital ward | I noticed Nils Nils was staring at me. I heard her ask me, “Will you come?”\n[2004-01-31 00:35:00] hospital ward | I nodded, gently lifted the tiny, fragile body to the foot of the bed, took out her sleepwear from the bag, and began dressing her with infinite care. I heard her crying beside me in that strange little voice.\n[2004-01-31 00:40:00] hospital ward | I heard the midwife compliment Nils Nils, saying she really knew how to give birth, and jokingly added she should have many more.\n[2004-01-31 00:40:05] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils thank her and respond that she thought it was the finest compliment she'd ever received.\n[2004-01-31 00:40:10] hospital ward | I heard the midwife continue musing that when you think about how the child got such a start, it would benefit her for life.\n[2004-01-31 00:40:15] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils retort, 'Really?'\n[2004-01-31 00:40:20] hospital ward | I heard the midwife affirm that it definitely mattered. She congratulated us and wished us good night, mentioning she’d probably stop by again tomorrow morning, though she couldn’t be sure.\n[2004-01-31 00:40:25] hospital ward | I heard Nils Nils repeatedly thank her, exclaiming how wonderful they had been.\n[2004-01-31 00:45:00] hospital corridor | I saw Nils Nils staggering down the corridor toward the room, and I followed closely beside her. I held Vanja tightly in my arms, noticing her eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling.",

    "text": "[2004-01-31 00:50:00] new hospital room | I saw that as soon as we entered the room, we turned off the lights and went to bed. I noticed Nils Nils kept putting Vanja to her breast, but the baby didn't seem very interested. I heard the two of us talk for a long time, discussing everything that had just happened.\n[2004-01-31 01:30:00] new hospital room | I reassured Nils Nils, saying, 'From now on, you'll never have to fear anything again.'\n[2004-01-31 01:30:05] new hospital room | I heard Nils Nils respond that she felt the same way.\n[2004-01-31 02:00:00] outdoors downstairs from hospital | I noticed they had both finally fallen asleep. I took the elevator downstairs, smoked a cigarette, and called Mom. I heard myself say to Mom, 'Hi, it's me, Grete Lundnes.' I felt still awake and restless, convinced I had to do something. Maybe it was because I hadn't done anything before—that must have been the reason.\n[2004-01-31 02:01:00] outdoors downstairs from hospital | I heard Mom quickly ask how things were going and whether we were still at the hospital.\n[2004-01-31 02:01:10] outdoor area downstairs at the hospital | I told my mother we had a girl. I noticed my voice cracking.\n[2004-01-31 02:01:20] outdoor area downstairs at the hospital | I heard my mother exclaim, 'Oh my, oh my,' saying she couldn't believe it was a girl, and urgently asked about Nils Nils.\n[2004-01-31 02:01:30] outdoor area downstairs at the hospital | I told her everything was fine, quite good indeed.\n[2004-01-31 02:01:40] outdoor area downstairs at the hospital | I heard my mother congratulate me, marveling that this was truly wonderful.\n[2004-01-31 02:01:50] outdoor area downstairs at the hospital | I agreed with her, but said I just wanted to let her know first, and we could talk more tomorrow. I admitted I probably couldn't say much now.\n[2004-01-31 02:02:00] outdoor area downstairs at the hospital | I answered my mother with 'Of course.' After hanging up, I dialed the phone number of Nils Nils's mother. I heard my mother say she understood, and asked me to send her regards and congratulations to Nils Nils.\n[2004-01-31 02:05:00] hospital parking lot downstairs | I noticed she cried when I told her the news. I lit another cigarette and said the same thing again. After hanging up, I called Henrik Inge, then lit another cigarette. I paced back and forth in the parking lot, holding the phone to my ear. I was in a parking lot bathed in dim yellow light. Even though I knew the temperature must have been below minus ten degrees, I was only wearing a shirt, yet felt warm all over. I thought talking to Henrik Inge would be easier, so I chatted with him for a few minutes.\n[2004-01-31 02:15:00] hospital parking lot downstairs | I put away the phone and began walking up and down the corridor. I lit another cigarette, took two puffs, then threw it away, and ran toward the main entrance. I aimlessly stared at everything around me. I wanted to share my inner feelings with someone, but found no one. I kept thinking—they are upstairs right now, both of them!\n[2004-01-31 02:30:00] new hospital ward | I saw Nils Nils sleeping soundly, the little one lying on her chest. I watched them for a while, then took out my notebook, turned on the lamp, and sat down in the chair. I had wanted to write something about all this, but realized it was a foolish idea—I simply couldn't put pen to paper.\n[2004-01-31 02:45:00] hospital TV room | I went to the TV room and pinned a pink thumbtack onto the wall chart that recorded all the babies' birth dates. As far as I knew, girls were marked with pink on the chart, boys with blue. I remembered this, and felt that the pink thumbtack represented the lovely Vanja.\n[2004-01-31 03:00:00] hospital/outdoor | After walking up and down the corridor for a while, I took the elevator downstairs and smoked two cigarettes before returning upstairs to lie on the bed. I felt as if my heart had suddenly opened completely, able to embrace everything. I realized the world I was in was full of meaning, and marveled at how anyone could possibly fall asleep in such a state.\n[2004-01-31 04:00:00] new hospital ward | I felt myself finally drift off to sleep.\n[2004-02-10 10:00:00] hospital/parking lot | I saw everything as so fresh and fragile that even dressing her became a major task. I noticed Helene waiting for us downstairs in her car, and watched as it took us half an hour just to get the baby ready, before I carried her out of the elevator. I heard Helene burst out laughing: \"In this freezing cold, you're not seriously thinking of taking her out dressed like that?\" I thought to myself, oh no, we hadn't thought of that at all.\n[2004-02-10 10:30:00] parking lot | I saw Helene wrapped tightly in her down jacket, and noticed we hurried across the parking lot. I watched myself carrying the child seat in one hand. I saw Vanja swaying back and forth in the car seat.\n[2004-02-10 11:00:00] new apartment | I saw Nils Nils sitting there holding Vanja, crying. I noticed myself constantly moving around the apartment, busy cooking, washing, or running errands, trying to keep myself in constant motion. I realized we were truly on our own now. I felt an uncontrollable restlessness and urgency, and found I couldn't sit still.\n[2004-02-10 11:00:00] new apartment | I felt the light had not left us, nor had the silence vanished. I seemed to see a wall of peace rising up around us. I observed that Nils Nils simply wanted to sit quietly, holding the child against his chest. I thought to myself, this is truly extraordinary.\n[2004-02-15 10:00:00] Håvik | I knew he had volunteered as a human shield in Baghdad, and returned to Håvik with tapes full of interviews. I understood he had been somewhat angry with me for some reason before, though I still don't know exactly why. I heard that Karl Larsdal had conducted interviews in Baghdad, and felt amused—yes, that's just like him. I realized we had reconciled our friendship.\n[2004-02-20 10:00:00] new apartment/Oxhøg writing cabin | I watched myself spend ten days in calm and serenity. I noticed I had resumed writing, going to the Oxhøg writing cabin to work on 'Ezekiel'. I felt that inner, unstoppable restlessness. Looking at my little family, I thought: this is my little family—this feeling filled me with deep happiness.\n[2004-03-01 09:00:00] new apartment | I noticed myself beginning to manage the new routines brought on by having a child. I learned that Nils Nils was anxious about being left alone with the child. I knew we needed money, and that the novel had to be published by autumn. I realized I must fully commit myself to writing.\n[2004-03-01 10:00:00] Oxhøg writing cabin | I thought to myself, writing a novel about sandals and camels—this really won't work.\n[2004-03-01 11:00:00] Oksfjord Office | I saw myself writing something down in my notebook. I recalled having written in my notes thoughts like 'the Bible reappears in Leivik.' I realized these ideas were difficult to handle for a novel, but I decided to start writing anyway.\n[2004-03-05 15:00:00] New Apartment | I wrote about Cain hammering at the rocks in the twilight. I watched Nils Nils sitting in a chair listening as I read aloud, and I noticed the look of appreciation on her face. I heard myself ask Nils Nils if I could read it to her, and tell her I thought it was terribly silly. I heard her say to me, 'Oh come on, just read it!' After reading, I kept hearing her praise: 'Fantastic, absolutely fantastic—you must keep writing.'\n[2004-03-15 10:00:00] Halvik | I recalled that spring when I moved to Halvik and met Nils Nils. I felt the world suddenly open up, overwhelmed by an intense sense of fullness. I remembered being deeply in love, ready to embrace everything.\n[2004-04-01 10:00:00] Oksfjord Office | I watched myself keep writing in the Oksfjord office, continuing all the way to Vanya's baptism day.",

    "text": "[2004-05-15 12:00:00] Jølster | I watched the baptism ceremony take place in May, then noticed we went to Vidal’s summer house on Idøy. I knew the baptism was held at my mother’s place in Jølster.\n[2004-05-15 20:00:00] Halvik, Ridarøy | I saw futuristic trains passing through the Slussen district; I noticed the sun reddening the church steeple on Ridarøy. I smelled the fragrance of basil and the scent of freshly ripened tomatoes; I heard footsteps tapping on cobblestones in front of the Hilton Hotel. I recalled during those free days, I felt the surrounding world brimming with meaning. I remembered us sitting hand in hand on a bench, knowing only that our two-person world could last forever.\n[2004-05-26 14:00:00] Jølster | I took Vanya for a walk in the valley. I saw that Nils Nils kept expressing dissatisfaction with the house. I saw that Mom had renovated the living room for the celebration, but it still looked like a construction site. I learned we hadn’t originally planned to hold the naming ceremony here. I knew I’d need at least three days to clean up the house. I observed that Nils Nils became furious after arriving a few days early. Though I understood her anger, I found myself unable to agree with her.\n[2004-05-26 14:10:00] Valley Path | I heard Nils Nils shouting loudly in the valley: 'Sissel is narrow-minded, inhospitable, cold, and closed off. You don't understand your mother's true nature... you don't understand your mother at all.' I was in a sunlit green valley.\n[2004-05-26 14:11:00] Valley Path | I felt a sharp cramp in my stomach from anger. I inwardly sighed—whenever she erupted into what I saw as utterly unreasonable and almost mad rage, I always felt this way.\n[2004-05-26 14:12:00] Valley Path | I noticed we were pushing the stroller, nearly running along the valley path. I saw Vanya sleeping in the stroller.\n[2004-05-26 14:13:00] valley path | I heard myself say loudly, \"This is our daughter's naming ceremony—of course the house has to be cleaned!\" I went on, \"Mom has to work; she can't spend all her time on us.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:14:00] valley path | I heard Nils Nils retort, \"Can't you see? Every time we come back here, you have to work. She's taking advantage, and we never get to be alone together here.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:15:00] valley path | I heard myself snap back, \"We're alone together every day! We don't have anything except time alone together!\"\n[2004-05-26 14:15:30] valley path | I heard Nils Nils say coldly, \"She gives us no space at all.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:16:00] valley path | I heard myself challenge her, \"What did you say? Space? If anyone gave us space, it was her. Your mother never gave us space.\" I mentioned how she had said, when Vanya was born, that she didn't want anyone coming over.\n[2004-05-26 14:16:30] valley path | I saw Nils Nils fall silent, just gazing into the distance.\n[2004-05-26 14:17:00] valley path | I heard myself say to her, \"Of course Mom wants to come, Henrik Inge wants to come too... So what happened? Your mom came over when you invited her, and you actually said, 'Just Mom!'\" I sighed, saying how she could come, but my mom couldn't.\n[2004-05-26 14:18:00] valley path | I heard Nils Nils reply, \"But your mom hasn't even visited Vanya. Months have passed.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:18:10] valley path | I heard myself shout, \"What did you expect? I told her not to come!\"\n[2004-05-26 14:18:20] valley path | I heard Nils Nils say to me, \"Love, Grete Lundnes—love is something no refusal can stop.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:18:30] valley path | I heard myself blurt out, \"Oh my God!\"\n[2004-05-26 14:19:00] valley path | I saw that neither of us was speaking anymore.\n[2004-05-26 14:20:00] valley path | I heard Nils Nils say to me, \"Like yesterday, for instance. She stayed sitting with us the whole time, right up until we went to bed.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:20:10] valley path | I replied, \"So what?\"\n[2004-05-26 14:20:20] valley path | I heard her ask, \"Is this how my mother lives?\"\n[2004-05-26 14:21:00] valley path | I shot back, \"No, she goes to bed at eight if she thinks you want her to. She'll do anything for us when she's there, sure. But that goddamn doesn't mean it's some natural law. Ever since I left home, I've helped Mom with little things—painting the house, mowing the lawn, doing laundry. What's wrong with that now? What's wrong with helping out a bit? Huh? This time it's not even just for her—it's for us! It's our naming ceremony. Don't you get it?\"\n[2004-05-26 14:22:00] valley path | I heard Nils Nils say, \"You don't understand what this is really about. We haven't come here because you had work and I had to take care of Vanja. That's where we're wrong. Your mother isn't as innocent as you think—she has intentions, calculations.\"\n[2004-05-26 14:23:00] valley path | I thought, I've said everything I could, damn it. I feel like this whole situation is completely fucked up. I cursed inwardly—how the hell did I end up stepping in this giant pile of shit?\n[2004-05-26 14:30:00] valley path | I saw that we were walking and arguing, pushing Vanja asleep in her stroller, while I was debating whether or not to spend a few days cleaning my mother's house. I looked up—the sky was clear blue, the sun blazing high. On either side of the river rose steep cliffs, the water swollen with melting snow. All around me lay green pastures dotted with sheep. At the top, the Jostedal Glacier's ice tongue shimmered, the mountain peaks above tinged pale blue, streaked with large patches of snow. The air felt crisp. I felt the beauty of the landscape ache in my chest.\n[2004-05-26 14:35:00] valley path | I thought, her unreasonableness knows no bounds. Her ideas seem utterly meaningless to me. But then again, maybe I've gone too far now.\n[2004-05-26 14:36:00] valley path | I couldn't help but wonder inwardly: what was she really thinking?\n[2004-05-26 14:40:00] valley path | Oh, I realized it now—she had been alone with Vanya all day, from the moment I went to my study until I came home. I sensed how much she had longed for this small family gathering, this naming ceremony, out of her loneliness. And yet I only wanted to retreat into my study to write, especially since after six years of failure, I finally felt I was making progress and didn’t want to stop. I noticed how powerfully these feelings arose within me—they completely took hold of me.\n[2004-05-28 10:00:00] Loen | I stayed up the entire night writing a speech for my mother's birthday. I drove through the countryside, passing fjords, mountains, rivers, and farms. When I arrived in Loen, I stayed in the room with Nils Nils and Vanya and took a short nap. Before my eyes lay a picturesque scene: such deep blues, vivid greens, and brilliant whites. I felt the vastness of the space so intensely it startled me. Friday had finally arrived, and I felt a wave of fatigue. I reflected inwardly that in the past, landscapes were merely passing images; now, I could truly experience their beauty.\n[2004-05-28 15:00:00] Loen | I saw Nils Nils sleeping beside me, with Vanya resting on her chest. The sound of rushing river water reached my ears, along with the rising and falling noise of a tractor moving across a nearby field. Occasionally, I also heard faint sounds from the front of the house. Looking at Nils Nils asleep, I thought to myself that for her, the earlier quarrel had already vanished without a trace.\n[2004-05-28 15:05:00] Loen | I knew I had been through three long emotional relationships and had learned how to respond to conflict with irony and silence. I recalled my childhood, when I had no choice at all. I realized that only I could sulk for weeks on end, harboring resentment solely toward Nils Nils. I regarded this as part of adult life. Being with her seemed to bring me back to that emotionally unstable past, and this tension made life feel unbearable—only in books could I find peace.\n[2004-05-28 15:10:00] Loen | I thought: I'm thirty-five now, and I simply want as little inner turmoil and as little mental agitation as possible. I asked myself—surely I should be entitled to that? At the very least, shouldn't I have a chance?\n[2004-05-28 15:11:00] Loen | But in my view, things weren't like that at all.",

    "text": "[2004-05-28 18:00:00] on a stone outside the house | I sat on a stone outside the house smoking, flipping through the speech I had already written. I thought about how giving speeches felt to me like a plague. The mere idea of standing on stage made me unbearably nervous—I would feel paralyzed, even unable to walk. I realized this anxiety was actually a phase of neurosis, one that caused me pain and was hard to escape.\n[2004-05-28 18:30:00] on the road in Loen | I stood up and walked heavily down the road. The whole village lay before me. I saw fertile green fields, deciduous trees lining the riverbanks. The fjord lay calm, its waters a blend of blue and green. Across the water, farms perched high on the hillsides sparkled in the evening light. As the sun sank lower, the exposed mountain slopes turned dark blue, the sky remained clear. I noticed the first stars beginning to shimmer faintly in the night sky. Gazing at the landscape ahead, I thought to myself that all of this was beyond our comprehension.\n[2004-05-28 18:40:00] on the road in Loen | I pondered how this scene transcended human understanding. Though we often deceive ourselves into believing our little world is everything, honestly I asked myself—what role do we slaves really play within such a sublime vision?\n[2004-05-28 18:41:00] Lern Road | I thought, the answer is nothing.\n[2004-05-28 18:45:00] Lern Road | The stars shimmered above me, and I saw grass growing. I noticed the earth swallowing and erupting new life. I remarked to myself that the cycle of the earth’s devouring and growing happens outside of us—we aren’t truly part of it. I felt as aimless as a wave in the sea, merely one fragment among countless lives that grow and die.\n[2004-05-28 19:00:00] In front of the old house | I saw four cars emerge from the valley behind me—my mother’s guests had arrived. I walked toward the old house and watched them excitedly climb out of their vehicles. I observed as they went about arranging rooms. I could sense their excitement from having just seen the glacier. I knew the guests included my mother’s sisters, their husbands and children, as well as Inge and Vidar. From what I understood, the evening’s plan was to eat reindeer meat, drink, and listen to speeches.\n[2004-05-28 20:30:00] Living room of the old house | I saw Henrik Inge step up to the stage first. I watched him present the single-lens reflex camera we had jointly purchased, then begin his speech. I heard Henrik deduce in his speech that my mother had always been confident about photography but never owned a camera herself, which was why we gave her this gift. I felt so tense that I didn’t absorb a word he said—I was completely shut down by nerves.\n[2004-05-28 20:45:00] Living room of the old house | I saw it was my turn to go onstage. I sat there, unable to eat anything. I noticed that most people present were ones I’d known since childhood, watching me with kind expressions. I knew deep down that I couldn’t avoid this speech—after all, she was turning sixty today. I thought that as a son, I had to say something pleasant for her sake. Even though talking about love made me feel nauseous, I still had to stand up.\n[2004-05-28 20:46:00] Living room of the old house | I stood up. I felt everyone’s eyes on me. I focused all my willpower into my hands, trying to steady the speech in my grip and keep them from trembling.\n[2004-05-28 20:47:00] Living room of the old house | I looked at my mother and saw her giving me an encouraging smile. I began speaking: 'Dear Mom, I want to start by thanking you. I want to thank you because you’ve been such an incredible mother. And being such an incredible mother is just one of many things I know about you. But of course, expressing these things in the language we have isn’t always easy. It’s especially difficult here, because the qualities you possess aren’t always the kind that are easily seen.'\n[2004-05-28 20:48:00] Living room of the old house | I swallowed hard, glanced down at my glass of water. I decided not to reach for it, then looked up again at the eyes watching me.\n[2004-05-28 20:50:00] Living room of the old house | I continued my speech: 'There’s a Frank Capra film that hits the mark exactly. It’s called It’s a Wonderful Life, from 1946. It’s about a good man in a small American town who, at the beginning of the film, falls into crisis and wants to give up everything. Then an angel intervenes and shows him what the world would be like without him. I don’t think you need an angel to understand how important you are to us—but sometimes perhaps we do. You give everyone space to be themselves. Now, that might sound commonplace, but it’s not—in fact, it’s a very rare quality. And sometimes it’s hard to recognize. It’s not hard to see someone boasting about themselves, or judging others by their own standards. But you never boast, you never impose your standards: you accept people as they are, adapt to them. I think everyone here has experienced that firsthand.'\n[2004-05-28 20:51:00] Living room of the old house | A low murmur rose from the table beside me.\n[2004-05-28 20:55:00] living room of the old house | I went on, 'When I was sixteen or seventeen, that quality meant everything to me. We lived alone in Tvet, and though I think it was a tough time, I always felt you had faith in me—real confidence, not just a little bit. You trusted me. You allowed me to learn through my own experience. Of course, I didn't realize at the time what you were doing. I suppose I couldn't see you, or myself, clearly then. But now I can. And I want to thank you for that.' I recalled the days when I was sixteen or seventeen, living with my mother alone in Tvet.\n[2004-05-28 20:56:00] living room of the old house | As I spoke these words, I caught my mother's gaze, and suddenly my voice turned hoarse. I picked up my glass of water and gulped down a large mouthful, struggling to keep a smile on my face. I found it wasn't easy to force that smile. I sensed a wave of sympathy spreading around the table, but I felt awkward about what to do with it. I realized I only wanted to make a speech—not plunge into a sentimental abyss.\n[2004-05-28 21:00:00] living room of the old house | I heard myself continue at the table, 'Yes, now you're sixty. You haven't planned to retire—in fact, you've just finished your studies. These two things say something about who you are: first, that you're energetic, full of vitality, and curious about knowledge; second, that you never give up. This applies to your life as well, and to how you relate to others: things take time. Everything requires the time it needs. When I was seven and starting school, I didn't know how to understand that. On the first day, you drove me there—I remember it clearly—and you weren't quite sure of the way, but you were confident we'd manage. We drove through one residential area, then another. I sat in the car in my light-blue uniform, with my little backpack and combed hair. While we circled aimlessly around Rocky, my new classmates stood on the schoolyard and listened to the entire welcome speech. By the time we finally arrived, it was all over. I could tell countless similar stories. For instance, you once drove for kilometers completely lost—no exaggeration—through unfamiliar terrain, unaware you'd long left the roads near Bærum. Eventually you stopped on a narrow path fit only for tractors, at the dark, dead end of some remote valley. There are so many such incidents. Just recently, one week ago, on your sixtieth birthday, you invited colleagues over for coffee. They arrived, but you'd forgotten to buy coffee, so you all ended up sitting down to tea instead. Sometimes I think this absent-minded side of your personality is actually a prerequisite for your presence—during our conversations, and in your talks with others.'\n[2004-05-28 21:05:00] living room of the old house | I met her eyes again. I saw her facing me, smiling. At that moment, I felt my own eyes grow moist, and then I saw her stand up, as if she wanted to give me a hug. I cursed myself inwardly for being so foolish as to meet her eyes again. Seeing her coming toward me, I silently screamed: No, God no, not this.\n[2004-05-28 21:10:00] living room of the old house | I saw the guests applauding, and then I returned to my seat once more. I felt deep disgust toward myself. I thought that even if losing control created a good impression and strengthened the impact of my words, I still felt ashamed inside for showing such vulnerability.\n[2004-05-28 21:15:00] living room of the old house | I saw my mother’s older sister, Grete Lundnes, rise from her seat a few places away. I heard her speak a few words about growing older, accompanied by some playful boos from around the table. I thought her speech was lovely, full of warmth. I reflected quietly: after all, sixty is no longer forty.\n[2004-05-28 21:20:00] living room of the old house | As she was speaking, I saw Nils Nils walk in and sit beside me. I felt her hand rest gently on my arm. I nodded at her. I heard her whisper, 'Is everything still okay?' I leaned over and whispered back, 'Is she sleeping?' Then I saw Nils Nils nod and smile slightly.\n[2004-05-28 22:00:00] living room of the old house | I saw Grete Lundnes sit down, and then the next speaker rose. I noticed that Vidar and Inge seemed very happy. I watched Vidar chatting animatedly, quickly responding with anecdotes and opinions. I also saw Inge laughing, but she seemed somehow stuck in place. I knew that Vidar sometimes displayed signs of elderly rigidity at home, but none of that was evident today. From what I observed, Inge either couldn’t easily connect with strangers, or her mental state was overly excited.",

    "text": "[2004-05-29 10:00:00] Jølster | The next day, when we returned to prepare for the naming ceremony, I saw she was still carrying on as usual—preparing as much food as possible the night before. On the naming day itself, I watched her bustling about in the kitchen. From my observation, with more space around her, her behavior seemed less conspicuous. I knew she constantly worried there wouldn’t be enough food, feared the house door might be locked on the naming day leaving no time to host guests, or that she’d be alone in the kitchen unable to find the necessary tools.\n[2004-05-30 11:00:00] church | I saw the priest was a young woman. We stood around her by the baptismal font, and I watched Nils Nils holding Vanja. Before me was the image of water wetting Vanja’s little head.\n[2004-05-30 12:00:00] church | I saw that as soon as the ceremony ended, Inge left first, then I watched Berit Hansnes and her family rise and kneel at the communion rail. I also stood up and followed suit: I knelt before the rail, received a piece of bread on my tongue, drank the communion wine, accepted the blessing, then rose and returned to my seat. I felt the gaze of Mother, Sverre, Henrik Inge, and Karl Larsdal following me all the way. I realized their eyes held varying degrees of doubt.\n[2004-05-30 12:05:00] church | I kept asking myself: why did I do this?\n[2004-05-30 12:06:00] church | I secretly doubted myself: have I become a Christian?\n[2004-05-30 12:10:00] church | I bowed my head, walked down the aisle, and finally knelt at the communion rail. I knew that ever since my teens I had strongly opposed Christianity, that I was a genuine materialist at heart. I realized my earlier action had been purely impulsive. I felt I couldn't defend it before everyone's eyes, let alone claim to be a Christian. I felt a slight shame.\n[2004-05-30 12:15:00] church | I realized that so much had truly happened in recent years.\n[2004-05-30 12:20:00] church | I remembered talking with a priest when my father died—it had felt like a confession, and I told him everything. I realized that at the time, the funeral ritual had almost become something tangible. Recalling that moment, I felt how tightly the ritual had gripped me. I thought: yes, it truly transformed my father’s bitter, broken life into a dignified one.\n[2004-05-30 12:25:00] church | I realized that over the past year’s work, I had been reading the Pentateuch, the New Testament, and works by Rilke and others. I knew these texts carried a hymn-like solemnity. I knew the sacred had never been far away. I gradually came to understand that I wanted to explore the sacred. I realized this concerned flesh and blood, life and death. I felt these readings were leading me toward what has always been and will always remain.\n[2004-05-30 12:30:00] church | I silently reckoned that I had already thought about these things for a long time.\n[2004-05-30 12:35:00] church | I heard the priest asking questions about faith. At the time, I couldn’t tell her I was a Christian; I could only evade the question. I knew that because of my marital background, the priest had been somewhat reluctant when baptizing Vanya. I recalled the situation and felt a sense of hypocrisy, as if I were deceiving others to get my daughter baptized. I realized my act during communion might have been an attempt to redeem something, yet it ended up appearing even more insincere.\n[2004-05-30 12:36:00] church | I sighed inwardly: But still, the sacred.\n[2004-05-30 12:37:00] church | I silently recited in my heart: flesh and blood.\n[2004-05-30 12:38:00] church | I felt inwardly: this is the one truth underlying all things, unchanging amidst every change.\n[2004-05-30 12:40:00] church | I saw Berit Hansnes walk over and kneel down there. I also walked into the aisle and knelt on the ground. I felt he was a whole person, a good man. And deep inside, I longed: I want so badly to be a whole person, I want so badly to be a good man.\n[2004-05-30 13:00:00] steps of Jølster Church | I saw us standing on the church steps, taking a group photo of parents, children, godparents, and godmothers. Before my eyes lay the ancient stone steps of the church.\n[2004-05-30 13:00:30] steps of Jølster Church | To my knowledge, the baptismal dress Vanya is wearing today was also worn by her great-grandmother at her baptism—right here in Jølster.\n[2004-05-30 13:01:00] steps of Jølster Church | I saw my mother’s sisters, all gathered together, along with their children and grandchildren. I spotted Alfdis, Aafne, as well as Karl Larsdal, Christina, and Vidar and Ingrid among the crowd. I know that Alfdis and Aafne are two elder relatives especially dear to Nils Nils.\n[2004-05-30 13:05:00] outside Jølster Church | We were standing there when I saw Ingrid run up the hill. I watched her take the key from my mother, then turn and run back again. I realized my mother had been so distracted that the door indeed got locked. I knew Ingrid’s earlier worry hadn’t been unfounded.\n[2004-05-30 13:35:00] Nils Nils's mother's garden | When we arrived home half an hour later, I saw her growing anxious because she couldn't find some plates. Then I watched everyone celebrate in the garden. I sensed the weather was wonderful. The lake spread out before me, with mountains mirrored in its waters. Around me rose voices praising the food.\n[2004-05-30 17:00:00] Nils Nils's mother's house | But once all the meals were finished, I saw everyone take turns holding Vanya on their laps. I noticed Ingrid became idle, and then I saw her retreat to her room, staying inside without coming out. I wondered if perhaps this situation made her feel uncomfortable.\n[2004-05-30 17:30:00] Nils Nils's mother's house | Not until around five or half past, after the first guests had left, did I see Nils Nils go inside to look for her. I found she was asleep, almost impossible to wake. I knew she had been like this recently. It suddenly struck me how long it had been since I last really saw her.\n[2004-05-30 17:35:00] Nils Nils's mother's house | From what I understand, after she passes out completely, the first five to ten minutes upon waking she’s basically unable to communicate with anyone. I recalled how Nils Nils once told me how frightening this sight could be. I realized Nils Nils was suspecting this might have something to do with sleeping pills.\n[2004-05-30 17:45:00] Garden of Nils Nils's mother's house | I watched her almost stumble across the lawn toward the outside of the house. I noticed that when she sat down at that table, her laughter seemed slightly out of context. In the surrounding atmosphere, I sensed her laughter was slightly disconnected compared to others.\n[2004-05-30 22:00:00] Nils Nils's mother's house | After everyone had gone to sleep that night, I heard Nils Nils talk to me about it. Her voice, filled with worry, reached my ears as she said her mother seemed to be suffering but didn’t even know it herself—everything was suppressed, and though she wanted to communicate with her mother, she didn’t know where to begin. I learned that Ingeri’s condition was due to sleeping pills and the stress associated with the party. I knew she had cooked for twenty-five guests, and everything was new and unfamiliar to her. I thought she really looked worrying—clearly, something wasn’t right. I realized her mind seemed elsewhere; that overly excited voice and flushed face made me uneasy.\n[2004-05-30 23:00:00] Nils Nils's mother's house | I saw that when I encountered them again, her panic and anxiety had completely vanished. I noticed Vidar had also returned to his usual self.\n[2004-05-30 23:05:00] Outside Nils Nils's mother's house | I saw him standing there with his hands on his hips, gazing at the furnishings he had built himself. I noticed Nils Nils climbing up the hill, walking toward us. I heard the sound of a train coming from one side of the mountain, fading away, then rising again from the other side, growing louder and fuller.\n[2004-05-30 23:05:10] Outside Nils Nils's mother's house | I heard her shout loudly as soon as she saw us: \"Time for dinner!\"",

    "text": "[2004-05-31 07:30:00] Train station | I saw Vidar drive us to the train station. Ingeri, Nils Nils, and I traveled together. We arrived just moments before the train departed, and I realized I didn’t have time to buy a ticket. I knew Ingeri had a monthly pass, and Nils Nils’s round-trip ticket was sufficient for returning to Håvik.\n[2004-05-31 08:30:00] On the train | I sat by the window and took out a stack of newspapers to read. I saw Ingeri tending to Vanja, while Nils Nils sat beside her, looking out the window. I noticed the ticket inspector approaching us after several stops.\n[2004-05-31 08:30:05] On the train | I heard Ingeri point at me and say to the ticket inspector: \"He got on in Hønefoss.\"\n[2004-05-31 08:30:10] On the train | I was astonished in my mind: What? I thought—she’s actually covering for me to evade a ticket? I realized she was doing something I never would have expected.\n[2004-05-31 08:30:20] on the train | I locked eyes with the ticket inspector while speaking and fumbling in my pocket for change. I heard myself say to the ticket inspector, \"To Halviken, getting on at Håninge. How much?\"\n[2004-05-31 08:30:40] on the train | As far as I knew, I had always stuck to the principle of never taking unfair advantage—even returning money when a shop gave me too much change. I knew that fare evasion was the last thing I'd ever want to do. I thought about how I couldn't bring myself to confront Ingrid directly and say I'd boarded in Gränna, because I was afraid it would embarrass her.\n[2004-05-31 08:31:00] on the train | I took the ticket and change handed to me by the inspector and thanked him. I watched him disappear into the stream of morning commuters.\n[2004-05-31 08:35:00] on the train | I kept my head down, reading the newspaper. I felt furious, yet sighed inwardly and ultimately said nothing.\n[2004-05-31 09:15:00] Halviken Central Station | I saw that we had arrived at Halviken Central Station. I moved the stroller onto the platform and offered Ingrid to take her suitcase back to the office. I saw she seemed pleased, and I thought this would save her from dragging the suitcase around.\n[2004-05-31 09:30:00] Halviken streets | I said goodbye to them in the hall. Pulling the suitcase with one hand and carrying my laptop bag with the other, I walked quickly toward Dalar Street. I unlocked the door to the office. Before me lay the square with the fortress-like building of the Trade Union Alliance.\n[2004-05-31 09:35:00] the office | I knew the past from writing 'For Everything There Is a Season' was closing in on me from all sides. I silently marveled that this place had become so full of memories. I remembered how happy I had been back then.\n[2004-05-31 09:40:00] the office | I saw myself clearing space for the suitcase in the cabinet under the sink, then walking into the bathroom to urinate. I thought it would be best not to see that suitcase while working.\n[2004-05-31 09:42:00] office bathroom | I saw Ingrid's shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom. I noticed cotton swabs and dental floss in the trash bag. I grabbed the bottles and threw them into the kitchen trash can. I heard myself shout involuntarily, \"What the hell is going on!\"\n[2004-05-31 09:43:00] the office | I grabbed the garbage bag from the wastebasket. I bent down and pulled a small clump of her hair from the drain. With all my strength, I threw the hair into the bag, crumpled it up, and shoved it into the kitchen cabinet's trash bin. I heard myself roar, \"God damn it, will this never end?\" I angrily thought to myself that this was my office, the one place that was entirely mine, and even here I had been invaded.\n[2004-05-31 09:44:00] office | I silently made up my mind: then, go to hell.\n[2004-05-31 09:45:00] office | I turned on the computer and sat down at the desk, waiting for it to boot. I stared at the mark on the wooden floor, then looked toward the wall behind the sofa. I noticed the photo taped above the desk, and the anatomical charts behind me. Before me was the image of Jesus Christ wearing a crown of thorns on the wooden floor. I saw the night poster of Per Bakke on the wall behind the sofa. I noticed two photographs of Thomas hanging above the desk, and behind me, whale anatomy diagrams and intricate insect illustrations.\n[2004-05-31 09:50:00] office | I realized I couldn't write here anymore. I thought to myself that I wouldn't be able to produce anything new in this place.\n[2004-05-31 09:55:00] office | As far as I knew, I had a lecture to give Saturday morning. I understood it was part of a tradition honoring writers nominated for the Nordic Council Literature Prize. I remembered that I had accepted the invitation at the last moment. I thought about how this week’s work would revolve entirely around that speech. I realized the next three days would be consumed by this meaningless task.\n[2004-05-31 10:00:00] office | I sat there, filled with indifference toward the audience and the award—only wanting to write more books. I thought viciously that maybe I should publicly shit on the podium to humiliate the moment, then casually hand over the microphone to the next writer.\n[2004-05-31 10:15:00] office kitchenette | I saw myself deleting those words from the screen. I walked into the kitchenette and started boiling water, scooped two spoons of instant coffee into a cup, and finally poured in the hot water.\n[2004-05-31 10:30:00] bench outside office | I put on my coat, went out and crossed the street. I sat down on the bench across from the hospital and smoked three cigarettes in a row. I observed the passing people and vehicles. I saw the gloomy gray sky and felt the damp cold air. I noticed the snow along the roadside blackened by exhaust fumes.\n[2004-05-31 10:45:00] bench outside office | I pulled out my phone, tapped around, wrote a short poem, and sent it to Karl Larsdal. I heard the lines I had written: 'Karl Larsdal Karl Larsdal, you're dead and gone... She has love, don’t miss the dawn.'\n[2004-05-31 11:00:00] office | I walked back inside and sat down at the computer again. I noticed my phone vibrating in my pocket. I heard myself mentally rehearsing: I’ll talk about *Out of This World* and *Everything in Its Time*, and I’ll have to look happy and proud while doing it. I felt a deep disgust, thinking there were still five days before completion, and starting to write felt harder. I realized I had to finish this speech, yet inwardly I believed it was all nonsense.\n[2004-05-31 11:05:00] office | I took out my phone and opened Karl Larsdal’s message. I read his text: 'You were right: died this morning in a traffic accident. My porn magazines are yours… Can you write something better?'\n[2004-05-31 11:10:00] office | I replied to Karl with a text message. I read my own reply: \"Of course I can—take a look at this. Karl Larsdal, young soul lost, lies beneath the sod. He drove a Saab, wheels flew free... only then did youth and death agree!\"\n[2004-05-31 12:00:00] supermarket / office | After sending the message, I went to the supermarket to buy some food. After eating, I fell asleep on the sofa for an hour. This kind of text exchange isn't particularly fun, but at least it passes the time. I can even imagine these verses earning Karl Larsdal a few cheap laughs in his university office.\n[2004-05-31 18:00:00] office | I finished reading the first volume of The Brothers Karamazov and immediately started on the second. I noticed that it had grown completely dark outside when I finished the book. I felt the house fill with the various sounds of early evening. I was overcome by a feeling I used to have as a teenager—I remembered how I often lay in bed for hours on end, absorbed in books. My head felt a bit chilly; I realized I might have caught a cold while sleeping. The world around me, bathed in the afterglow of sunset, seemed hard and hostile.\n[2004-05-31 18:15:00] office | I washed my hands with hot water and dried them carefully. I shut down the computer, packed it into my bag, wrapped my scarf around my neck, pulled my hat over my head, put on my coat and shoes. I walked out, locked the door behind me, put on my gloves, and stepped onto the street. I thought I still had just over half an hour before meeting Karl Larsdal at Pelican Restaurant—it was early enough.\n[2004-05-31 18:30:00] Harvik Street | I walked up Sheriff Street toward the subway station where it intersects with Mochengdao Road. I saw the snow on the sidewalk had turned a yellowish brown, covered with a fine layer of granular particles like coarse flour. I realized walking on this kind of snow meant slipping was likely. I noticed it was now half past six.\n[2004-05-31 18:32:00] Harvik Street | I walked briskly along the street. I saw the streets around me were nearly empty, filled with shapeless darkness. I noticed only the faint glow of electric lights reflected through every window and streetlamp, spreading across the snow, pavement, stairs, railings, cars, and building facades. As I walked, I thought it wouldn’t matter at all if I became someone else. I realized I didn’t feel any qualities uniquely my own at this moment.\n[2004-05-31 18:35:00] Queen Street / subway station | I passed Queen Street, descended the steps beside Observatory Park, and finally went down the stairwell leading underground to the subway. At the lower end of the street, I saw a swarm of dark, beetle-like figures crowded together. I noticed a repulsive sign hanging outside one of the Chinese restaurants urging people to 'drink heavily.'\n[2004-05-31 18:40:00] subway platform | I stood where the platform was least crowded, placed my bag between my feet, and leaned against the wall with one shoulder. I took out my phone and dialed Henrik Inge. I saw there were about thirty or forty people on both platforms. Judging by the bags people carried, I guessed most of them were on their way home from work.\n[2004-05-31 18:40:10] subway platform | I heard Henrik say, \"Hello?\" I said, \"Hi, it's Grete Lundnes.\" I heard him reply, \"I know.\"\n[2004-05-31 18:40:30] subway platform | I asked him, \"Did you call me?\" I heard him confirm he had called on Saturday. I explained I'd meant to call back, but got busy because someone came over for dinner, so I forgot. I heard Henrik Inge say, \"No problem. It wasn't anything urgent.\"\n[2004-05-31 18:41:00] subway platform | I asked him, \"Did the kitchenware arrive?\" I heard him reply that it had just arrived today, right beside him. He then told me he'd bought a new car, and I blurted out in surprise, \"No way!\" I heard him explain it was a Citroën XM, not too old, but originally a hearse.\n[2004-05-31 18:41:30] subway platform | I exclaimed, \"You're kidding!\" I heard him say he wasn't kidding. I asked in disbelief if he really intended to drive a hearse around everywhere. I heard him explain that of course the car had been modified—there was no space for coffins anymore and it looked perfectly normal. I remarked to him that sounded easy enough, but still, dead bodies had definitely been carried inside it; I said I hadn't heard anything so creepy in a long time.\n[2004-05-31 18:42:00] subway platform | I heard Henrik Inge snort and say to me, \"You're too sensitive. It's a perfectly normal car. And I can afford it.\" I replied, \"Yeah, yeah.\"\n[2004-05-31 18:42:30] subway platform | After a brief silence, I asked, \"Anything else new?\" I heard him say there was nothing particularly worth mentioning, and then he asked how I was doing. I told him, \"No, nothing much. I was at Nils Nils’s mother’s place yesterday.\" I heard him respond, \"Oh, really.\" I answered, \"Yes.\"\n[2004-05-31 18:43:00] subway platform | I heard him ask, \"How’s Vanya doing? She’s started walking, right?\" I told him, \"She can take a few steps. But honestly, she falls more than she walks.\" I heard him chuckle on the other end of the phone.\n[2004-05-31 18:43:30] subway platform | I asked him, \"Are Torgeir and Ylva doing all right?\" I heard him answer that they were fine. He then mentioned that Torgeir had written me a letter at school and asked if I’d received it. I told him I hadn’t. I heard him say Torgeir didn’t want him to know what was in it, but I’d understand once I read it. I responded, \"Okay.\"\n[2004-05-31 18:44:00] subway platform | I noticed the crowd beginning to move forward. I said to him, \"The train’s coming. Talk later.\" I saw the headlights of the train lighting up deep within the tunnel, and felt a light breeze sweep across the platform.\n[2004-05-31 18:44:10] subway platform | I watched the train slow down before me. I picked up my backpack and stepped forward a few paces toward the doors. I heard Henrik say, \"Okay, talk later. Bye.\" I said back, \"Bye.\"\n[2004-05-31 18:44:20] subway platform | I saw the doors open and passengers stream out. Just as I lowered my hand holding the phone, I felt someone bump into my elbow from behind. I watched my phone fly out of my hand and into the crowd beside the doorway. I didn’t see where it fell because I instinctively turned my head to look at the person who bumped me.\n[2004-05-31 18:44:30] subway platform | I crouched down searching the platform in front of me, then stood up and stretched my neck, scanning the people heading toward the exit. I saw a woman walking ahead with an open bag hanging from her arm. I anxiously searched for the phone in my mind, wondering why I hadn’t heard it hit the ground. I suspected maybe it had hit someone’s foot or been kicked away. I even wondered if it might have fallen into that woman’s bag, though reason told me that was unlikely—I couldn’t help but let my imagination run wild.\n[2004-05-31 18:44:50] subway platform | I quickened my pace, following closely behind that woman. I struggled internally over whether I should gently tap her on the shoulder and ask to check what was in her bag. I wanted to tell her my phone was missing and that I thought it might be inside her bag. But in the end, I realized I couldn't do it.",

    "text": "[2004-05-31 18:45:00] subway car | I jumped in just before the train doors closed, then sat down beside a passenger in their twenties dressed in goth style. The warning alarm for closing doors sounded in my ears. I saw the station lights flash past through the carriage windows, then everything outside turned pitch black. I thought about how the next train wouldn’t come for another ten minutes, and I was already late—besides, my phone was an old model. I felt dizzy and disoriented.\n[2004-05-31 19:00:00] Pelikan Pub | Fifteen minutes later, I got off at Skanstull, withdrew cash from an ATM outside the station, crossed the street, and entered Pelikan Pub. I saw it was a classic pub, with a black-and-white checkerboard floor crowded with benches and tables. I noticed brown wooden wainscoting on the walls and decorative paintings on the ceiling. There were several wide pillars covered in paneling, each enclosing a long, broad bar counter inside.\n[2004-05-31 19:01:00] Pelikan Pub | I pushed open the door and stepped into the noisy pub. I noticed the servers were mostly elderly, dressed in black clothes and white aprons. Though there was no music, I heard a roaring din of voices—the laughter and clinking of glasses forming a thick cloud above the tables. I found this noise striking when first stepping in from the street, almost intrusive and overwhelming.\n[2004-05-31 19:02:00] Pelikan Pub | I noticed a few scattered drunkards and the gradually vanishing breed of solitary old men dining alone. The majority of customers were middle-class men and women from cultural circles—journalists, editors, graduate students, or writers. From my observation, those drunkards seemed convinced they’d been drinking here since the 1960s. I knew, as in other parts of Södermalm, the number of lonely old men coming here to eat was dwindling.\n[2004-05-31 19:03:00] Pelikan Pub | I stopped near the entrance, unwrapping my scarf and coat while scanning the crowd. I didn’t see Karl Larsdal. I saw eyeglasses glinting, white teeth and bald heads catching the light. I noticed everyone had beer in front of them, the yellowish glow of the drinks reflected against the dark brown tabletops.\n[2004-05-31 19:04:00] Pelikan Pub | I walked over to a table with a tablecloth and sat down with my back to the wall. A waitress, around sixty years old, approached and handed me a thick menu with a faux-leather cover. I said to the waitress, 'There are two of us, so we’ll order later.'\n[2004-05-31 19:04:30] Pelikan Pub | I asked the waitress, 'Could I have a Staropramen beer first?' I heard her reply, 'Of course.' She asked if I wanted it 'white or black.' I answered, 'White, thank you.' I saw that the waitress had a fleshy, broad face and thick, luxuriant reddish-brown hair.\n[2004-05-31 19:05:00] Pelikan Pub | I knew that people in the 1930s used to sit here drinking and chatting exactly like this. I understood one of Halviken’s strengths was how many of its establishments had survived across generations. I thought there was still over half an hour before the meeting—plenty of time. This distinctive pub atmosphere drew my thoughts toward more classical eras. I marveled that the ambiance didn’t feel like a deliberate museum exhibit, but rather a genuinely preserved way of life.\n[2004-05-31 19:05:30] Pelikan Pub | I recalled that the Van der Noot Palace, built in the seventeenth century, was where Bjorn Berldal supposedly got drunk for the first time. I remembered having lunch there occasionally, and the strange, solemn mood in the city the day after Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was assassinated.\n[2004-05-31 19:06:00] Pelican Brewery | As far as I know, the old town has the eighteenth-century Golden Peace Restaurant and the nineteenth-century Pewter Restaurant. I also learned about Burns Salon and the 1920s-style Gondolen Bar. I realized that one could overlook the entire city from the top floor of a bar. I imagined being in such a position, as if boarding a Zeppelin airship or standing in the lounge of some Atlantic liner.\n[2004-05-31 19:07:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw the waitress approaching with a tray full of glasses in one hand. I watched her cast a beer coaster down before me and set the glass upon it. I noticed she smiled at me briefly before moving on toward the noisier tables. I heard that at those many tables over there, someone probably made a witty remark every second.\n[2004-05-31 19:07:30] Pelican Brewery | I brought the glass to my lips, aware of how suddenly the taste startled me, making me shiver involuntarily before letting the liquid slide down my throat. I felt foam touch my lips, and the cold, slightly bitter liquid filled my mouth. I inwardly exclaimed: Oh.\n[2004-05-31 19:08:00] Pelican Brewery | In my imagination, shafts of sunlight poured through the windows onto wooden tables. I looked ahead, thinking that in a century defined by urban life and human-machine symbiosis, people might no longer consider the simplest things. I reflected on golden, fragrant, strong beer brewed from field grains and pasture hops; I also thought of bread or beetroot carrying that hidden earthy flavor, and our enduring diet.\n[2004-05-31 19:09:00] Pelican Brewery | I asked myself inwardly, what were people actually doing in seventeenth-century palaces? I pictured them wearing uniforms, high-heeled shoes, and powdered wigs. I realized that even if their minds were filled with seventeenth-century thoughts, without eating, drinking, defecating, and urinating, they could do nothing at all. I pondered that no matter how ideas about humanity and nature changed across centuries, apparently no one ever thought to change beer.\n[2004-05-31 19:10:00] Pelican Brewery | I knew that compared to the first human who saw daylight in Africa forty thousand years ago, our bodily needs had not essentially changed. I thought of malt, hops, and water—things originating from fields, pastures, and streams—that keep us tethered to the ancient past. I realized that although we imagine ourselves modern, and have organized ourselves accordingly, our behavior of getting drunk and dancing in bars may be far more misguided than performers around firelight twenty-five thousand years ago.\n[2004-05-31 19:11:00] Pelican Brewery | I wondered, how did this idea that we are modern even arise? I thought that even when people fell dead around others from incurable diseases, who could be called modern because of a brain tumor? I realized that if we know everyone will eventually rot in the ground, we cannot truly believe we are modern.\n[2004-05-31 19:12:00] Pelican Brewery | I brought the glass to my lips again and gulped down a large mouthful. I thought how much I loved drinking. I realized that within less than half a glass, my mind would already begin entertaining the idea of getting thoroughly drunk today. I considered just sitting here drinking one glass after another, but then questioned whether I should, and finally decided I shouldn't.\n[2004-05-31 19:13:00] Pelican Brewery | I noticed that during the few minutes I'd been here, a steady stream of people had entered the door. I saw that most people, upon entering, clumsily took off their coats while scanning the other guests inside.\n[2004-05-31 19:14:00] Pelican Brewery | Behind this new group, I recognized a face—I saw it was Thomas. I waved to him and watched him walk toward me. I realized with delight—it's him!\n[2004-05-31 19:14:10] Pelican Pub | I saw Thomas and I shook hands with him, then I sat down again. I said to him, \"Hi, Thomas.\" I heard him reply, \"Hi, Grete Lundnes,\" and exclaim how long it had been.\n[2004-05-31 19:14:30] Pelican Pub | I said to him, \"Yes, it's been a while. How have you been?\" I heard him say he was doing fine, and he asked me how I was. I told him I was doing well too.\n[2004-05-31 19:15:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Thomas say to me, \"I'm here to meet some people. They're sitting in the corner over there. Why don't you come join us?\" I thanked him and told him I was waiting for Karl Larsdal.\n[2004-05-31 19:15:30] Pelican Pub | I heard Thomas suddenly remember and say, \"Oh right! Yes, I think he mentioned he was meeting you. I spoke with him yesterday. If it's okay, I'll come by later to say hello.\" I replied, \"Of course,\" and said see you later.\n[2004-05-31 19:16:00] Pelican Pub | As far as I know, Thomas is a friend of Karl Larsdal’s, a photographer who has published three books. I learned that his first book was about the coast guard, the second about boxers, and his latest one about animals, still lifes, and landscapes. I looked at Thomas and thought he resembled Lenin strikingly—right down to the beard, bald head, and the T-shaped Mongolian eyes. I noticed that in his most recent work, it was the objects themselves and the surrounding emptiness that stood out most prominently.\n[2004-05-31 19:17:00] Pelican Pub | I reflected that in personal interactions, Thomas came across as kind and undemanding, someone before whom you never felt you might lose anything. I realized he cared about others and left an excellent impression on me. But in his work, I sensed he was extremely rigorous—his photographs leaned toward stylization, revealing a 'frozen chance.' Some of his images reminded me of ancient Greek sculptures, conveying an aura of gloom and violence.\n[2004-05-31 19:18:00] Pelican Pub | I recalled buying two of Thomas’s photographs as gifts during winter. I saw those two photographs now hanging in my study, beautifully framed. I knew they were meant as a fortieth birthday gift for Henrik Inge. I learned that Henrik clearly didn’t like them when he received them, so I eventually let him choose different ones and kept the two myself. I thought that even though I still felt a bit uneasy, I could understand why Henrik didn’t want to hang them in the living room. I realized the photographs conveyed death—they indeed seemed somewhat ominous.\n[2004-05-31 19:19:00] Thomas's Studio | I recalled knocking on the studio door. I watched Thomas’s colleague open it, and I followed his suggestion to wait there. I heard the messy-haired man say Thomas wasn’t in, but if I wanted, I could wait downstairs. I learned his name was Sofie Ingrid. Before me was a basement in the old town; I noticed the thick sixteenth-century stone walls around. I knew that Sofie Ingrid was a photographer sharing the studio with Thomas. I knew his most famous work was the photo on Tom Waits’ album, and he first gained fame with 'Café Lemitz.' I felt his photographic style was raw, intimate, and close to real life.\n[2004-05-31 19:20:00] Thomas's Studio | I watched him sit down on the sofa in the upstairs room of the studio and continue working. I also watched myself stand in front of a blackboard covered with photos for a while. I heard him ask if I wanted coffee; I replied I didn’t. I heard him humming softly as he flipped through contact sheets. I felt his presence was very strong when we were alone in the room. Observing him, I sensed a certain innocence in him. I thought that although he gave the impression of being widely experienced and worldly-wise, he acted as if nothing could ever truly move him.\n[2004-05-31 19:21:00] Thomas's Studio | I saw Thomas return after a few minutes. I watched him bring coffee, and we both sat down on the sofa by the stairs. I saw him examine the photographs and place them into plastic sleeves, and I saw myself pass the envelope with money across the table to him. Finally, I put the photographs into my backpack. I told him I had left the money for the photos there. I heard him thank me. I saw that Thomas seemed quite pleased to see me. I thought about how I always feel a certain awkwardness during private cash transactions.",

    "text": "[2004-05-31 19:22:00] Thomas's studio | I knew we had other connections besides Karl. As far as I knew, the woman living with Thomas, Mary, was a poet who had once taught Nils Nils. I learned that Mary had also translated plays by Svenlund and poems by Elizabeth Anders.\n[2004-05-31 19:23:00] Thomas's studio | I recalled the times I had met her. I knew I had only seen her two or three times. I felt she was a multifaceted person, rich in temperament. I thought that although she didn't appear obviously neurotic, when I saw her left pupil drop slightly between the iris and the white of her eye, I truly felt a shiver run through me—this impression completely dominated my view of her.\n[2004-05-31 19:24:00] Thomas's studio | I watched myself get up, grab my backpack, and shake hands with Thomas. I noticed myself going upstairs and out the door, walking onto the streets of the old town. I heard Thomas say they would invite me and Nils Nils to dinner one evening. I replied that sounded great. I told him I'd left the money for the photos there, and heard him thank me. I felt a bit ashamed inside.\n[2004-05-31 19:25:00] Pelikan Pub | I thought it had already been two months since Thomas mentioned inviting us to dinner. I realized I hadn’t received an invitation yet, but I didn’t really mind. Since I’d heard Thomas was forgetful—and so was I—I had no reason to hold it against him.\n[2004-05-31 19:26:00] Pelikan Pub | I watched Thomas sit down at the table farthest inside the pub. I took out the yellow Tiedemann tobacco pouch from my bag, rolled a cigarette with my fingertips, and lit it. I also lifted my beer and took a large gulp. Through the window, I caught sight of Karl Larsdal’s figure passing quickly by on the street. I felt my fingers grow slightly damp from sweat, causing the tobacco to stick to them. I thought Thomas sitting there looked exactly like a man wearing a Lenin mask.\n[2004-05-31 19:30:00] Pelikan Pub | I saw Karl Larsdal spot me as soon as he entered. I observed him walking toward my table while still scanning the interior of the pub. I thought he was like an old fox, always looking for alternatives. I realized he probably wouldn’t choose a place with few exits.\n[2004-05-31 19:30:10] Pelikan Pub | I saw Karl Larsdal shoot me a quick glance. I stood up, shook his hand, then sat down again. I heard him reach out and ask me, 'Why the hell aren't you answering your phone?'\n[2004-05-31 19:30:20] Pelikan Pub | I said to him, 'We agreed on seven—now it's half past.'\n[2004-05-31 19:30:30] Pelikan Pub | I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, 'You think I called just to tell you to watch out for the gap between the train and the platform?' I told him I'd lost my phone at the subway station.\n[2004-05-31 19:30:40] Pelikan Pub | I heard him challenge me, 'Lost it?' I explained that someone bumped my arm and the phone flew out—I guessed it landed in an open bag of a woman passing by.\n[2004-05-31 19:31:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, 'You really are something.' He then asked me if I had asked the person for their phone number. I replied that I hadn't, because the train was arriving, and besides, I wasn't even sure whether it had actually fallen in—I didn't feel I could just go checking someone's bag right there.\n[2004-05-31 19:31:30] Pelican Brewery | I saw him grab the menu and start looking around for a waiter. I shook my head at him. I heard him ask me, 'Did you order?'\n[2004-05-31 19:31:40] Pelican Brewery | I told him, 'She's over by the pillar.' I heard him ask what I wanted to eat, and I asked him to suggest something. He proposed, 'How about pork with onion sauce?' I replied, 'Yeah, that's an option.'\n[2004-05-31 19:35:00] Pelican Brewery | I thought about how every time I met Karl Larsdal, I felt a certain distance, as if he couldn't grasp that I was actually present. I realized he always gave off an air of arrogance, trying to keep me at arm's length, which made me somewhat angry. I remembered that whenever I fell silent in anger, he could always defuse the awkwardness with some teasing remark.\n[2004-05-31 19:40:00] Pelican Brewery | I realized this was a kind of psychological sparring Karl rehearsed in his mind. I thought that soon enough, he would drop his guard, becoming focused and engaged. I noticed his voice and gaze would change accordingly, and his laughter would shift from detached to genuine. I found that on the phone, we had always been equals from the start.\n[2004-05-31 19:45:00] Pelican Brewery | I knew he understood me better than anyone else—perhaps I understood him just as well. From my observation, although the differences between us had diminished, they had never completely disappeared. I reflected on those deeply rooted elements in our characters—things at the core that could never be destroyed—and realized these traits sometimes revealed themselves fully.\n[2004-05-31 19:46:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw those gifts—one Marine Corps combat knife still lying in its box, tucked behind a stack of books on my bookshelf. The other, a reproduction of an eighteenth-century edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, struck me as far more interesting. I remembered that after I finished writing 'Everything in Its Time,' he gave me a steel knife useful only for killing; later, when the book was published, he gave me a set of reproduced encyclopedias. I realized the knife was too frightening—it didn't suit me at all. I thought the encyclopedia, with its undiscovered objects and phenomena, seemed infinitely more fascinating instead.\n[2004-05-31 19:50:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw him take out a plastic envelope containing several sheets of paper and hand it to me. I nodded at him. I pulled the papers from the folder, stubbed out my cigarette, and began reading. I heard him say, 'Only three pages—can you take a look and tell me if it's any good?'\n[2004-05-31 19:52:00] Pelican Brewery | I knew this essay was based on Hanssen's concept of 'boundary states.' As far as I knew, its central idea explored the most intense conditions of existence—those approaching death—that touch upon the meaning of life. I realized this was exactly the opening section I had been searching for while reading his manuscript.\n[2004-05-31 19:53:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw him put the papers back into the plastic sleeve and tuck it into his bag. After finishing, I said admiringly, 'It's good.' I heard him press, 'Really?' I answered firmly, 'Of course.' I heard him say, 'You'll read more of it later,' and I responded, 'I believe you.'\n[2004-05-31 19:54:00] Pelican Pub | I saw him pull his chair forward and rest both elbows on the table. I noticed myself lighting another cigarette. I heard him say to me, 'By the way, your journalist called me today.' I asked which one, and he replied it was that fellow from the Evening Post.\n[2004-05-31 19:55:00] Pelican Pub | I asked Carl, 'So what did you say?' I knew the reporter wanted to write a profile piece, so I had given him both Lenavik's and Carl's numbers. I realized Carl was fully aware of my current situation.\n[2004-05-31 19:56:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Carl reply, 'Nothing at all.' Puzzled, I asked why. His voice came again in my ear: 'What should I have said? If I told him the truth, he'd either not understand or completely misinterpret it. So it's better to say as little as possible.' I challenged him on what good that would do.\n[2004-05-31 19:57:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Carl say, 'How would I know? You're the one who gave him my number...' I told him I'd given it to him so he could say something, adding that it didn't matter how they wrote it.\n[2004-05-31 19:58:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Carl stare at me and say, 'You wouldn't have done that. But yes, I did tell him one thing about you. Actually, maybe the most important thing.' I pressed him: 'What was it?'\n[2004-05-31 19:59:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Carl say, 'You have a strong moral sense. Do you know what that fool answered? “Everyone has that.” That’s precisely what they don’t have.' I argued it just meant the reporter understood things differently from him. Then I heard Carl say the reporter was only looking for some sensational story about me getting drunk.\n[2004-05-31 20:00:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Carl say, 'We’ll find out tomorrow. It can’t be that bad. After all, it’s the Evening Post.' I nodded along, saying, 'Yes, yes.'\n[2004-05-31 20:01:00] Pelican Pub | I saw Carl sitting across from me, shaking his head as he looked for the waiter. I noticed the waitress approaching and placing two plates in front of us. I raised my glass in a gesture. I heard Carl order pork with onion sauce and a glass of white beer. I ordered meatballs and said to the waitress, 'Thank you, could I have another one?' I heard the waitress readily agree. I saw the waitress tuck her small notebook into her pocket. I noticed the view into the kitchen through the swinging door.\n[2004-05-31 20:02:00] Pelican Pub | I asked, 'What exactly do you mean by having a strong moral sense?' I heard Carl explain that I was an extremely moral person, that this sense had become a physiological reflex in my character, and that I couldn't escape the overwhelming shame that flooded over me.\n[2004-05-31 20:03:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Carl go on, saying I wasn't a hypocrite or a moralizer, but a thoroughgoing Protestant. He believed Protestantism meant living inwardly in alignment with oneself. He asserted I couldn't lead a double life because, in me, life and morality were one and the same.\n[2004-05-31 20:04:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl say that most people are like Peer Gynt, taking crooked paths in life, while I act with utmost seriousness and integrity. He asked me, 'Is there a single manuscript you haven't read from the first page to the last?' I answered, 'No.'\n[2004-05-31 20:05:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl say this proved I could never get away with half-hearted work. He called me the 'happy auditor,' saying that even if I obtained what others dreamed of, I'd merely cross it off my ledger. He sighed, 'Nothing will ever make you happy.'\n[2004-05-31 20:06:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl burst out laughing at me. I heard Karl say that I faced far greater temptations than others, and if it were him, he’d long have been living a double life. He remarked, 'You're destined to live a simple life.'\n[2004-05-31 20:07:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl laugh and say I wasn't Peer Gynt. He believed the core of my nature was the pursuit of an innocent ideal. He mentioned Baudelaire’s Virginie, saying that kind of innocence is not knowing what you don’t know.\n[2004-05-31 20:08:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl mention Caravaggio’s painting, saying I was the one in the picture being deceived by those around me. He believed this innocence resided in my obsessive nostalgia for the past. He even described Nils Nils as a mixture of Madame Bovary and Kaspar Hauser. I nodded in agreement. As far as I know, Kaspar Hauser is a mystery. I recognize that both Nils Nils and Tonje possess an air of innocence. I recalled that this innocence is my own unique pursuit. I realized how clearly this desire for beauty and purity manifests within me.\n[2004-05-31 20:09:00] Pelican Brewery | I objected that my writing focused on the physiological aspects. I heard Karl say those angels were still epitomes of purity. He pointed out that I had turned angels into humans, making them fall into humanity. I heard him exclaim, 'Well done!'\n[2004-05-31 20:10:00] Pelican Brewery | I argued that innocence must become bodily. I told him that although all this happened deep in my subconscious, I hadn’t realized before that I had written a book about shame. I came to understand that only much later did I realize the connection between innocence and that thirteen-year-old girl. I realized these things had previously been hidden from me.\n[2004-05-31 20:11:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl say it was obvious in the book. I asked him whether he thought innocence was close to stupidity or ignorance. He countered, 'Ignorance?'\n[2004-05-31 20:12:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw the waitress bring over the beers. I gave him a small smile. I heard Karl say innocence is absolutely not stupidity. He believed we live in an era that worships experience, and that I demonstrate independence by declaring renunciation. I heard him say I was practically a 'saint.' I realized Karl sees my pure actions as profoundly challenging within this culture.\n[2004-05-31 20:12:10] Pelican Brewery | I raised my glass. I said 'Cheers' to Karl and heard him reply, 'Cheers.'\n[2004-05-31 20:12:30] Pelican Brewery | I took a large gulp of beer, wiped the foam from my lips with the back of my hand, and set the glass back on the coaster. I turned to look at Karl. I asked, “Like a saint?” I felt an invigorating sensation from the golden liquid coursing through me.\n[2004-05-31 20:13:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard myself say to Karl, “Don’t you think that’s a bit exaggerated?” His firm reply came: “No, not at all. What you’re doing is profoundly incomplete.” I pressed him: “In what way?”\n[2004-05-31 20:14:00] Pelican Brewery | I listened as Karl went on about life, opportunity, survival, and creation. He told me, “To me, you live an almost terrifyingly ascetic life. More precisely, you indulge in asceticism.” He remarked how unusual and abnormal such a life was—so much so that it reminded him of saints or priests. I said to him, “Don’t go on.”\n[2004-05-31 20:15:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl say, “It was you who asked. There’s no ready-made concept that fits you.” He asserted that my traits weren’t rooted in social morality but in religion—even without belief in God. He told me I was the only person he knew who, despite not believing in God, could take communion without profaning it.\n[2004-05-31 20:16:00] Pelican Brewery | I asked Karl, “Hasn’t anyone else you know ever done this?” I heard him reply that yes, some had—but not purely. He himself once took communion for money, later cutting ties with the church. He mentioned using the money to buy a knife. Then he asked what we’d been talking about. I answered, “Me.”\n[2004-05-31 20:17:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl laugh and say there was something in common between me and Beckett, quoting Jolán who claimed, “Compared to Beckett, I’m just a whore.” I heard him sigh, feeling my life seemed more wasted than others’ because I had too many things to squander. He lamented that I was like Midas—everything I touched turned to gold, yet I couldn’t derive joy from it. Finally, he asked me, “Do you think your journalist friend can write about these things?”\n[2004-05-31 20:18:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl reply, “No.” He believed the journalist would be constrained by his own system, utterly unable to approach my essence. I heard him speak of tragedy as good people caught in bad times. He sighed, saying that for him, my choosing to let go while standing in Midas’s position was a tragedy unfolding right before his eyes.\n[2004-05-31 20:19:00] Pelican Brewery | I said to Karl Larsdal, “Everyone’s like that.” I heard him retort that maybe so, maybe not, and brought up my distorted self-image and desires. I said to him, “Are you finished?” Then I told him the portrait he painted of me could only come from him—because someone like Henrik, my mother, or any relatives or friends wouldn’t understand what we were talking about.\n[2004-05-31 20:20:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl ask, “Wouldn’t this feel unreal?” He recalled Nils Nils once saying I wanted my life to be extraordinary. I listened as he launched into a long argument—that the greatness of celebrities is externally constructed, a kind of “prescribed situation,” whereas our face-to-face encounter here and now was far more real. Finally, he said to me, “I’m the underground man; you’re Icarus.”",

He told me that the “greatness” of famous people comes from others’ applause, while our meeting here and now was true reality. In the end, I heard him say, “I’m the underground man; you’re Icarus.”\n[2004-05-31 20:22:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw the waitress approaching us with dishes, placing two meals in front of Karl and me. I watched her set down the plate of pork piled into an island-like mound, and the meatballs smothered in thick cream sauce on my own plate. I noticed Karl spreading his napkin over his lap and shaking his head at me. I looked up at the waitress and said, \"Thank you.\" Then I asked, \"Can I have another one?\" I heard her reply, \"A Staro, right.\" I heard her ask Karl, who responded, \"Not yet, thanks.\" Before me were bright green mashed peas and red lingonberry sauce. I smelled the rich aroma of cream sauce and cooked meat.\n[2004-05-31 20:23:00] Pelican Brewery | I drained the last sip from my glass. I saw myself putting three potatoes onto my plate. I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, \"That's not a compliment, don't get it wrong.\" I asked, \"What?\"\n[2004-05-31 20:24:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl talking about the 'saintly image,' telling me that modern people don’t want to live holy lives of suffering and sacrifice—everyone only cares whether introspection leads to success. I heard his mockery, saying that modern prayer is essentially just an expression of desire; no one prays unless they want something.\n[2004-05-31 20:25:00] Pelican Brewery | I retorted, \"I want plenty of things.\" I heard Karl reply that even so, those things wouldn't bring me happiness. He told me that refusing to pursue a happy life is the most provocative act, and what he values most is 'living.'\n[2004-05-31 20:26:00] Pelican Brewery | I picked up the bowl of potatoes and placed it steadily in front of him. I said to Karl, \"Talking to you is like going to the devil for treatment.\" I heard him respond that the devil always loses in the end. I countered, \"That remains to be seen—it’s not over yet.\" I heard him sigh, admitting I was right, but he couldn't see any sign that the devil was winning.\n[2004-05-31 20:27:00] Pelican Brewery | I pressed on, \"Even if God is no longer among us?\" I heard Karl comment that 'among us' was a good way to put it, because God has moved from being high above to being internalized, contained within us.\n[2004-05-31 20:30:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw the two of us eating in silence for several minutes. I heard Karl Larsdal ask, \"By the way, how was your day?\" I replied, \"It can't even be called a day.\" I explained to him that I had intended to write a speech, but found it all nonsensical, so I switched to reading instead.\n[2004-05-31 20:31:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw Karl Larsdal place his beer glass down on the table. I heard Karl tease that he'd thought I’d been having an even worse day. I admitted maybe so, but lamented how maddening I find this sort of thing, and believed he’d never understand. I heard him ask, \"What sort of thing?\"\n[2004-05-31 20:32:00] Pelican Brewery | I told Karl about my aversion to being forced to praise my own work in a speech, saying, \"It's unpleasant because I'll have to stand there and talk about my book with approving words.\" I heard my own indignation, feeling that being praised is a miserable fate, and that such social rituals make me feel trapped and embarrassed.\n[2004-05-31 20:33:00] Pelican Brewery | I continued telling him that only praise from people close to me means anything; I feel completely powerless about the opinions of outsiders. I heard my own frustration, realizing that just talking about this already makes me incredibly agitated.\n[2004-05-31 20:34:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw Karl Larsdal staring at me, his knife and fork hovering above his plate. I heard Karl say that he had noted down two things I once said—one was about Harry Martinson committing suicide after winning the Nobel Prize, and that I had expressed deep understanding of that motive.\n[2004-05-31 20:35:00] Pelican Brewery | I explained to Karl that Martinson’s election as an academician of Mochengdao College had been systematically questioned, and without a strong enough mindset to endure ridicule, it would be unbearable. I asked, 'What's the second thing?'\n[2004-05-31 20:36:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl tease me, saying there was no safer place to keep a secret than with me—'you forget everything.' He told me my mind was like Swiss cheese without the cheese. He mentioned I once brought up Jastrow from *The Great Destruction*.\n[2004-05-31 20:37:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl repeat my opinion that *The Great Destruction* was the most terrifying book I’d ever read. He recalled my belief that the 'fall' in the book wasn’t really a fall, but rather letting go and drifting far away, like a boat untethering from a dock.\n[2004-05-31 20:38:00] Pelican Brewery | I sighed to him, finally remembering how perfectly the author had captured the sensation of drunkenness. I heard my own voice express realization—that falling could also have a lazy, non-resistant side, and this casual feeling shocked me because it truly felt beautiful.\n[2004-05-31 20:39:00] Pelican Brewery | Laughing loudly, I said to Karl, 'You can never let go, can you?' I heard him answer firmly, 'No,' then ask me the same. I replied, 'Yes.'\n[2004-05-31 20:40:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl laughingly talk about people he knew who 'let go.' He told me Stefan drank heavily every day on the farm, Helen Ster·Marivikdal even drank whiskey from a milk glass. I heard him mention Tony’s drug addiction.\n[2004-05-31 20:41:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw the woman at the neighboring table stand up and walk toward the restroom door. I quickly lowered my head, staring intently at the tabletop. I knew Ilda had worked at Hypnotic Press, also held jobs at bookstores, and recently co-founded a company. I knew she was unpredictable by nature and deeply passionate about life. I realized it was Ilda. I didn’t want to speak with her now. I remembered she had once been Nils Nils’s close friend, and we had spent considerable time together.\n[2004-05-31 20:42:00] Pelican Brewery | I knew Nils Nils had met her in a very casual way. I knew Ilda had the full-figured charm of a 1950s woman and had attracted many writers’ affections. As far as I knew, she often displayed an impolite, sulky teenage demeanor that even frightened Kora.\n[2004-05-31 20:43:00] Pelican Brewery | I knew Ilda’s partner was Magnus Nord, who was pursuing a PhD. I recalled that at our last meeting during a party at his place, he mentioned having met Yodar—my friend Preben—at an academic seminar.\n[2004-05-31 20:44:00] Pelican Pub | I saw Magnus Nord fall silent from embarrassment and suddenly felt a strong urge to refill my glass. I learned that Preben had harshly criticized my new book in several newspapers. I knew he belonged to the circle of friends associated with Baysang in my memory. I sensed a small wave of embarrassment surrounding him. I guessed Preben might not have said anything good about me—perhaps even spoken of fierce criticism toward my new book. I realized such criticism pierced me like a knife in the back.\n[2004-05-31 20:45:00] Pelican Pub | As far as I knew, Ilda’s company organized events between publishers and bookstores, ran literary festivals, or put on shows. I realized the reason I didn’t want to talk to Ilda wasn’t entirely due to the criticisms Magnus mentioned. I thought perhaps I simply had no interest in hearing about her business—I just didn’t care.\n[2004-05-31 20:46:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, 'That evening at your place last time was really nice.' I replied that it had been five weeks ago. I heard him mention that he’d talked with Kristina yesterday and they wanted to invite our whole family over soon. I casually answered, 'Sure.' I realized this was indeed our last meeting. I thought it felt strange that he brought it up so suddenly now.\n[2004-05-31 20:47:00] Pelican Pub | I said to Karl, 'By the way, Thomas is here—did you see him? He's sitting further in.'\n[2004-05-31 20:49:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Karl laugh loudly, saying Thomas had initially loved that article about angels but probably forgot it was mine because of forgetfulness. I sighed to Karl that although I was only thirty-five, I often felt the same. I told him about the last time I drank here with Jorgensen—though I listened intently and found the content gripping, by the next day I’d forgotten all the sensitive details, retaining only the general framework. I thought how truly tormenting this kind of forgetfulness was—even when fully focused, nothing seemed to leave a lasting trace.\n[2004-05-31 20:50:00] Pelican Pub | I saw myself nodding and smiling in front of Karl, trying to feign understanding. I told Karl about how Tonje once shared a terrible secret from her life with me, and though I listened extremely carefully, I completely forgot it months later. I lamented to him that this put me in a difficult position—because if I admitted the truth, she would leave me. I told him this kind of forgetfulness was everywhere: when dealing with Frederik’s emails or listening to writers talk about their new books, I often felt utterly lost and had to pretend to keep up. I realized this kind of forgetting was nothing short of a social disaster. I thought that if I didn’t pretend to know, I’d cause serious offense.\n[2004-05-31 20:51:00] Pelican Pub | I knew Sandlund came from a farm near Jorgensen’s hometown. I realized how dangerous such 'certainty' could be. I recalled Sandlund’s shocked expression upon hearing the news, while I had confidently spread this false information as if it were true.\n[2004-05-31 20:52:00] Pelican Pub | I wondered to myself what made me believe his father had died? I realized it was pure imagination, yet I had no clue how it started. I thought I’d feel terribly uneasy the next time I saw Jorgensen, afraid he’d find out I’d been spreading such nonsense.\n[2004-05-31 20:53:00] Pelican Pub | I heard Karl tease that my brain was like Swiss cheese. His laughter rang in my ears as he asked, 'When was the last time you spoke to your dad?'\n[2004-05-31 20:54:00] Pelican Pub | I said to Karl, 'It’s a disability. Like poor eyesight.' I went on to describe this inner, hidden void, and how people expend great effort hiding it. I remarked that the world is full of such inwardly disabled individuals, whose communication isn’t based on intellect, but merely on an intuitive reading of appearances. Before me lay the restaurant’s established patterns of behavior: conversation, speech, service. I sensed they seemed designed to conceal some absence. I realized this pursuit of 'normalcy' stemmed from our need—as inwardly disabled people—for a safe template where we could meet. Yet I thought that even within such templates, we never truly connect.",

    "text": "[2004-05-31 20:55:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl laughing in agreement. He mentioned Anna Jorgen's view that people go to extraordinary lengths just to appear 'normal' in front of others. His words reached my ears, arguing that even if we formally came together, the rift between us could never truly be bridged. Looking at Karl before me, I realized he fully understood the kind of loneliness I was trying to express.\n[2004-05-31 20:56:00] Pelican Brewery | I said to Karl, 'But didn't Anna Jorgen also say he could take a plane, parachute down anywhere on Earth, and know he'd be warmly received wherever he landed?'\n[2004-05-31 20:57:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Karl say, 'Yes, she did say that. I wrote it in my paper.' He remarked that even today’s Baghdad could prove this—every person carries some minimal degree of universal humanity. I replied, 'The world is small.' As far as I know, Karl had once been to Baghdad; it was indeed an extreme yet real example. I remembered having read that argument in his paper, realizing how closely our worlds intersected.\n[2004-05-31 20:58:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw Ilda approaching us from a distance. Her low-heeled shoes and summer floral dress came into view. I noticed her appearing behind Karl.\n[2004-05-31 20:58:10] Pelican Brewery | I heard Ilda greet me, 'Hi, Grete Lundnes, how are you?' I responded, 'Hi, Ilda, very well. How about you?' Her voice reached my ears again as she asked how things were at home, with Nils Nils and the little girl, and sighed about how quickly time flies.\n[2004-05-31 20:58:30] Pelican Brewery | I shrugged at Ilda. I told Ilda that Nils Nils was busy with schoolwork, so I took care of pushing the stroller and taking Vannia out during the day. I heard her ask how I was feeling, and I briefly replied, 'Fine.'\n[2004-05-31 20:59:00] Pelican Brewery | I heard Ilda say she was considering having children too, but the idea of babies and breast milk made her feel slightly nauseated. She asked me to give her regards to Nils Nils. I replied, 'Of course. Say hello to Magnus Nord!'\n[2004-05-31 21:00:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw her raise her hand in a wave before walking back to her seat. I turned to look at Karl. I said to Karl, 'She just finished her exam.' Then I told him about Ilda’s first time overtaking another car while driving—an incident that ended with her crashing into a guardrail and flipping the car, yet somehow escaping unharmed.\n[2004-05-31 21:01:00] Pelican Brewery | I saw Karl Larsdal nodding. I noticed the waitress come by to clear the table. I also saw myself lighting a cigarette, poking the ash in the ashtray with its tip. We ordered two more beers and sat there in silence. I heard Karl murmur, 'Those who survive great danger are destined for good fortune.' I felt the air around us grow quiet in that moment.\n[2004-06-01 14:00:00] Subway / Office | I took the subway to Uden Square, then walked to my office. I stayed alone in that space. I realized this act of mine was merely a way to find a place to be by myself. I thought that under my current mood, I simply couldn’t bear being in cafés filled with strangers and their watching eyes.\n[2004-06-01 16:10:00] office | I saw myself sitting behind the writing desk for a while. Later, I fell asleep on the sofa. When I woke up, I noticed that the street outside the window had turned completely dark. I thought about writing that speech, yet felt overwhelmed with despair. I realized it was already 4:10.\n[2004-06-01 16:30:00] office | I watched myself put on my coat and walk out of the office. I realized the journalist would arrive at six. I thought that if I still wanted to see Vanja and Nils Nils today, I had to go home right now.\n[2004-06-01 17:00:00] home | I opened the door and entered the apartment. I saw Vanja crawling toward me at full speed. I laughed, tossed her into the air, caught her, and finally carried her into the kitchen. I heard myself shouting, \"Is anyone home?\" Vanja's loud laughter rang in my ears.\n[2004-06-01 17:05:00] kitchen | I saw Nils Nils stirring something in a pot in the kitchen. I heard her tell me she was cooking chickpeas. I asked her how Vanja had been today.\n[2004-06-01 17:06:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils say Vanja had great fun at the museum. I heard her mention that my mother had just left and ask whether I'd run into her. I replied that I hadn't. I knew they had gone to the June Mountain Museum this morning.\n[2004-06-01 17:10:00] bedroom | I saw myself carrying Vanja into the bedroom and tossing her playfully around on the big bed. When I got tired, I put her back in her chair in the kitchen. I noticed Vanja’s face had turned red from excitement and laughter.\n[2004-06-01 17:15:00] living room | I walked into the living room and sat down at the computer. I looked down at the apartment across the street, one floor lower, and saw the glow of a computer screen. I recalled seeing a man masturbating in that window before. I remembered there had been other people in the room behind the wall at that time. I remembered that scene and marveled again at how astonishingly close private spaces can be to public ones.\n[2004-06-01 17:16:00] home | I saw that the room across the way was now empty. I stood up and started walking toward the kitchen. I heard Nils Nils call from the kitchen, \"Dinner's ready!\" The sight of a book lying open, face-up on the windowsill across the way caught my eye. I noticed it was already quarter past five.\n[2004-06-01 17:17:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils ask what time the journalist was coming. I replied it was six. I told her we’d be leaving soon, so she didn’t need to come out and greet them if she didn’t feel like it. I realized she must have noticed me glancing up at the clock.\n[2004-06-01 17:18:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils say she’d stay in the kitchen. Her comforting words reached my ears—telling me not to push myself, just to talk with them easily and naturally. I realized she was being considerate of how I was feeling right now.\n[2004-06-01 17:20:00] kitchen at home | I heard myself telling Nils Nils about a conversation I once had with Ciliaviksen, in which she mentioned that she never reads articles about herself or watches her own TV programs, focusing only on immediate insights. I told her I actually agree with those words deeply. I knew Ciliaviksen had accompanied me to many book clubs; to me, she was as warm and familiar as a mother. I realized that behind such rejection of attention still hides vanity. I asked myself inwardly: Am I seen by others as a complete fool or just an ordinary one? Does this reflect who I really am, or merely some image?\n[2004-06-01 17:22:00] kitchen at home | I heard Nils Nils say to me, 'I hope you can let all this go—it's really not worth it! You're always thinking about these things.' I replied that I understood, and I would try to stop and reject them. I realized she saw through me—how I was wasting too much energy on pointless self-reflection.\n[2004-06-01 17:24:00] kitchen at home | I heard Nils Nils say, 'You're an exceptionally, exceptionally good person. I wish you could just understand that.' I countered, 'The feeling inside me is exactly the opposite. Honestly, it's like that with everything.' She quickly added that she didn't mean I should see a psychologist. I inwardly lamented that this sense of inadequacy has run through nearly everything I've done.\n[2004-06-01 17:26:00] kitchen at home | I saw Nils Nils looking down at Vanja. I noticed Vanja smiling at us. I saw rice on the table and floor, observed red jam on her lips, and grains of rice clinging around her mouth. I heard myself tell Nils Nils that she probably felt the same way, only with a relatively more intact sense of pride. I heard Nils Nils look at Vanja with concern and whisper, 'I hope Vanja isn't affected.' I realized that parental feelings of inferiority inevitably affect children—it's something that cannot be hidden.\n[2004-06-01 17:28:00] kitchen at home | I comforted Nils Nils, saying the impact on Vanja might not be too obvious. I saw tears glistening in her eyes as she softly responded, 'I hope not.' Looking at the scene before me, I felt a pang of sorrow deep inside.\n[2004-06-01 17:35:00] kitchen at home | I stood up and began clearing the table. I turned to look at Vanja and saw her proudly raising both arms above her head. I told Nils Nils the meal was delicious and said I'd do the dishes, wanting to clean up before the guests arrived. I asked Vanja, 'How big is Vanja now?'\n[2004-06-01 17:40:00] bathroom at home | I picked up Vanja from her chair and carried her into the bathroom. I held her up to the mirror and saw her laugh loudly at her reflection. Then I tightly hugged her close to me. I said to Vanja, 'So big!' Then I told her, 'Okay, now I'll wash your face.' I saw myself washing her face and hands.\n[2004-06-01 17:50:00] bedroom / kitchen at home | I changed Vanja’s diaper in the bedroom and then placed her on the floor. I returned to the kitchen to clean the dining table. I noticed the dishwasher under the counter humming steadily. In the meantime, I opened the kitchen cabinet. I realized I was holding onto an almost impossible mindset, trying to check the status of the liquor bottles.\n[2004-06-01 17:51:00] kitchen at home | I clearly noticed the grappa was less than before—the liquid level had dropped below yesterday’s marked label line. I also noticed the cognac bottle had been moved from its original position. I realized someone had touched these bottles, and a sense of foreboding rose within me.\n[2004-06-01 17:52:00] kitchen at home | I recalled that apart from myself and Nils Nils, the only other person who had been in the house recently was Inge. I firmly refused to believe it was Nils Nils—who we had just had a deep conversation with last night. I realized there was no explanation but Inge, and this weighed heavily on me.\n[2004-06-01 17:55:00] kitchen at home | I heard Nils Nils moving around in the bedroom, so I immediately shut the cupboard door and walked over to the counter, picking up a cloth to wipe the surface. I realized it was almost six o'clock, and I had to conceal my inner panic.\n[2004-06-01 17:56:00] kitchen at home | I said to Nils Nils, \"Can I go downstairs for a smoke before they arrive?\" Nils Nils replied, \"No problem. Go ahead. Could you take the trash down too?\"",

    "text": "[2004-06-01 18:00:00] front door at home | Just then, the doorbell rang. I went over and opened the door. I introduced myself to the guests, shook hands with the photographer, and invited them inside. I heard the young man with a beard introduce himself as Elizabeth Bunes and greet me. I asked, \"Would you like some coffee?\" Before me stood a young man with a shoulder bag. I noticed behind him another man, slightly older and dark-skinned, carrying a large camera bag slung across his shoulder.\n[2004-06-01 18:01:00] at home | I heard the young man tell me he was pleased to meet me. When I suggested coffee, I heard him reply, \"Sure, thanks.\"\n[2004-06-01 18:05:00] living room at home | I went into the kitchen and picked up the thermos and three cups. When I returned to the living room, I saw them looking around my apartment. I heard the journalist exclaim, \"You have quite a lot of books!\" I joked in response that I hadn't read most of them, and couldn't remember those I had.\n[2004-06-01 18:06:00] living room at home | I observed that the journalist had a beard, a neat set of large teeth, and an amiable look in his eyes. From my observation, the journalist appeared to be only twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. His confident and polished demeanor led me to guess he came from a middle-class family in eastern Leivik. I realized he belonged to the type who'd never suffered major setbacks. I also noticed the photographer was from Mochengdao, which made him harder for me to read compared to the journalist.\n[2004-06-01 18:08:00] living room at home | I told the journalist, \"I’d originally decided to decline the interview, but the publisher said you were excellent.\" He responded, \"I hope so.\" I wanted to ease the atmosphere with this small compliment.\n[2004-06-01 18:10:00] living room at home | I heard the photographer ask me, \"Can I take a few shots here?\" He assured me he’d only photograph me, not the interior of the apartment. After a moment’s hesitation, I agreed. I saw the photographer watching me, seeking my approval.\n[2004-06-01 18:11:00] living room at home | I knew the journalist had initially wanted to interview me at home, but I’d originally agreed only to meet outside. Yet later on the phone, I’d oddly invited them over for a visit. I realized when I extended the invitation over the phone, I could hear how genuinely pleased he was.\n[2004-06-01 18:15:00] living room at home | I stood in front of the bookshelf, holding my coffee cup. I noticed the photographer moving around me, searching for angles. I heard myself complying with posing instructions. I inwardly thought, this whole scene is one goddamn mess.\n[2004-06-01 18:16:00] living room at home | I heard the photographer direct me, saying, 'Could you lift your hand just a little bit?' I asked back, 'Will it look too forced?' Finally, I heard him compromise: 'Alright then, that's fine.'\n[2004-06-01 18:20:00] living room at home | I saw Vanja crawl into the hallway and stand up at the doorway. I picked her up into my arms. Then I saw Nils Nils come over, take Vanja from me, and carry her back to the kitchen. I said to the child, 'Hi, Vanja! A room full of strange uncles, huh?' I mentioned to the guest that the child recognized me.\n[2004-06-01 18:21:00] living room at home | I realized that whenever I met someone’s gaze, my behavior instantly became stiff and awkward. I inwardly lamented that I didn’t actually want to be this way, yet there I stood—like a fool wearing a fake, wooden smile.\n[2004-06-01 18:25:00] living room at home | I saw the photographer continue snapping pictures of me, so I struck another new pose. I joked with the photographer, 'A photographer once told me taking photos of me was like photographing wood.' I realized I truly was as stiff as wood right now.\n[2004-06-01 18:26:00] living room at home | I saw the photographer pause briefly, move his face away from the camera, smile at me, then resume shooting. I heard him reply, 'Must’ve been an amateur photographer.' I asked him back, 'But you know what he meant?'\n[2004-06-01 18:30:00] living room at home | I suggested to the journalist, 'I think we should go to Pelikan—it’s a place I often go to.' I heard him respond, 'Then let’s go there.' I knew Pelikan Bar was relatively quiet, with no music, making it perfect for an interview.\n[2004-06-01 18:31:00] living room at home | I heard the photographer suggest, 'But let’s take a few shots outside first, then I’ll let you two go.'\n[2004-06-01 18:32:00] living room at home | I noticed the journalist’s phone rang. I watched him answer and talk for about two minutes. I heard him discussing snowfall, cars, and train schedules.\n[2004-06-01 18:34:00] living room at home | I saw him hang up and look at me. I heard him explain that he was going skiing with friends over the weekend, and an elderly man had been helping them arrange a cabin.\n[2004-06-01 18:35:00] living room at home | I heard myself say to him, 'Sounds nice.' I recalled the years in high school and at college when having no friends had always been a hidden ache. I thought that although I’m now old enough not to care about such things, I could still feel a sharp pang—as if mourning for my younger self.\n[2004-06-01 18:40:00] living room at home | I saw him put the phone back into his pocket and place the cup on the table. I noticed the photographer was putting his equipment back into the camera bag. I asked, \"Are we leaving now?\"\n[2004-06-01 18:45:00] home / stairwell | I saw everyone standing together, putting on their coats to head out. I said goodbye to Nils Nils, then watched as everyone went downstairs and left. I heard no one say anything. I felt the hallway was too narrow, and they were standing too close to me, which made me slightly uncomfortable.\n[2004-06-01 18:50:00] front steps of the house | I lit a cigarette on the front steps. I noticed the photographer pulled me across the street, watching as he posed me for several minutes while I shielded the cigarette with my hand. I heard the photographer say, if I didn't mind, he'd like to include the cigarette in the shot. I felt the biting cold.\n[2004-06-01 18:55:00] street / tunnel entrance | I stood on the steps smoking, hearing the shutter click repeatedly, moving as he directed. I noticed passersby watching all this. Then, I watched as we walked to the tunnel entrance, where he took photos for another five minutes. I understood what he meant—he wanted to add more of a sense of everyday life.\n[2004-06-01 19:05:00] subway | I watched the photographer leave, then silently moved forward with the journalist. I noticed we crossed over the hill and down the slope to the subway station. I saw a train pull in, and then we boarded, sitting opposite each other by the window.\n[2004-06-01 19:10:00] subway | I said to him, \"Taking the subway still reminds me of the Leivik Cup that year. When I smell that particular scent in the hall, I'm reminded I come from a small town. The subway was the strangest invention back then. And Pepsi—back then we had neither.\" I heard him ask, \"You played football for a long time?\" I realized I came from a small town, where there had been no subways or Pepsi.\n[2004-06-01 19:12:00] subway | I told him, \"Until I was eighteen. But I wasn't good—very low level. All of it.\" I heard him press further, \"Is everything you do at a low level? You said you haven't even read your own book. In past interviews, you've talked about how terrible you are. Aren't you being a bit too hard on yourself?\"\n[2004-06-01 19:13:00] subway | I replied, \"No, I don't think so. Though of course, it depends on how high your standards are.\"\n[2004-06-01 19:20:00] subway | I heard him ask, \"Do you think you could win an award?\" I responded, \"The Nordic Council?\" I saw the train emerge from the tunnel at Central Station. I noticed he was looking out the window.\n[2004-06-01 19:21:00] subway | I heard him say yes. I firmly answered \"no.\" Then I heard him ask, \"Well, who will?\" I told him it would be Anders Hellen Ster.\n[2004-06-01 19:22:00] subway | I heard him ask doubtfully, \"You seem very certain?\" I explained to him, \"It's a wonderful novel, written by a woman, and Finland hasn't won in a long time. She will definitely win.\"\n[2004-06-01 19:25:00] subway | I felt the carriage fall into silence once again. I noticed that the time before and after interviews always unsettles me. I thought, although I don't know him, he wants to lure me into revealing my deepest thoughts. I realized that even though conversation is unavoidable, there's no real connection between us. I thought of Inge, and decided to mark the wine bottle. I decided I'd do it tonight—if the level drops, I'll take it.",

    "text": "[2004-06-01 19:40:00] Pelikan Pub | I saw us arrive at Skanstull station. I noticed we walked silently toward the Pelikan pub. I watched as we sat down at an inner table. I heard us talk for an hour and a half about me and my work. I saw the city shimmering in the darkness around us.\n[2004-06-01 21:15:00] Pelikan Pub | I watched myself get up to leave. I noticed he stayed behind to linger a while longer. I sighed—after a long interview, I feel empty inside, like a drained ditch. I realized I had betrayed myself again.\n[2004-06-01 21:20:00] Pelikan Pub | I realized I was sitting there only because I had accepted being seen as \"an unusual person who wrote two good books.\" I thought that the premise of the interview was that everything I said mattered—even the most ordinary childhood stories became special simply because they came from a \"writer.\"\n[2004-06-01 21:25:00] Pelikan Pub | I learned that Leivik only published a good novel every ten to twenty years. I knew Tovevik's \"Fire and Flame\" came out in 1980, and Vethos's \"The Flock of Birds\" in 1957. I realized that although I accepted the premise of the interview, deep down I knew the truth. I felt like I was just sitting there blabbering, like a parrot.\n[2004-06-01 21:30:00] Pelikan Pub | I sighed—thousands of novels are published each year, but the truth is most of them are weak. I felt the problem lies in mediocre writers enjoying praise, living in false self-images. I realized I am one of them.\n[2004-06-01 21:35:00] Pelikan Pub | I realized the most important thing I've learned over the years is this: don't believe you're someone special, because I'm just an arrogant, mediocre little nobody. In this mediocre age, I feel anger and shame.\n[2004-06-01 21:40:00] Pelikan Pub | I told myself not to believe I have any exceptional qualities or worth. I thought I should just keep my head down and work. I realized that the sum of a lifetime's experience amounts to this: I'm just a nobody—that's the only truth I've ever gained.\n[2004-06-01 21:45:00] Pelikan Pub | I realized I've always focused on being likable, obsessively caring what others think. I thought media attention brings pleasure, but also pain—because I can't control how strangers perceive me. I sighed—when an interview's meaning gets twisted beyond correction, my self-image suffers unbearable shame.\n[2004-06-01 21:50:00] Pelican Pub | I realized that the desire for praise had overwhelmed my fear and ideals of integrity, causing me to continue with the interview. I recalled how I had wanted to refuse interviews while writing the book, but changed my mind under Ingeborg's influence. I lamented that although I used promotion as an excuse, deep down I felt like a prostitute rather than a writer.\n[2004-06-01 21:55:00] Pelican Pub | I reflected on my recent behavior and realized that I, too, had been talking about myself. Looking at writers like Tovevik or Flugstad, I found them upright and never self-referential, feeling they belonged to an exceedingly rare breed.\n[2004-06-01 22:05:00] subway station | I saw myself handing the ticket to the window. I noticed him stamp it and push it back to me. I watched myself take the elevator down to the subway, walk through the tunnel to the platform. I checked the time for the next train. Finally, I sat down on a bench. A blank-faced staff member came into view. I was standing on a narrow platform.\n[2004-06-01 22:06:00] subway station | I heard the journalist turn to me and ask, \"Who exactly are you?\" I remembered it was the late autumn when 'Out of This World' had just been published. I knew that NRK2's 'News' program wanted to interview me.\n[2004-06-01 22:07:00] subway station | I asked in return, \"What do you mean?\" I heard his reply: \"Bellson Hansen is a sage. Ciliavik Sand is a Labour Party writer. Sivvik is a drunken, promiscuous female writer. Who are you? I know nothing about you.\"\n[2004-06-01 22:08:00] subway station | I said, \"I don't know, I'm just an ordinary person.\" I heard him press me: \"Come on! You have to give me something. What have you done?\"\n[2004-06-01 22:10:00] subway station | I told him, \"Done a few odd jobs here and there. Went to school for a few days. You know...\" I heard his final statement: \"Ibsen said the strongest are those who stand alone. I think he was wrong.\" I learned that he used edited pauses and hesitations to portray my personality.\n[2004-06-01 22:15:00] subway station | I watched myself sitting on the bench, raising my arms and taking a deep breath. I recalled what I had said then, feeling heavily oppressed. I reflected: How could I have said such things? Did I really believe in myself at that moment?\n[2004-06-01 22:20:00] subway station | I realized that what I had expressed back then was actually my mother's belief. I thought that human relationships are in fact meant to erase individuality and suppress deviant behavior. I sighed—yes, Ibsen was right, and everything I see around me confirms it.\n[2004-06-01 22:25:00] subway station | I recalled that my mother had never been as angry as when we discussed the concept of freedom. I remembered how she would always scoff at my opinions, calling them hollow, hypocritical American nonsense. I realized it was precisely this idea of 'living for others' that led to our today's institutionalized existence, making life feel like a tunnel already filtered on the very first day.\n[2004-06-01 22:30:00] subway station | I thought about how some people are sent to do practical work while others rise to the top. I realized it's precisely this idea of equal education that gives us false expectations about life, making us quick to blame external factors when things don't go smoothly. I saw the anger people directed at the state when the tsunami came, and I sighed at how tragic it was. I realized that the kind of existence where one faces life-threatening emergencies directly no longer exists in our time.\n[2004-06-01 22:35:00] subway station | I realized that such thinking has given rise to a culture where mediocrity can flourish through clichés. I thought of those revered writers who speak of writing tools as if they were Virgil reborn, and I felt disgusted by it all. Yet I blamed myself, remembering who it was that had talked to journalists about my own mediocre work as if I were truly a master—only to realize it was me.\n[2004-06-01 22:40:00] subway station | I realized that once I knew I wasn't doing good enough work, I could no longer bear others' applause. I cried out inwardly that I must sever all ties with this corrupt, flattering cultural world—even if it meant locking myself in a room for twenty years to write. I wanted to cut myself off from that hollow media world and pursue literature at the highest level.\n[2004-06-01 22:45:00] subway station | I realized I couldn't seize this opportunity because I had to remain present for my family and friends. I reflected on the weakness in my character—how I always say 'yes' to avoid hurting others, even abandoning principles to prevent conflict. In sorrow, I thought to myself that I was essentially a prostitute.\n[2004-06-01 23:15:00] home | I walked through the door and, as soon as I shut it behind me, leaned forward to look into the living room. I saw Siv Ingrid together with Nils Nils. I heard their voices talking in the living room. Before me, each held a cup of tea, curled up on the sofa. I noticed a candelabra with three lit candles on the table, along with plates and baskets filled with cheese and biscuits.\n[2004-06-01 23:16:00] living room at home | I shrugged and said. I heard Nils Nils ask me, 'Hey, Grete Lundnes, how’s it going?' I replied that it was okay, nothing worth mentioning. She asked if I wanted tea and cheese, and I answered, 'No, thank you.'\n[2004-06-01 23:20:00] living room at home | I stood there untying my scarf, hung my jacket in the closet, and placed my shoes on the shoe rack. Then I walked into the living room. I saw the floor below covered in dirt and gravel. I thought I should sit with them for a while so as not to seem too cold or distant.\n[2004-06-01 23:25:00] living room at home | I heard Siv Ingrid talking about her meeting with Culture Minister Olaflund. She told me the minister was an extremely small man sitting in a huge sofa, who even bit the cushion he held in his arms. I heard her genuine admiration for his sharp mind and strong work ability.\n[2004-06-01 23:30:00] living room at home | As far as I knew, Siv Ingrid had secured one high-level position after another shortly after turning thirty. I learned she had a close relationship with her father, while her relationship with her mother—who lived in Gothenburg—was rather complicated. I wasn't quite sure about her qualifications, but I realized the positions suited her well. I observed that she, like many young women I'd met, was well-bred and carried herself with confidence.\n[2004-06-01 23:35:00] living room at home | I heard Siv Ingrid recount a dream: she went to a party and left completely naked from the waist down, waddling like Donald Duck, and finally ended up lying across a table. She asked us what we thought the dream meant. I recalled this story that had clearly left a deep impression on her. I realized that although she frequently changed boyfriends, none of them measured up to her. I thought that the content of this dream—the fact she was willing to share it publicly—had a strangely charming awkwardness to it.\n[2004-06-01 23:40:00] living room at home | I wondered about the meaning of that dream. I thought about why she would make such a private matter public. I realized that beneath her worldly demeanor, there were often traces of childishness. I wondered whether this display that caught my surprised gaze was intentional.\n[2004-06-01 23:45:00] living room at home | I learned that Siv Ingrid was Vanja's godmother and had attended the child's naming ceremony. I knew she had made an excellent impression on my mother. I realized she held Nils Nils in high regard and sometimes even sought his advice. I felt she was very proactive within our small family, infecting us with joy and energy. I thought, from her perspective, this might be the only way to visit a vulnerable friend.\n[2004-06-01 23:50:00] living room at home | I noticed that as the party was winding down, Siv Ingrid got up to help clear the plates. I realized this was exactly why we needed social norms—because they help us coexist peacefully. I observed that Siv Ingrid behaved sensibly, while Nils Nils never reached the same degree. I thought that despite Nils Nils not understanding these things, there was an unknown richness in her character.\n[2004-06-01 23:55:00] living room at home | I felt sad inside because my mother preferred Siv Ingrid and failed to see the sudden dangers and resistance in Nils Nils’s character. I weighed in my mind how Nils Nils refused to serve others yet longed to be served. I wondered: should one choose the movement toward life, or the kind of death that resides in art?",

    "text": "[2004-06-01 23:58:00] living room at home / kitchen | I walked into the kitchen. I said, 'I'll have a cup of tea after all.' I heard Nils Nils say it was herbal tea, asked if I wanted some, and mentioned the water might still be warm. I replied, 'No, never mind.'\n[2004-06-01 23:59:00] kitchen at home | Before the water boiled, I stepped onto the chair in front of the cupboard, took a pencil, and marked all the liquor bottles. I drew a tiny dot so small only I would know it was there.\n[2004-06-02 00:01:00] kitchen at home | I realized I was behaving like a suspicious father and felt somewhat foolish. But I didn’t want the woman caring for my child to drink hard liquor while working, so I had to do it.\n[2004-06-02 00:05:00] kitchen at home / at the computer | I put a tea bag into the cup and poured hot water. I left the kitchen to say goodbye to Siv Ingrid, who was leaving. Then I sat down at the computer. I looked down at Naren Restaurant and saw chefs washing the floor, steam rising from the dishwasher.\n[2004-06-02 00:10:00] at the computer | I connected to the internet and checked my email, finding nothing. Then I visited several websites and searched for my own name on Google. I noticed the search results numbered over twenty-nine thousand, fluctuating like an exponential curve. I saw one online commenter say my book wasn't even good enough to wipe one's ass with.\n[2004-06-02 00:15:00] at the computer | I accidentally opened a bunch of documents. I found a review about me on the website of a small publishing house. As far as I knew, one of my relatives had been involved in a neighborhood dispute over the length of a garage wall.\n[2004-06-02 00:16:00] in front of the computer | I heard Nils Nils ask from behind me, \"What are you doing?\" I replied that I was googling myself. I exclaimed to her, \"This is fucking Pandora's box. You wouldn't believe what these people have written.\"\n[2004-06-02 00:17:00] in front of the computer | I heard her say, \"You shouldn't do that—come over and sit down.\" I answered, \"Coming, just two more things to check.\"\n[2004-06-02 08:00:00] home / writing room | I left for the writing room at eight in the morning the next day and returned home at three thirty in the afternoon. I knew Inge would come to pick up Vannia. I realized I'd be writing my lecture in the writing room until three o'clock.\n[2004-06-02 15:35:00] kitchen at home | I walked into the kitchen to inspect the wine bottles. I confirmed with certainty that someone had drunk from both bottles.\n[2004-06-02 15:40:00] bathroom at home | I went to find Nils Nils and sat down on the toilet lid. I heard her smile and say to me, \"Hi, I bought a bath bomb today.\" I saw the bathtub full of soap bubbles. I noticed Nils Nils raised one arm, and foam dripped down.\n[2004-06-02 15:41:00] bathroom at home | I looked at her. I said to her, \"I see that. There's something we need to talk about.\" I told her, \"It was your mom. Remember how I mentioned lately that the wine in the bottles has clearly gone down?\"\n[2004-06-02 15:42:00] bathroom at home | I told her I had marked the bottles yesterday, so I could be sure the wine had gone down again. I said that since I hadn't drunk any, it must have been either her or her mother. I heard my own firm conclusion: \"I know it wasn't you. That leaves only her—there's no other explanation.\"\n[2004-06-02 15:43:00] bathroom at home | I heard her ask, somewhat surprised, \"Mother?\" She remarked that this must have been going on for years, as it would explain her mother’s long-standing, uncommunicative absentmindedness. I noticed Nils Nils fell into deep thought.\n[2004-06-02 15:44:00] bathroom at home | I stood up. I told her it might stem from her mother's unhappiness due to problems with Vidar. I asked if she wanted to confront her now and settle it once and for all. I knew they would be home in half an hour.\n[2004-06-02 15:46:00] bathroom at home | I heard Nils Nils murmur, \"This must have been going on for years.\" Then she analyzed aloud that this actually explained many things, such as her mother’s persistent, unreachable absentmindedness. I noticed she fell silent. I looked at her, realizing she was lost in her own thoughts.\n[2004-06-02 15:47:00] bathroom at home | I stood up. I tried to speculate, 'It's not certain—maybe she has something going on with Vidar, maybe she's gotten into trouble there, unhappy.'\n[2004-06-02 15:48:00] bathroom at home | I heard Nils Nils retort, 'But you don't start drinking at sixty because you're unhappy.' She said it firmly to me, as if this were a well-established coping mechanism, one that had been used for a long time.\n[2004-06-02 15:49:00] bathroom at home | I told Nils Nils, 'They'll be home in half an hour.' I asked her advice—should we stay quiet for now and talk later, or confront her immediately and settle things once and for all?\n[2004-06-02 15:50:00] bathroom at home | I heard Nils Nils reply sharply, 'There's no point waiting.' Then she looked at me and asked, 'Can we do it together?'\n[2004-06-02 15:51:00] bathroom at home | I saw Nils Nils shrug at me, spreading her hands beneath the bath foam. I shook my head and replied, 'It's too complicated—two against one, like a courtroom.' I heard her mutter, 'Hmm, I don't know either.'\n[2004-06-02 15:52:00] bathroom at home | I volunteered, 'I'll do it. I'll go out and talk to her.' I heard her ask me, somewhat anxiously, whether I was really sure I wanted to do this.\n[2004-06-02 15:53:00] bathroom at home | I raised my voice and said, 'Want to? Of all things in the world, this is what I want to do least!' I exclaimed—it was my mother-in-law, after all. I explained to Nils Nils that I just wanted to handle it decently, without losing face, calmly clarifying everything. I inwardly sighed—this situation truly gave me a massive headache.\n[2004-06-02 15:54:00] bathroom at home | I heard Nils Nils say she was glad I was doing this, and guessed that in the end, her mother might admit it. I remarked to Nils Nils, 'I have to say, you're taking this remarkably calmly.'\n[2004-06-02 15:56:00] bathroom at home\n[2004-06-02 15:57:00] bathroom at home | I saw her smile at me, then shake her head. I repeated, somewhat sensitively, \"The children?\" I asked if there was something she knew that I didn't. I heard her reply that there wasn't, but that she could probably sense something.\n[2004-06-02 16:00:00] living room at home | I walked out of the bathroom and closed the door. I watched Nils Nils walk into the hallway, saw the red towel wrapped around her head. Then I saw her disappear behind the open cabinet door. I stood by the living room window, hearing the sound of water draining from the bathtub. I saw the torch outside the café across the street swaying in the wind, silhouettes passing along the road. The faint strumming of a guitar from the upstairs neighbor reached my ears, and dim streetlight cast its glow upon the walls and floor. I wondered to myself whether Nils Nils would feel unsettled if she walked in and saw all this.\n[2004-06-02 16:15:00] at computer at home / kitchen / hallway | I went to check my email, looked for a while, then turned off the computer. I went into the kitchen and turned on the coffee machine, then drank a glass of water. I noticed Nils Nils standing in front of the mirror in the hallway, putting on makeup.\n[2004-06-02 16:20:00] hallway at home | I asked her, \"When is Kristina arriving?\" I heard her reply that it was at six, but she wanted to get things ready while we were still alone. She asked me in return whether I'd made any progress today, and I told her only a little—there was still more to do tomorrow night and Friday.\n[2004-06-02 16:21:00] hallway at home | I saw her tilt her head back, brushing her lashes with a small brush. I heard her ask while brushing her lashes, \"You're leaving Saturday?\" I answered yes.",

    "text": "[2004-06-02 16:30:00] at home | I noticed the elevator in the corridor starting up. After it stopped, I saw the door facing the corridor open, and then I saw the stroller being pulled outward. I heard the sound of the stroller's wheels turning in the corridor. I figured they must have returned.\n[2004-06-02 16:31:00] hallway at home | I watched Ingeri open the door and step into the hallway inside the apartment. I heard Ingeri excitedly tell me that Vanya had fallen asleep on the way, poor little thing was completely worn out. She said they’d had a very rewarding day at June Mountain, and she’d bought an annual pass that allowed our whole family free entry. I felt the hallway instantly fill with her lively, vibrant energy.\n[2004-06-02 16:32:00] hallway at home | I saw her put down the various bags she was carrying. I noticed her pull a yellow card from her wallet and hand it to Nils Nils. Then I saw her rummaging through one of the bags. I heard her ask whether buying that new jumpsuit was a good idea, saying the old one had become too small.\n[2004-06-02 16:33:00] hallway at home | I saw her look at me, and I shook my head at her. I watched as she pulled out a pair of bright red new gloves from the bag and handed them to us. I heard her explain that these gloves had clips so they could be attached to sleeves—warm and spacious.\n[2004-06-02 16:34:00] hallway at home | I saw her look at Nils Nils. I heard Ingeri ask Nils Nils if she was going out. Realizing there was an evening appointment, she turned to me and said that Karl and I should think hard about how to spend our time, and that she’d leave now not to disturb us.\n[2004-06-02 16:35:00] hallway at home | I saw her turn toward Vanya. I noticed the little girl lying in the stroller, her hat covering her eyes. I heard her whisper that Vanya would probably sleep another hour, and she asked if I wanted to carry the child into the living room first.\n[2004-06-02 16:36:00] hallway at home | I said, \"Let me carry it.\" I asked Inge whether she was returning to Gnestad or had other plans. I heard her reply that she was going to the theater with Barbro and asked if she could stay another night in my study, wondering if I needed it.\n[2004-06-02 16:37:00] hallway at home | I saw her large eyes behind thick lenses staring at me with suspicion and unease. I quickly said, \"No, no, I was just asking. Actually, I wanted to talk to you. There's something I need to say.\"\n[2004-06-02 16:38:00] hallway at home | I asked, \"Can we go out for a walk?\" I heard her answer, \"Okay.\" I suggested, \"Then let's go now. It won't take long.\"\n[2004-06-02 16:40:00] home | I bent down, loosened the bolts, held both doors open, and pushed the stroller inside. I saw Inge go into the kitchen for water. I stood a few meters away waiting for her. I noticed Nils Nils had gone into the living room. I felt my mind racing with thoughts.\n[2004-06-02 16:42:00] stairwell | I watched us step out of the apartment. I noticed her face turned pale as she spoke. I heard her nervously ask me, \"You're not splitting up, are you? Don't tell me you're separating...\"\n[2004-06-02 16:43:00] stairwell | I quickly reassured her, \"No, oh no, we're not. There's something else I want to talk to you about.\" I heard her sigh with relief, saying, \"Oh, then I'm relieved.\"\n[2004-06-02 16:45:00] street | I watched us walk through the backyard and out the gate. She didn't say anything along the way. I noticed she glanced at me from time to time. I walked along the quiet David's Baker Street. I thought about the nursing home and noticed a look of expectation or surprise in her eyes.\n[2004-06-02 16:47:00] street | I saw us walking toward St. Helen Ster Church. After a silence, I finally heard myself say, \"I really don't know how to begin.\"\n[2004-06-02 16:48:00] street | I confessed to Inge, \"But this... well, I'd better be direct. I know you drank while watching Vanya today. You drank yesterday too. I... well, I simply can't allow that. It's not right. You mustn't do it.\" I reflected inwardly that I should just speak plainly.\n[2004-06-02 16:49:00] street | I saw us continuing to walk, her eyes fixed on me. I went on, \"I never want to control you—of course you can do as you please. But not when you're caring for Vanya. I have to draw a line. It's not acceptable, do you understand?\"\n[2004-06-02 16:50:00] street | I heard her say in surprise, \"I don't understand. I have no idea what you're talking about. I've never drunk alcohol while taking care of Vanja. Never. And I never will. Where did you get such a conclusion?\"\n[2004-06-02 16:51:00] street | I felt a deep chill inside. I thought that whenever I find myself in a precarious or agonizing situation—like today, when forced into actions beyond my intentions—the way I observe the world around me (including myself) becomes unusually clear, almost surreal in its clarity.\n[2004-06-02 16:52:00] street | I noticed my slightly hunched posture and Inge's lively gait beside me. I saw the way she tilted her face up toward mine—beyond confusion, there seemed to be a faint trace of barely perceptible reproach. Ahead, the green tin spire of the church came into view, surrounded by black, bare trees in the cemetery. I saw a shiny blue compact car gliding along the opposite side of the road.\n[2004-06-02 16:53:00] street | I heard myself explain to her, \"I noticed the wine level in the bottle had gone down. To check, I marked the label yesterday. When I got home, I saw it had decreased again. I haven't touched it at all. Besides me, only you and Nils Nils were home today. I know it wasn't Nils Nils. That leaves only one explanation—it must have been you.\"\n[2004-06-02 16:54:00] street | I heard her say to me, \"There must be another explanation, because it wasn't me. I'm truly sorry, Grete Lundnes, but I didn't drink your wine.\"\n[2004-06-02 16:55:00] street | I said to her, \"Listen, you're my mother-in-law, and I only want the best for you. I don't want this—I really don't. The last thing I want is to accuse you. But what else can I do? I already know the truth!\" I felt a stabbing pain, as if stepping through the gates of hell.\n[2004-06-02 16:56:00] street | I heard her say to me, \"But you don't know—because it wasn't me.\" I sighed inwardly. This kind of pain was truly unbearable.\n[2004-06-02 16:58:00] street | I said seriously to Inge, \"You must understand—regardless of what you say, this has consequences. You're an excellent mother-in-law, and I know Vanja is deeply attached to you. But if you won't admit this, we can't trust you anymore. It doesn't mean we won't see you, but if you don't confess and promise not to repeat it, you can't be left alone with her. Do you understand what I'm saying?\" I knew Vanja was closer to her than to anyone else, and that we had no other close family nearby. I thought how happy I would be if things could continue as they were.\n[2004-06-02 16:59:00] street | I heard her say to me, \"Yes, I understand. It's such a pity. But it can't be helped—I can't admit to something I didn't do. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.\"\n[2004-06-02 17:00:00] street | I suggested, \"Alright then, let's not talk about this anymore. Let's just set it aside for now and see what comes next.\" I heard her reply, \"That's fine, but nothing will change—you understand that.\" I answered, \"Okay.\"\n[2004-06-02 17:05:00] street | I saw us walking down the steps in front of the French School, then along Deben Street to St. Helen Ster Square, finally onto Baker David Street. I noticed myself striding forward with a hunched back, while Inge nearly had to trot beside me. Everything around was silent; we didn’t speak at all along the way.\n[2004-06-02 17:06:00] street | I sighed inwardly—things shouldn't have turned out this way. She's my mother-in-law; I have no reason to punish her. This whole situation felt meaningless, especially when she flatly denied it, which made it even more dreary.",

    "text": "[2004-06-02 17:10:00] front door | I saw myself inserting the key into the lock to open the door for her, watching her give a slight smile as she stepped inside. I wondered how she could remain so calm and confident. I even began to doubt whether Nils Nils was right, but immediately told myself not to jump to conclusions. Maybe I’d misread the mark? No, I didn’t think so. My mind was full of conflict.\n[2004-06-02 17:11:00] yard | I greeted the beautician in white, seeing her respond with a smile. I saw Inge pause by the building entrance, waiting for me to open the door. The beautician came into view, smoking in the yard.\n[2004-06-02 17:12:00] stairwell | I heard her say to me as we climbed the stairs: 'I'm leaving now. It's up to you. We'll talk about it later. Maybe by then you’ll figure out what really happened.'\n[2004-06-02 17:13:00] stairwell | I saw her take her bag and two plastic bags. I noticed she smiled goodbye just like always, but this time she didn’t hug me as she usually did.\n[2004-06-02 17:15:00] hallway at home | I saw Nils Nils walk into the hallway after Inge left. I heard Nils Nils urgently ask me, 'Well? What did she say?' I told her, 'She said she didn’t drink when she was with Vanja. She doesn’t know why the bottle level dropped.'\n[2004-06-02 17:16:00] hallway at home | I heard Nils Nils say, 'If she’s an alcoholic, denial is part of the behavior.' I replied, 'Maybe, but what can we actually do? She insists she didn’t do it. I have no proof—we don’t have cameras in the kitchen.'\n[2004-06-02 17:17:00] hallway at home | I heard Nils Nils tell me, 'As long as we know, it’s not that big a deal. If she tries to play games, she has to face the consequences.' I asked what consequences. I heard her suggest, 'We could stop letting her be alone with Vanja.'\n[2004-06-02 17:18:00] hallway at home | I heard myself curse, 'Damn it, what a mess.' I remarked that I never expected to end up arguing with my mother-in-law about whether she’d been drinking. Nils Nils’ voice came from nearby, saying she was glad I’d confronted her—maybe she’d admit it. I replied, 'I don’t think she will.'\n[2004-06-02 17:20:00] at home | I learned that three years ago I was still living in Baysang, knowing nothing about Halvik and not recognizing anyone here. I inwardly marveled at how quickly a life could take root in a new place, and how swiftly a stranger could become part of a new city.\n[2004-06-02 17:25:00] at home | I realized that since coming to Halvik, this city full of foreigners, my life had gradually become intertwined with theirs. I recognized that this intertwining could no longer be undone. I thought that if I had gone to Shannest instead, the same thing would have happened there. I reflected that all of this was both accidental and fated.\n[2004-06-03 10:00:00] at home | I heard her relay over the phone that she herself didn't take the matter too seriously, but since we did, she would take necessary steps to ensure no further discomfort. I learned that Inge called Nils Nils the next day and admitted everything.\n[2004-06-03 10:05:00] at home | From what I understand, Inge had already scheduled an appointment with an alcohol counselor and decided to spend more time focusing on her own needs. I knew she believed the problem lay in the immense pressure she had put on herself.\n[2004-06-03 10:10:00] at home | I saw Nils Nils sink into despair after hanging up the phone. I realized she felt her mother was overly optimistic and eager, making genuine communication impossible. I thought that Inge seemed to have lost touch with reality, living instead in a fantasy world filled with bright illusions of the future.\n[2004-06-03 10:15:00] at home | I heard Nils Nils confide in me: 'I can't talk to her! There's no real communication!' She told me her mother acted as if everything were fine, even praising the way I handled the situation, while ignoring the conflict that had just occurred the day before. I heard her voice laced with worry, saying her mother was suppressing pain and suffering yet refused to admit anything was wrong with her life. She lamented that her mother should be enjoying her later years in peace, yet she herself felt powerless to help.\n[2004-06-03 10:15:00] at home | I said to her: 'But you're her daughter—of course she doesn't want your help.' I explained that she'd spent her whole life helping others, and if she started accepting help from you now, her sense of self might fall apart. I heard her reply: 'You're right. But I just want to talk to her.' I responded: 'I understand.'\n[2004-06-13 20:30:00] Folkehøgskole outside Sjøheim | I saw us park the car in front of the folk high school two hours later. I was about to give a reading here. I heard the car doors slam, their echoes reverberating against the walls. Before me stood the folk high school nestled in the forest outside Sjøheim. I noticed the sky had turned completely dark, with bright stars twinkling everywhere. I heard the rushing of a nearby river and the rustling of leaves, and I felt silence enveloping us.\n[2004-06-13 20:32:00] Folkehøgskole outside Sjøheim | I heard Karl Larsdal ask doubtfully, 'Are you sure this is the place? In the middle of the forest? Who on earth would come here to listen to you read?' I replied, 'Who cares.' I asked him whether he didn't think the place had atmosphere, and I heard him say, 'Oh, it does. It's quite atmospheric.'\n[2004-06-13 20:35:00] Folkehøgskole outside Sjøheim | I saw us walk through the gate, our footsteps crunching on the gravel path. I saw a large white wooden house, another wooden building set perpendicularly to it, and three windows glowing with light. Through the windows, I spotted two silhouettes—one playing a piano, the other a violin. To the right stood another building, unlit, resembling a large barn. I knew the wooden house appeared to be from the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, and that the unlit building was where the reading would take place.\n[2004-06-13 20:40:00] Folkehøgskole outside Sandeim | I watched as we wandered around for a few minutes, peering now and then into the dark windows. I saw us walk along a path up to a stone bridge. Before me lay a library and a space resembling a living room. Beneath the bridge flowed a small river with black water, and across it, the forest rose like a dark wall.\n[2004-06-13 20:45:00] Folkehøgskole outside Sandeim | I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, \"We should get a cup of coffee or something.\" I suggested, \"Why don't we ask those two if they have the key?\" Then I said to him, \"No, we won't ask anyone, nothing at all. The person in charge will come when they're supposed to.\"\n[2004-06-13 20:46:00] Folkehøgskole outside Sandeim | I saw Karl Larsdal begin speaking to me. I heard Karl Larsdal say, \"At least we could warm ourselves up a bit—you can't possibly object to that, can you?\" I answered him, \"Alright.\"\n[2004-06-13 20:50:00] Wooden cabin at Folkehøgskole | I saw us enter the narrow house. I noticed there were two young musicians—a girl with a beautiful and gentle face, and a boy covered in pimples. The sound of music from the two young musicians echoed in my ears. I noticed the boy seemed irritated and clumsy. I learned they were probably only sixteen or seventeen years old. I felt as though the boy was unhappy about seeing us.\n[2004-06-13 20:51:00] Wooden cabin at Folkehøgskole | I saw her shake her head at me. I asked, \"Do you have the key to the main gate? He's supposed to give a reading—we arrived a bit early.\" I heard her reply that we could wait in the next room, where there was a coffee machine.\n[2004-06-13 21:00:00] Wooden cabin at Folkehøgskole | I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, \"I feel like I'm on an outing. The lights here, the cold and darkness outside, and this forest. And nobody knows where I am or what I'm doing—yes, it feels liberating. But there's also so much darkness.\" I sensed that the atmosphere here was somewhat special.\n[2004-06-13 21:02:00] Wooden cabin at Folkehøgskole | I raised one hand into the air, trembling with it like an old man. I asked, \"Did you see it?\"",

    "text": "[2004-06-13 21:30:00] Folkehøgskole auditorium | Half an hour later, I saw us being led into the auditorium. I saw a teacher-like figure greet me and shake my hand. I watched as we walked into the room. I heard the elderly host, nearly sixty, say to me, \"Quite impressive, isn't it?\" I knew he was a teacher with a full beard and glasses.\n[2004-06-13 21:35:00] Folkehøgskole auditorium | I nodded. I saw that the barn had been converted into a large auditorium, with various artworks hanging on the walls. I felt as though it was like a spaceship, designed for optimal acoustics. I learned it could seat two hundred people. I thought to myself, this country really does have a lot of money now.\n[2004-06-13 21:40:00] Folkehøgskole auditorium / riverside | I placed my bag beside the lectern, took out paper and books, and shook hands with the elderly female bookseller and others. Then I went downstairs for a walk in the dark, walking down to the riverside where I smoked two cigarettes in succession. Afterwards, I went into the toilet, sat with my head in my hands for fifteen minutes. I knew the bookseller would set up her stall after the talk.\n[2004-06-13 22:00:00] People's High School Auditorium | I saw that when I returned, several people were already seated in the auditorium. I noticed a brass band performing. Baroque music played by the brass band echoed in my ears. I learned there were about forty or fifty audience members. I knew they had come specially on Friday evening to listen to music in the heart of the forest.\n[2004-06-13 22:30:00] Stage of People's High School Auditorium | I stepped to the center of the stage, faced everyone’s gaze, took a sip of water, opened my notes, and began speaking. At first I stammered, my voice trembling, but eventually I found my rhythm. I heard waves of laughter ripple through the audience as I spoke. I felt how attentively the audience was listening—their interest fueled me. A sense of joy welled up inside me; having such like-minded listeners felt truly uplifting.\n[2004-06-13 23:30:00] People's High School Auditorium | I sat down to sign books, watching as each person came over to discuss the topic with me. In the end, I followed Karl Larsdal toward the parking area and got into the car. I heard them tell me passionately how deeply my words had resonated with them. I stared at the road stretching into the dark countryside. I could see clearly that I had stirred something in them. But as I walked toward the car, I felt myself sinking back down—returning to my ordinary world, where indifference and scorn were the norm.\n[2004-06-13 23:40:00] Inside the Saab | I heard Karl Larsdal say to me: 'Well done—you're really good at this. I don't understand all your earlier complaints. You could go around doing this and make money.' I replied, 'It was fine, but I gave them what they wanted. I said what they wanted to hear. I catered to them.' I realized I was catering to everything and everyone.\n[2004-06-13 23:45:00] Inside the Saab | I heard Karl Larsdal say: 'There was a woman ahead of us—seemed like a teacher. When you mentioned child abuse, she stiffened right up. But then when you circled back to infantilization, she nodded. That concept she can accept—it covers everything up.' Then he asked sharply, 'If not infantilization, then isn’t it pedophilia?'\n[2004-06-13 23:50:00] Inside the Saab | I saw him burst into laughter, so I closed my eyes. I heard Karl Larsdal exclaim: 'Absolutely magical—darkness, stars, and the rustling in the trees.' I responded, 'Yes, exactly.'\n[2004-06-14 00:30:00] Tjeldøya, Aucity | I saw us driving outside Vesfjord, crossing bridges, passing the zoo and several small towns, finally entering Aucity. I walked into a bar at Tjeldøya and drank a beer. I felt inexplicably adrift, lost in a melancholy mood.\n[2004-06-14 00:45:00] Tjeldøya, Aucity | I was surrounded by the familiar buildings near the harbor. I looked across the strait at Rocky’s silhouette. I knew this was a world crowded with my personal memories. I felt an emotion that was both pleasant and unfamiliar. I thought this feeling certainly didn’t come from Karl Larsdal—I always associated him with that period of my life in Halvik.\n[2004-06-14 01:00:00] Hissøy / Karl Larsdal's childhood home | Around midnight, I watched as we drove onto Hissøy and approached the old house where he grew up. I saw him park the car outside the garage. I took my backpack and bouquet from the trunk and followed him toward the house. I knew the house resembled mine in style—at least it was built around the same time. He pointed out to me the dock where he used to hang out as a boy, but I couldn’t summon any real interest.\n[2004-06-14 01:05:00] Hallway of Karl Larsdal's childhood home | I followed his suggestion and placed my bouquet into a vase. I heard him say to me: 'Just had a funeral—you can see that. If you’d like, I can put yours in the vase too.' I saw the hallway filled with flowers and wreaths.\n[2004-06-14 01:15:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home | I watched as he showed me the room prepared for my overnight stay. Then I saw us eat a few sandwiches in the kitchen. I wandered through the two living rooms. I learned that the room was actually his brother Tove Peternes’s.\n[2004-06-14 01:20:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home | I saw many family photos on the walls and large sets of ornaments on the windowsills. I noticed long runner rugs and small area rugs on the floor, along with various tablecloths. I observed that the furniture and photographs carried a 1950s inland Norwegian feel. I had often heard Karl Larsdal say that his parents belonged to the generation before mine. I knew this house from the 1970s had been decorated to resemble a household from the 1950s. As I took in how they had arranged their home, I realized what he meant.\n[2004-06-14 01:25:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home | I went out onto the lawn and smoked a cigarette, then we said goodnight. I went to bed. I recalled entering houses shortly after someone had died—how chaotic those usually felt—and marveled that this place seemed untouched. I felt reluctant to close my eyes, afraid of seeing things I’d seen before, but forced myself to think of neutral topics in an attempt to fall asleep.\n[2004-06-14 07:00:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home | At seven the next morning, I was woken by noises from upstairs. I took a shower, got dressed, and went up. I knew it was Njål and Kristina getting up.\n[2004-06-14 07:15:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home kitchen | I saw an old man come out of the kitchen to greet me. I spoke with him for a while. I saw his kind and gentle expression. I learned that this was Karl Larsdal’s father. I knew he was around seventy years old. I sensed a warmth of kindness radiating from him, yet also a hardness—I wondered inwardly if that was what people meant by backbone. We talked about my growing up here.\n[2004-06-14 07:30:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home living room | After a while, I saw his brother Tove Peternes come in, and we shook hands. I watched him sit down on the sofa and begin chatting casually. I noticed he was also friendly and gentle. I sensed a shyness in him, something completely absent in Karl Larsdal.\n[2004-06-14 08:00:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home living room | I watched the old man set up breakfast in the living room, and we sat down to eat. In the end, I stepped outside, letting out a long breath. I kept thinking that his wife—their mother—had only been buried yesterday, and staying here felt somehow inappropriate. I felt they treated me with great warmth and consideration, and though they welcomed me like an old friend, I still felt a sense of relief when I left.\n[2004-06-14 09:00:00] Karl Larsdal's childhood home | I watched as we climbed into the car and drove toward Rocky. I heard his father insist we stop by their place first. He said it was Saturday, time to go to the harbor and buy some shrimp, and that I absolutely had to try them before returning to Kristianvik. I heard myself reply that yes, we really must try them. I knew the flight was in the afternoon, and we had originally planned to drive around, making a trip to Rocky—a place I hadn’t visited in a long time.",

    "text": "[2004-06-14 09:30:00] Inside the Saab | I climbed into the car and watched as we drove toward Rocky. I listened to Karl Larsdal talk about the places we passed and the odd stories connected to them. I heard him speak about his family, his mother’s character, and about his father and brother. I felt a whole life emerging from this landscape.\n[2004-06-14 09:45:00] Inside the Saab | I said to Karl, 'It was interesting meeting them. Now I understand better what you’ve always been talking about. Your father and your brother—they have nothing of your temperament, your thoughts, or your curiosity. They’re just kind and warm. How do you even communicate? Your mother must have been more like you. Am I right?'\n[2004-06-14 09:50:00] inside the Saab | I heard Karl reply, 'Yes. I understand her, but that's precisely why I have to leave. It's a pity you never met her.' I told him I had come too late. I then heard him say that the most reliable link across three generations was probably the identical occipital bone he shared with Njål and Father.\n[2004-06-14 10:00:00] Rocky Bridge | I nodded. I watched the car climb the hill before Rocky Bridge and looked around. I saw Ylstad Island below, the distant Uvåg Bay, and Håvard’s house to the right. Before me lay mountains flattened and paved over with roads and industrial buildings. I noticed the forest below the bus stop—the slope we used to ski down in winter.\n[2004-06-14 10:15:00] Rocky North Hill Loop | I pointed outside and said, 'There.' I saw Old Søren’s house and the wild cherry tree—part of the residential area on the North Hill Loop. I saw him stop the car. I heard Karl ask me in surprise if I had lived there. I directed him to keep going forward. When he asked if it was that red house, I told him it had been brown when we lived there. I thought to myself, my God, it’s so small. I noticed how everything here seemed so tiny, so ugly.\n[2004-06-14 10:20:00] Rocky North Hill Loop | I saw a woman wearing an oversized down jacket pushing a stroller ahead of us. I saw the Olsen house, the little mound known as 'the Mountain,' and Siv’s and Karin Ingrid’s house. I said, 'There's nothing to see here—come on, let's keep going. Up the hill.' All I saw was nearly lifeless surroundings, except for a group of children far off.\n[2004-06-14 10:25:00] Rocky North Hill Loop | I heard Karl Larsdal ask if I was lost in thoughts. I replied, 'No, more like indifferent. It's too small here—nothing at all.' I heard him smile as he called my name and asked if we should keep going straight. I realized I had never felt this sense of 'nothing at all' before—even though back then, this place had been my entire world.\n[2004-06-14 10:40:00] Rocky Church | I watched the car drive toward the surrounding area. I heard Karl suggest taking a turn around the neighborhood. I suggested visiting Rocky Church and told him about its thirteenth-century structure and seventeenth-century gravestones adorned with skulls, hourglasses, and serpents. I remembered using one of those inscriptions as an epigraph in my first serious short story.\n[2004-06-14 11:00:00] Rocky Cemetery | I watched as we circled the church and walked into the cemetery. I wandered around, gazing out toward the sea. Pine trees stretched down to the pebble beach, growing smaller the closer they got to the sea wind. I realized I still felt indifferent—even in the face of these views.\n[2004-06-14 11:30:00] Rocky | I saw the fields where I had worked during summers and the path leading down to the sea. I saw Sandeim Bay and the teacher’s house. I noticed Fjellvik, the gas station, and the houses on the other side. I saw the supermarket. I said, 'Alright, let's go.' I recalled how, at the farewell party in that house, a female classmate had become unusually affectionate. I remembered how the supermarket looked during construction. I guessed the teacher must be nearly sixty by now.\n[2004-06-14 11:45:00] Rocky | I saw autumn winds swaying the tall, slender pine trees. I realized there was nothing left here—but looking at those houses, I knew people still lived inside them, were born, and died. I reflected that even though this place was small and ugly, to those who lived there, it was their entire world.\n[2004-06-14 13:00:00] Karl Larsdal's family living room | An hour later, I saw myself sitting at the dining table eating shrimp, with Karl’s father tending to me. I shook hands with them to say thank you. Then I got into the car, sat beside Karl, and watched as we drove toward the airport. I noticed he wasn’t eating anything himself, and realized he was simply happy that I could experience a taste of South Leivik before leaving.\n[2004-06-14 14:00:00] Tøyen | I saw that we had chosen the route via Bekkelaget, watching as Karl parked the car in front of that house. I saw him burst out laughing. I knew I wanted to see what my other childhood home in Tøyen looked like now.\n[2004-06-14 14:05:00] Tøyen | I heard him mock me for living somewhere in the middle of the forest, far from any town. I heard him remark how deserted it was, even making a joke about Twin Peaks, saying he’d been terrified of such places as a child.\n[2004-06-14 14:10:00] Tøyen | I heard myself trying to explain how beautiful our house used to be. I heard his impatient voice: 'Come on! Living here must feel like punishment.' I watched him laugh endlessly, and I started laughing too. I realized that through his eyes, I saw the place’s decay and poverty.\n[2004-06-14 14:15:00] Tøyen | I didn’t respond. I felt my pride wounded and wanted to defend myself, but in the end, I couldn’t be bothered. I realized that this inner light that made everything meaningful had no counterpart in the outside world.\n[2004-06-14 22:00:00] Kristianvik home | I watched myself shaking hands with him in the parking lot, seeing him climb into his car. I walked toward the terminal, went through two flight changes. I saw myself finally arriving home at ten o’clock in the evening.\n[2004-06-14 22:15:00] Kristianvik home living room | As soon as I came in, I felt Nils Nils give me a long hug. I saw us sitting together in the living room. I heard Nils Nils say she had felt better the day before, and suggested we do something to break the vicious cycle. I agreed, telling her this state couldn’t continue—we needed to forge a new path.\n[2004-06-14 23:30:00] Kristianvik home bedroom | I saw myself entering the bedroom at half past eleven, turning on the computer, creating a new file, and starting to write.\n[2004-06-15 00:00:00] Kristianvik home bedroom | I looked at my face in the windowpane, the left side of my face in shadow. I saw two deep furrows across my forehead, dark lines carved into my cheeks. I realized thirty years had passed since these words were first written. I gazed seriously into the eyes in the mirror, silently asking: What exactly has been inscribed upon this face?\n[2004-06-15 09:00:00] Kristianvik home | I watched myself continuing to write the next day. I made up my mind to get closer to life. I thought about writing into the book how Nils Nils looked when sleeping, how the children were doing at kindergarten, the view outside the window, and the music I was listening to.\n[2004-06-15 10:00:00] Hårvik | I learned that four months later he returned to Hårvik with a large stack of tapes. As far as I know, we resumed our friendship, and the previous frustration faded away.\n[2004-06-15 10:00:00] Ida Island | I saw myself sitting down to write while Nils Nils was taking care of the child. I knew the novel had to be finished within six weeks. Although I lied to my editor, saying I was only polishing it, I realized I had just begun to grasp the essence of the story.\n[2004-06-16 16:00:00] Rented Room | I saw myself going to the rented room to continue writing. Occasionally I walked into the garden to smoke, watching birds fly by. Before me lay the empty rental plots of February; I saw rows of neat little houses.",

    "text": "[2004-06-16 18:00:00] Garden of the Rented Room | I saw myself sitting quietly. I saw a hedgehog crawl past before I got up and went inside. I whispered to the hedgehog, \"Hi, hello there.\" Before me were flocks of crows gathering densely in the evening sky. I saw light spilling from the doorway, with darkness everywhere else around.\n[2004-06-17 09:00:00] Rented Room | I watched myself begin writing about my father leaving home. After returning home, I dug out my notes from when I was eighteen and continued writing. Although I hated every sentence, I thought I had to finish telling the story. I realized that 'beer bags in the ditch' could point toward my teenage years, and decided to abandon grandeur and just write.\n[2004-06-20 20:00:00] Ida Island | I saw myself writing like a madman. I watched myself eating with everyone, watching the game with Nils Nils, then typing alone late into the night.\n[2004-07-01 12:00:00] New Apartment/Writing Room | I realized I had to commit myself fully to the work. I told Nils Nils I would move to the writing room to work day and night. I heard her angrily demanding whether I had forgotten our family and summer. I answered firmly that yes, that was exactly what I intended. I heard her harsh prohibition, but replied indifferently that she could do as she liked—I insisted I had to do this.\n[2004-07-02 09:00:00] Oksenhof Writing Room | I saw myself falling into a frenzy of writing, sleeping only two or three hours a day. I saw myself even pulling the ringing phone away from my ear. I heard Nils Nils screaming furiously at me over the phone.\n[2004-07-10 14:00:00] Oksenhof Writing Room | I saw myself showing complete indifference toward the conflict. I heard her threaten to leave me and never let me see them again. I coldly replied, \"Go ahead,\" or \"Fine.\" I told her I had to write.\n[2004-07-15 15:00:00] Oksenhof Writing Room | I wrote twenty pages a day. I still wrote day and night without pause, and then I received her call. I heard Nils Nils shrieking over the phone, accusing me of always running away whenever problems arose, calling me an asshole, a heartless monster, the worst piece of shit in the world, cursing the day she ever met me. Then I heard her suddenly shift tone, asking if I wanted to pick her up at the station the next day. I realized I no longer saw words, sentences, or forms—only images and people filled my vision. I thought, if she wants to leave, let her go. I don't care. I must keep writing.\n[2004-07-16 12:00:00] Train Station | I agreed to meet her. At the station, I saw her walking toward me, Vanja asleep in the stroller. I watched her approach me. I said to her, \"Okay, I'll go.\" I heard her greet me briefly and ask how things were going. I told her, \"Fine.\" I heard her say she was sorry for everything that had happened.\n[2004-08-01 15:00:00] New apartment | Two weeks later, I called to say the novel was finished. When I got home, I saw her standing in the hallway with a glass of Prosecco for me. I noticed my favorite dishes laid out on the table. Before me was a warm scene, with my favorite music playing in the living room. I knew I had completed it by the publisher's deadline of August first. I felt it was almost a miracle.\n[2004-08-01 18:00:00] New apartment | I’ve written it. The novel is out. I realized that although the novel was complete, my experience wasn’t over yet. I felt I hadn’t stayed long enough in that state of writing.\n[2004-08-15 14:00:00] Brynglassenosen | I saw the plane arrive at Brynglassenosen, and I noticed Mom was already waiting for us there.\n[2004-08-20 12:00:00] Brynglassenosen | Over the next week, I watched as we took long walks beneath the beautiful mountains. Before me lay a picturesque landscape—everything looked perfect, exactly as it should be. I sensed that while everything was beautiful, it wasn't quite good enough for me. Deep inside, I longed to return to that mad, lonely, yet joyful state of writing. I missed it terribly.\n[2004-09-01 09:00:00] Hårvik/Apartment | I stayed home taking care of Vanja. I knew that after we returned to Mochengdao, Nils Nils had started his second year at the drama academy.\n[2004-09-01 09:10:00] Hårvik/Apartment | In the morning, I breastfed my daughter until she was completely full.\n[2004-09-01 12:00:00] Hårvik/Drama Academy | At lunchtime, I brought the baby to the drama academy and fed her again until she was full.\n[2004-09-01 16:00:00] Hårvik/Apartment | By the afternoon, I saw Nils Nils cycling home as fast as he could.\n[2004-09-15 10:00:00] Hårvik | I came to understand that when I moved to Hårvik and met Nils Nils that spring, the world suddenly opened up. I knew that state lasted for half a year. I recalled how during those six months I truly felt happiness—felt close to the world and to myself. That sense of fullness was overwhelming; I wanted to embrace everything. But I also realized that afterward, this feeling gradually lost its luster, and the world once again drew distant from me.\n[2004-09-15 11:00:00] Hårvik/City center | I pushed the stroller through the beautiful city center of Hårvik, accompanying my daughter. I saw my lover teaching at school. Before me was the beautiful urban scenery of Hårvik. I learned that my book had received excellent reviews, and several foreign publishers had acquired the rights. I thought I had nothing to complain about—everything was fine. I realized I loved my daughter more than anything. I could also feel my lover’s longing to be reunited with us.\n[2004-09-20 08:00:00] Halvik Hospital | I know that about six months later, that state returned—it was precisely the moment when Vanya was born.\n[2004-09-20 09:00:00] Halvik Home | As far as I know, that open world no longer existed. I knew Nils Nils had changed—compared to her former wildness, she now became cautious and careful. I thought about how we had shut the world outside. I realized I was completely absorbed in the present miracle, pouring endless care into everything.\n[2004-10-15 12:00:00] Halvik Street | I ran across the street into town to buy what we needed, then hurried back with my bags. I know this condition lasted for four or five weeks. I thought I didn’t want to miss even a single minute. I felt that everything was warm, filled with tenderness. I realized that whenever our daughter opened her eyes, we would rush to her side, marveling that she was awake. I felt that day and night had merged into one.\n[2004-11-15 03:30:00] Living Room at Home | We got up and walked into the living room. I heard Nils Nils suggest waiting until things quieted down before writing a friendly letter, showing generosity in it. But I also heard her complain that making such noise in the middle of the night was simply unacceptable. I thought it was nearly three-thirty. I was wondering what to do. I realized Nils Nils wanted to make a complaint call, but I didn’t want to, because I feared the neighbor might cause trouble later.\n[2004-11-15 05:00:00] Bedroom at Home | I watched Nils Nils lie down on the sofa. Then I went to bed. I saw her large pregnant belly rising high, heard her heavy breathing. Around five o’clock, I sensed the surroundings finally grew quiet—the music had stopped.\n[2004-11-16 09:00:00] Apartment Stairwell | I saw Nils Nils write the letter the next morning and slip it into the neighbor’s mailbox before leaving the house. I noticed that afterward, everything temporarily returned to peace.\n[2004-11-16 18:00:00] Front Door | I saw someone start pounding violently on my door, and I went over to open it. The Russian woman stood before me; I saw her arrogant face, ravaged by alcohol, now pale with rage. I noticed she tightly clutched the letter Nils Nils had written. I realized it was around six in the evening.\n[2004-11-16 18:00:10] Front Door | I heard her loudly confront me. I heard her scream: “What the hell is this! Who do you think you are? My own home! What I do is none of your business!”\n[2004-11-16 18:00:20] Front Door | I said to her: “It’s a very friendly letter…”\n[2004-11-16 18:00:30] Front Door | I heard her shout at me: “I’m not talking to you! I want to speak to the one in charge!”",

You get chased outside just to smoke a cigarette. You stand in the yard like a laughingstock. Do you think I don't see that? I'm going to talk to her.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:01:00] front door | I saw her step forward, trying to squeeze past me. I smelled the strong odor of alcohol on her breath. I realized she wanted to force her way in. At that moment, my insides churned—anger was an emotion I deeply feared. I felt overwhelmed by weakness whenever it arose. My legs went weak, my arms went limp, and even my voice trembled. I realized she didn't respect me at all.\n[2004-11-16 18:01:10] front door | I moved toward her. I said to her seriously, \"You need to talk to me.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:01:15] front door | I heard her refuse: \"No! The letter was written by her. She's the one I want to talk to.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:01:25] front door | I told her, \"Listen, you played music too loud late last night. We couldn't sleep at all. You can't do that. You have to be reasonable.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:01:30] front door | I heard her shout, \"It's none of your business what I do!\"\n[2004-11-16 18:01:40] front door | I said, \"Fine, maybe it's not my business. But we have something called a tenants' agreement, and everyone living here has to follow it.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:01:55] front door | I heard her retort, \"Do you know how much rent I pay? Fifteen thousand kroner! I've lived here eight years, and no one ever said anything before. Then you showed up—little fake prudes. 'Honestly, I'm pregnant.'\"\n[2004-11-16 18:02:10] front door | As she mimicked those last words, I saw her pout her lips, tilt her head up, and thrust her nose into the air. I looked down to avoid her gaze. I watched her turn and walk downstairs. Her unkempt hair and ashen skin came into view. I noticed her cheeks were puffed out, her eyes wide and staring. I could feel her burning gaze fixed on me.\n[2004-11-16 18:02:30] the hallway at home | I closed the door and turned to look at Nils Nils leaning against the wall in the hallway. I said to her, \"This is really, well done.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:02:35] the hallway at home | I heard her retort, \"You're blaming me? She's the one who's gone crazy. What do I have to do with it?\"\n[2004-11-16 18:02:40] the hallway at home | I reassured her, \"Don't get upset, we're not enemies.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:02:45] the hallway at home | I heard Nils Nils say bitterly, \"I'm not putting up with this anymore. I'm calling someone. This can't go on like some damn nightmare.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:02:50] the hallway at home | I explained to her, \"It's not even eleven yet, and it's Friday night. So there's absolutely nothing we can do.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:05:00] at home | I felt Nils Nils watching me. The booming music from the apartment downstairs rang in my ears; I thought it was just as loud and unbearable as the night before.\n[2004-11-16 18:05:10] at home | I heard her ask, \"Shall we go out?\"\n[2004-11-16 18:05:15] at home | I replied, \"I don't think running away is a good idea.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:05:20] at home | I heard her complain, \"But we can't stay here.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:05:25] at home | I responded, \"True enough.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:15:00] Niblu Square / Royal Theatre | After putting on my coat, I watched as we left the house and walked toward Niblu Square. I saw the broken ice slowly piling up at the bow of the approaching ferry. I saw the Royal Theatre standing across the street. Before me lay dazzling lights reflected in the black water. I noticed the stone of the Royal Theatre was extremely pale. I felt the sea wind blowing constantly, and saw the flags flapping by the entrance. I saw that the buildings here shimmered even on a dim, rainy day. I guessed in my mind that the music had stopped perhaps because she herself found it too noisy. I thought about how the Royal Theatre was one of my favorite buildings in Halvik, and I felt it exuded a special character. I marveled at the absence of the usual sense of oppression, and wondered inwardly whether it resembled a small hill by the sea.\n[2004-11-16 18:30:00] Lakeside Road | I walked arm in arm with her along Lakeside Road. I saw darkness covering the waters beyond Ship Island, with scattered lights glowing between houses. I felt as though this place had merged into the natural rhythm of the countryside. In my ears came the howling sounds from the Old Town and Steep Banks across the water, carried through wind and waves.\n[2004-11-16 18:40:00] Lakeside Road | I heard Nils Nils tell me stories about the Royal Theatre. I listened to her analysis of actors’ vanity, anxiety, and scheming. She laughed and told me that the best actors were often the most foolish. I also heard her lavish praise for excellent stage performances. From what I know, she practically grew up in the theatre. I knew her mother raised her and her brother alone, often rehearsing with them. I learned that she actually looked down on actors’ mannerisms and their frivolous emotions.\n[2004-11-16 18:45:00] Lakeside Road | I knew she once worked in the theatre’s cloakroom and had watched 'Peer Gynt' countless times. As far as I knew, she had also worked as a playwright at the City Theatre. I learned she had failed her drama school auditions twice before turning to writing and completing her debut work.\n[2004-11-16 18:50:00] Lakeside Road | I heard her recount her past trip to Tokyo. I heard her describe Mochengdao actors making noise in fine restaurants and stubbing out cigarettes. She laughed and told me that back then she was only fifteen, and must have looked strange in Japanese eyes. She mentioned how the Japanese remained unfazed even when faced with accidents like breaking through paper walls. I knew that trip was during Bergman Company’s touring performance. From what I understood, Nils Nils was then infatuated with someone.\n[2004-11-16 18:50:10] Lakeside Road | I saw her glance toward the Zoo Spring. I heard her say, 'When we were leaving, a waiter came up to me with a bag, saying it was a gift from the chef. When I looked inside, do you know what it was?'\n[2004-11-16 18:50:15] Lakeside Road | I replied, 'I don’t know.'\n[2004-11-16 18:50:20] Lakeside Road | I heard her tell me, 'A full bag of live little crabs.'\n[2004-11-16 18:50:25] Lakeside Road | I asked, 'Crabs? What did that mean?'\n[2004-11-16 18:50:30] Lakeside Road | I saw her shrug her shoulders. I heard her reply, 'I don’t know.'\n[2004-11-16 18:50:35] Binhu Road | I asked, \"How did you handle it?\"\n[2004-11-16 18:50:45] Binhu Road | I heard her describe, \"I brought the crabs back to the hotel and poured them into a bathtub filled with cold water. In the heart of Tokyo, they crawled all night while I slept in the next room.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:50:50] Binhu Road | I pressed further, \"What happened then? What did you do with them?\"\n[2004-11-16 18:51:00] Binhu Road | I saw her look up at me with a gentle smile, feeling her tighten her grip on my hand. I heard her say to me, \"The story ends here.\"\n[2004-11-16 18:52:00] Binhu Road | As far as I knew, she had strong ties to Japan. I knew her poetry collection had won an award, and until recently, there had been a picture of a Japanese person hanging above her desk. Looking at her small, delicate features, I mused inwardly—wasn't there perhaps a faint trace of Japanese character in her appearance too?\n[2004-11-16 19:00:00] Kara Square | I saw us walking toward Kara Square. Before me lay a dry, circular pool, its bottom covered with fallen leaves. I recalled that in summer, a large fountain would appear here.\n[2004-11-16 19:00:10] Kara Square | I asked, \"Do you remember when we went to see 'Ghosts'?\n[2004-11-16 19:00:20] Kara Square | I heard her say, \"Of course! I'll never forget it.\" I knew she had tucked the theater ticket into the photo album she started during her pregnancy. I thought—'Ghosts' was Bergman's last directed play at the Royal Theatre, and one of the earliest things we shared together before our romantic relationship began. Though it only happened a year and a half ago, it felt as if a lifetime had passed.\n[2004-11-16 19:05:00] East Halvik | I met her gaze fixed on me, full of such deep affection it could drown me. I felt the cold—the icy, biting wind. Around us lay the wealthiest part of East Halvik, eerily silent. The streets were always nearly empty, though wider than other parts of the city. This scene made me realize how vast East Halvik was, giving off a slight sense of foreignness, utterly unlike my hometown—yet I couldn't quite pinpoint exactly where the difference lay.",

I heard her say, \"No, the baby's sleeping. It always does when I go for walks.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:07:30] street | I said, \"'The baby'—that really startled me. So often I seem to forget there's an actual person growing inside you.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:07:45] street | I nodded at her. I heard Nils Nils say, \"But it really is—I know it so well, or rather, I feel like I do. Do you remember how angry it got during the diabetes test?\" I knew she was at risk because her father had diabetes. According to her, that sugary mixture was the most disgusting, foul-tasting medicine she'd ever taken, and afterward the baby stirred inside her for over an hour.\n[2004-11-16 19:15:00] Humle Park | I smiled in response, glanced across the street, and walked beside her along the path. I said, \"Must have frightened it.\" Before me lay Humle Park under its dome of lights—some areas thick with large trees, others showing patches of damp yellow grass, and between them, complete darkness. I noticed piles of fallen leaves here and there, no longer resembling the bare floor of a living room. Around the Linnaeus statue, I spotted a jogger, and someone else hurrying down the gentle slope. I felt a captivating atmosphere enveloping the night, but it didn't feel like a forest—it was more like the enchantment of a theater.\n[2004-11-16 19:20:00] Humle Park | I knew beneath my feet stretched the vast book depository of the Royal Library. As far as I knew, just one block away lay Stureplan, where upscale nightclubs gathered and security guards paced back and forth selecting guests as celebrities arrived. I learned that the rural population in Mochengdao was declining, and most significant events were now happening in Halvik. I saw the library standing ahead. I thought, even though we lived just a stone's throw from Stureplan, it felt as if we belonged to another world entirely. I sensed the city's cold side and recalled how different the social distance was back home in Leivik. I marveled at how everything could be so close, yet feel so far away.\n[2004-11-16 19:25:00] Humle Park | I watched her as I asked, saw her shake her head at me. I asked, \"Have you ever wondered where I came from?\" I heard her reply, \"No, not really. You're Grete Lundnes. My handsome husband. That's all I see in you.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:26:00] Humle Park | I said, \"Rocky was a residential neighborhood. It had nothing to do with your world. Do you remember what my mother said the first time she came to our place?\" I thought, I originally knew nothing about life here—everything was completely unfamiliar to me.\n[2004-11-16 19:26:10] Humle Park | I pressed further, \"You don't remember?\"\n[2004-11-16 19:26:20] Humle Park | I began to repeat, \"She said: 'Grandfather should see it too, Grete Lundnes.'\"\n[2004-11-16 19:26:25] Humle Park | I heard Nils Nils say, \"That's nice.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:26:40] Humle Park | I asked her, \"But can you understand it? This apartment isn't special to you. To my mother, it was like a little dance hall.\" Then I added, \"What I mean is, I come from a very different environment. A place that's especially unsophisticated, you know?\" I thought to myself, to me this apartment actually feels like a dance hall too. But the point is, it was a completely different world—and no matter how long I live here, that sense of separation always remains.\n[2004-11-16 19:35:00] Bjørn Jerrys Street | I saw us cross the street, walk down a small residential lane, pass Saturn Café, and finally reach Bjørn Jerrys Street. The West Tower Cinema is located on this street. I felt my face go numb, my thighs cold as ice pillars.\n[2004-11-16 19:35:10] Bjørn Jerrys Street | I heard her say to me, \"You're actually lucky. Think about it—how many advantages it gives you? You always have a place to go. Outward to your hometown, inward to your new home.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:35:15] Bjørn Jerrys Street | I replied, \"I know what you're going to say.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:35:30] Bjørn Jerrys Street | I heard her sigh, \"Everything I have is here. I grew up here. I can't separate myself from it. There were expectations, sure. But nobody expected much of you. At most, they hoped you'd go to school and get a job. Right?\"\n[2004-11-16 19:35:35] Bjørn Jars Street | I shrugged at her. I thought, I've never thought of it that way.\n[2004-11-16 19:35:40] Bjørn Jars Street | I heard her respond, 'Of course you haven't.'\n[2004-11-16 19:36:00] Bjørn Jars Street | I saw her look at me after a brief silence. I heard her continue, 'I’ve always lived here. Mom probably doesn’t expect much from me, as long as I’m not sick or in trouble… so she likes you.'\n[2004-11-16 19:36:05] Bjørn Jars Street | I asked back, 'Is that so?'\n[2004-11-16 19:36:10] Bjørn Jars Street | I heard her say to me, 'Haven’t you noticed? You must have noticed.'\n[2004-11-16 19:36:15] Bjørn Jars Street | I replied, 'Alright, let’s say I did notice.'\n[2004-11-16 19:37:00] Bjørn Jars Street | I recalled the first time we met, in that old farmhouse deep inside the forest. I remembered how it was autumn outside, and as soon as we arrived, we sat down to eat hot meat stew and freshly baked bread. I marveled inwardly at the candles lit on the table, and how I occasionally felt her watching me—her gaze made me feel both curious and warm.\n[2004-11-16 19:38:00] Bjørn Jars Street | I heard Nils Nils go on, 'But where I grew up, besides my mother there were others—' she mentioned Erik Frederik XII—'do you think someone like that, wealthy and cultured, could ever be an ordinary high school teacher?' She told me that in that environment, everyone was expected to excel, and lamented that three of her friends had committed suicide, and many suffered from anorexia—horrors she couldn’t even bear to think about.\n[2004-11-16 19:38:10] Bjørn Jars Street | I heard myself sigh, 'Yeah, that’s really terrible,' then I asked, 'Can’t people just learn to let go?'\n[2004-11-16 19:38:20] Bjørn Jars Street | I heard Nils Nils say firmly, 'I don’t want my children growing up here.'\n[2004-11-16 19:38:25] Bjørn Aar Street | I heard myself ask in slight surprise, \"That's 'the kids' already?\"\n[2004-11-16 19:38:30] Bjørn Aar Street | I saw her break into a smile. I heard her ask, \"How is it?\"\n[2004-11-16 19:38:40] Bjørn Aar Street | I replied, \"Then we'll go there,\" and added, \"I only know of one person who committed suicide there.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:38:45] Bjørn Aar Street | I heard Nils Nils say to me, \"Don't joke about that.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:38:50] Bjørn Aar Street | I conceded, \"Alright.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:40:00] Bjørn Aar Street | I saw a woman in high heels and a long red dress clacking past, carrying a black handbag in one hand. Behind her walked two bearded young men in parkas and hiking boots, followed by three well-dressed women wrapped in trench coats. I noticed a small shivering crowd had gathered outside the entrance of Cinema Sita, while the restaurants along the street glowed with light and were completely full.\n[2004-11-16 19:40:10] Bjørn Aar Street | I heard Nils Nils confess to me, \"But to be honest, it doesn't have to be Rocky. Leivik will definitely do. The people there are friendlier.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:40:15] Bjørn Aar Street | I agreed, \"True.\"",

    "text": "[2004-11-16 19:41:00] Outside Cinema Sita | I reached out and pulled open the heavy door, holding it carefully for her. As I unbuttoned my coat, I said, \"But I don't want to go to Leivik—that's exactly the point.\"\n[2004-11-16 19:41:10] Inside Cinema Sita | I noticed she fell silent, turning her head to look at the posters in the display window. Then I saw her suddenly whirl around toward me. I heard her exclaim excitedly, \"They're showing 'Modern Times'!\"\n[2004-11-16 19:41:15] Xita Cinema interior | I opened my mouth and asked, “Shall we watch it?”\n[2004-11-16 19:41:25] Xita Cinema interior | I heard Nils Nils suggest, “Let’s watch it! But I need to eat something first. What time is it?”\n[2004-11-16 19:41:35] Xita Cinema interior | I began looking around for a clock that showed the time. I told her, “Eight forty.” I saw a small, thick clock on the wall behind the ticket counter.\n[2004-11-16 19:41:45] Xita Cinema interior | I heard Nils Nils say, “It starts at nine. We’ll make it. You go buy the tickets, I’ll check what food they have at the bar.”\n[2004-11-16 19:42:00] Xita Cinema ticket counter | I pulled a crumpled hundred-krone bill from my pocket and walked up to the ticket counter. I said 'Okay' to Nils Nils, then asked the ticket seller, “Do you still have tickets for Modern Times?”\n[2004-11-16 19:42:10] Xita Cinema ticket counter | I heard the girl reply with a certain tone, “Wusai Keda?” Before me stood a very young girl with braids and glasses, and I felt her looking down at me from above.\n[2004-11-16 19:42:20] Xita Cinema ticket counter | I struggled to speak in Mochengdao, word by word: “Do… you… have… tickets… for Modern Times?”\n[2004-11-16 19:42:25] Xita Cinema ticket counter | I heard her answer briefly, “Yes.”\n[2004-11-16 19:42:35] Xita Cinema ticket counter | Just to be safe, I saw myself raise two fingers into the air. I said to her, “Two tickets. Back row, middle. Two.”\n[2004-11-16 19:43:00] Xita Cinema ticket counter | I watched her silently print the tickets and place them on the counter, then saw her smooth out the hundred-krone bill and put it into the cash register.\n[2004-11-16 19:45:00] Xita Cinema Bar | I stepped into the bar and squeezed my way through the crowd until I reached Nils Nils. Before me was the sight of a bar packed tightly with people. I looked around, searching, and finally caught sight of her.\n[2004-11-16 19:45:10] Xita Cinema Bar | I heard myself say to her, 'I love you.' Her surprised voice replied, 'Really?' I realized I almost never say things like that, so when I saw her look up at me, I noticed her eyes lit up.\n[2004-11-16 19:46:00] Xita Cinema Bar | We kissed each other gently. I saw the bartender approach and place a small basket of tortilla chips and a dish resembling guacamole sauce in front of us.\n[2004-11-16 19:46:10] Xita Cinema Bar | I heard Nils Nils ask me, 'Do you want a beer?'\n[2004-11-16 19:46:20] Xita Cinema Bar | I shook my head at her. I said, 'Let's watch the film first. But by then you might be tired.'\n[2004-11-16 19:46:30] Xita Cinema Bar | I heard Nils Nils say, 'Possibly. Did you get the tickets?' I answered, 'Yes, I did.'\n[2004-11-16 21:00:00] Xita Cinema Screening Room | I knew I first watched 'Modern Times' at the age of twenty, at Baysang's film club. I remembered how I couldn't suppress my laughter back then—the uncontrollable shame and wild joy left a vivid impression. I recalled the scene where Chaplin searches for his cufflink; I thought how deeply warm that moment was, and realized it must be because the one who created it was of the same kind as us.\n[2004-11-16 21:05:00] Xita Cinema Screening Room | I saw Chaplin come on stage to greet the audience, one pantomime scene after another unfolding, and then I felt a tear roll down my cheek. Even as I sat down, I was still wondering what awaited us. I realized that something which made me laugh twenty years ago could still make me laugh today. I thought everything about that evening was so wonderful.\n[2004-11-16 22:30:00] Stone Steps outside Finnish Cultural Institute / Cabinet Street | I was still giggling foolishly as we left the cinema, holding Nils Nils's hand while climbing the stone steps. I passed the furniture store and video shop along the roadside, finally unlocking the door and returning home. Seeing it was just past half past ten, we went straight to bed. Before me lay the stone steps beside the Finnish Cultural Institute and the quiet streets of Cabinet Street late at night. I thought my own happiness must have made Nils Nils happy too—she was clearly enjoying it. Recalling scenes from the film, I felt lighthearted and content.\n[2004-11-16 22:40:00] Bedroom at Home | I suddenly sat upright in bed. I heard Nils Nils say, 'Oh God, this can't be real.' I had only lain down for ten minutes when the music downstairs roared up again, so loud that I could no longer hear what she was saying.\n[2004-11-16 22:40:10] bedroom at home | I said, \"It's not even eleven, and it's Friday night. So we're completely helpless.\"\n[2004-11-16 22:40:20] bedroom at home | I saw Nils Nils just getting out of bed and about to leave the room when the music stopped, so we had to go back to bed. I heard Nils Nils say angrily, \"I don't care anymore, I'm calling someone. This damn situation can't go on.\"\n[2004-11-16 23:30:00] bedroom at home | I looked at the clock; it was half past eleven. I heard Nils Nils ask me, \"Are you going to call? I haven't slept at all.\" The same shockingly loud music blared in my ears again, jolting me awake from sleep.\n[2004-11-16 23:35:00] bedroom at home | I noticed that a few minutes later the woman turned off the music. Downstairs fell into complete silence.\n[2004-11-16 23:40:00] living room at home | I heard Nils Nils say, \"I'm sleeping in the living room.\" I realized she played music two more times that night, the last time lasting half an hour. I thought it was absurd and maddening—I felt she was insane and harbored hatred toward us. A sense of foreboding crept over me, as if anything could happen.\n[2004-11-20 14:00:00] Halviken/Apartment | I saw autumn turning into winter, surrounded by baby food, clothes, crying, and vomit. I felt mornings and afternoons becoming wasted and empty, but I realized I couldn’t complain about anything—just shut up and do what I had to do.\n[2004-11-23 10:00:00] stairwell | I saw that we had placed some potted plants on the windowsill outside our apartment door. Two days later, I found the plants were gone. Before me lay the cold, stark stairwell. I knew those flowerpots had been passed down from my great-grandmother, dating back to the years after 1900, among the few household items I’d inherited from my grandmother. I thought that although it was common space, we only wanted to add a bit of brightness. I realized how angry I was about losing the pots, and I suspected someone might be deliberately targeting us.\n[2004-11-23 20:00:00] hallway bulletin board | I saw that we had posted a note on the hallway bulletin board asking about the flowerpots. That evening, I noticed new writing appeared on the note. I saw crude Mochengdao written in blue ink on the note, full of curses and accusations. I read that it questioned whether we were accusing all residents of stealing, and told us to move out.\n[2004-12-01 19:00:00] at home/by the front door | I was assembling a changing table and needed to tap a few hammer strikes. A minute later, I heard a door slam downstairs and saw the Russian woman arrive at our door; I opened it. I saw her cheeks puffed and eyes glaring. I heard her shout at us for making constant banging noises and claim we had woken her up. I tried to explain it was still early, but she accused us of thinking we were superior. Right after my first few hammer taps, wild banging on pipes erupted from downstairs. I realized it was only seven in the evening—I thought it would be fine—but trouble came anyway.",

    "text": "[2004-12-01 10:00:00] at home | Whenever I stepped a little heavily, an extremely sharp, piercing sound of pipe-tapping rang in my ears. I realized she had discovered a new tactic. The noise filled me with inexplicable guilt inside my own room. I hated this sound and felt I couldn’t find peace even in my own home.\n[2004-12-20 18:00:00] Humle Park/Home | I saw that we had bought a Christmas tree from Humle Park, and I hoisted it onto my shoulder to drag it back. Finally, I set it up in the living room. Before me lay snowy streets filled with hurried passersby. I saw a huge Christmas tree standing inside our home. I knew it was just before Christmas. I learned that the tree had cost us eight hundred kroner. I realized that it had seemed quite small when we bought it, but only after bringing it home did I see how enormous it actually was. Looking at this giant Christmas tree, I couldn't help but burst into laughter together with Nils Nils. I thought this might be the last Christmas we'd spend alone together—so buying a bigger tree perhaps wasn't so foolish after all.\n[2004-12-24 20:00:00] Home | I saw that we ate the Christmas dinner brought by Nils Nils's mother, then opened presents. We also watched Chaplin's 'The Circus' together. Afterward, I noticed that we often took walks along empty streets and began preparing the New Year's Eve feast. I learned that Nils Nils's mother had prepared a Mochengdao Christmas dinner for us. I knew we had purchased Chaplin's complete film collection. I realized that during that holiday weekend, the Russian woman had completely slipped our minds—the outside world seemed to cease to exist.\n[2004-12-31 10:00:00] Home | I cleaned the apartment and went out to shop for dinner. I saw myself ironing the white tablecloth, setting the table, and polishing the cutlery and candlesticks. I noticed Anders and Helena arriving first, bringing their daughter. Before me lay the dining room with its neatly laid tablecloth, fruit bowl, and the gleaming dignity of middle-class propriety. I knew Helena was an actress, and Anders was somewhat of a criminal. I learned that Helena was seven years older than Nils Nils.\n[2004-12-31 19:00:00] Apartment Stairwell/Doorway | I opened the door and saw them standing in the stairwell. I saw Helena pushing a stroller and noticed the little girl studying me seriously. I heard Anders say, 'Hey, buddy!' and complain that it was freezing outside. Helena asked me, 'Can we bring the stroller in?' I saw Anders wearing a brown leather hat, and Helena in a white coat and black boots, looking very elegant.\n[2004-12-31 19:00:10] Doorway | I stepped back a few paces to let them in. I said 'Hi' while looking into the little girl's eyes, then said, 'Come on in!' I heard Anders ask, 'Where's Nitulida?' I told him Nils Nils was resting. I heard Anders say, 'Great!'\n[2004-12-31 19:00:20] Doorway | I saw Helena squeeze the stroller through the doorway. I noticed she released the brake, lifted her daughter out, removed the child's hat, and unzipped the snowsuit. I heard Helena ask, 'Do you think it'll fit? Should I open the other door?' I saw the child wearing a dark blue dress and white tights underneath.\n[2004-12-31 19:01:00] Hallway | I saw Anders taking off his coat in the hallway, continuously rubbing his hands together. I heard Anders ask where Nils Nils was; I replied she was resting and confirmed everyone was fine.\n[2004-12-31 19:02:00] Hallway | I saw Helena holding her daughter in her arms. I noticed the child’s elegant outfit for the New Year celebration.\n[2004-12-31 19:03:00] Living Room | I saw Nils Nils walk out from the bedroom, smiling as she hugged Helena. I also saw her lean forward to embrace Anders. I heard Helena exclaim, 'Look how beautiful you are! What a big table! Wow!' I heard Nils Nils reply that it was just an old maternity dress. I noticed they hugged for a long time. I thought only I knew how fleeting her radiance was at this moment.\n[2004-12-31 19:05:00] Kitchen/Doorway | I walked into the kitchen pretending to be busy. Then I heard the doorbell ring and opened the door to see Karl Larsdal and Christina. I heard Karl ask, 'Have you finished cleaning?' I responded with mild surprise, joking that I hadn’t expected them at this hour and worried there wouldn’t be space for them. I felt somewhat surprised seeing Karl—I remembered we had agreed on Monday.\n[2004-12-31 19:06:00] living room at home | I saw Kristina give me a hug. I stepped back to make space for them. Then I noticed Anders’s daughter beginning to crawl around the living room, and things gradually settled down. I heard Kristina say, 'Hi, Grete Lundnes, are you all doing well?' I replied, 'We’re fine.' What caught my eye was the pile of shoes and coats stacked in the hallway.\n[2004-12-31 19:10:00] living room at home | I saw Anders nod toward the Christmas tree in the corner. I smiled at him. I heard Anders tease us about keeping up traditions. I explained, 'It cost us eight hundred kroner—so as long as there's even a hint of green left, it stays right there. We don't just throw money away in this household.' I heard Anders laugh and call me 'boss.' I admit that huge Christmas tree is a bit embarrassing. I thought, Mochengdao people always fail to understand my Leivik jokes.\n[2004-12-31 19:10:10] living room at home | I heard Anders say, 'Here comes the boss with his jokes again!' I responded, 'I'm always joking—only you Mochengdao people never get it. At least you didn’t get it at first.'\n[2004-12-31 19:11:00] living room at home | I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'So you've bought yourselves a nouveau riche Christmas tree, then?' I heard Anders imitate that mixed Leivik accent blending kempe and gutt. I laughed and told them I thought it looked quite small when I bought it. I learned that Mochengdao people usually regard this kind of exaggerated tone as 'New Norwegian,' though it has nothing to do with my actual accent.\n[2004-12-31 19:11:00] living room at home | I explained to them, 'It was an accident. I admit such a big tree is a bit awkward. But I’ve always had problems judging proportions.'\n[2004-12-31 19:11:20] living room at home | I heard Nils Nils ask Anders if he knew what kempe meant. She explained, 'It’s the same as jätte. Jättestor means kempestor.' She also remarked how it took her a whole year to figure out the usage of certain words. I wondered whether Nils Nils thought I’d been offended, so she stepped in to explain.\n[2004-12-31 19:11:30] living room at home | I heard Nils Nils burst into laughter recounting her blunder while translating Setebakken’s book. She said she once mistranslated stue (living room) as stuga, turning the sentence into 'he was in the little hut.' She added, luckily no one had discovered the mistake yet. I learned she had translated that book two years earlier without knowing any Leivik at all.\n[2004-12-31 19:11:40] living room at home | I saw Nils Nils burst into laughter. I heard Anders ask, 'So what do you say for stuga in Leivik?' I told him, 'Hytte.' I heard him exclaim, 'Oh, hytte! Well, of course there’s a difference...' Then I heard Nils Nils say, 'But nobody’s said anything yet.'\n[2004-12-31 19:11:50] living room at home | I heard Anders ask, 'So what do you say for stuga in Leivik?' I told him it was 'Hytte.' He exclaimed, 'Oh, hytte! Well, of course there’s a difference...' I heard Nils Nils laugh loudly and say, 'But nobody’s said anything yet.'\n[2004-12-31 19:15:00] living room at home | I saw Nils Nils stand up to get wine glasses. I watched her untwist the wire securing the cork, noticing how she slightly turned her face away and squinted, bracing herself against the anticipated pop. I asked, 'Would anyone like some champagne?' I heard Nils Nils say, 'I’ll get it.'\n[2004-12-31 19:15:10] living room at home | I saw Nils Nils straighten up and pass around the bubbling champagne to each of us. I noticed she poured herself a glass of soft drink. I heard Anders compliment, 'You're really something.' I heard Nils Nils explain that she had once worked in a restaurant but always struggled with judging how much wine to pour for guests. I heard her propose a toast: 'Cheers, what a pleasure to meet you all!' I heard the cork pop with a sticky, muffled sound, then saw the champagne gush out, accompanied by the hissing of bubbles.",

I heard Karl Larsdal say to me, 'Lobster—can't believe you've adapted so quickly to Mochengdao society.' He marveled that I'd moved here only two years ago and was already making traditional Mochengdao New Year food.\n[2004-12-31 19:20:10] kitchen at home | I cut the first lobster in half and placed it on a plate, then moved on to the next one. I said to Karl, 'I'm not doing this alone.' I heard him laugh and say he knew, then brought up how he and Kristina used to celebrate Mexican Christmas at home; I replied that he'd told me before.\n[2004-12-31 19:30:00] kitchen at home | I noticed Karl Larsdal beginning to talk about his manuscript. I heard Karl talking about his draft, and I occasionally chimed in with an 'Oh, really?' I knew he had spent a year and a half writing the first draft, and I had already read it and written ninety pages of commentary. As far as I knew, the problem with his manuscript was the excessive distance between narrative and event. I realized I was somewhat distracted at that moment. I recalled that my comments were often laced with irony, and I wondered whether I could ever control that ironic impulse. I asked myself inwardly whether this stemmed from some subconscious desire to finally get one over on him.\n[2004-12-31 19:35:00] kitchen at home | I laid the third lobster on its back and cut open the shell at the belly. I saw the red flesh and the white cartilage wrapped inside. I said, 'I am praying, asking for your forgiveness.' I caught a faint smell of seawater. I felt the shell was softer than crab shell, with a slightly sticky texture. Looking at the lobster, I thought its vivid red color and delicate claw structure made it seem like an artifact forged in a Renaissance artisan's workshop. I wondered what it might feel like to walk along the seabed.\n[2004-12-31 19:35:10] kitchen at home | I saw Karl Larsdal’s knife and fork hovering above his plate. I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'You should indeed—say ten Hail Marys for your fallen, sinful soul.' He sighed to me that enduring my mocking comments every day was no easy thing, joking, '“Are you a complete idiot or what?” Yeah, I guess I am...'\n[2004-12-31 19:35:20] kitchen at home | As I sawed back and forth at the shell with my knife, I stole a glance at him. I said to Karl, 'It’s just a technical issue.'\n[2004-12-31 19:35:35] kitchen at home | I heard Karl say, 'Technical? Technical? That’s easy for you to say.' He remarked that being able to write twenty pages about a trip to the toilet and still keep readers hooked was a special talent. I heard him say others wrote poems with only three words per page because they had no choice, while I could do it yet looked down on them for it.\n[2004-12-31 19:36:00] kitchen at home | I heard Karl continue, \"You say you don't see letters when you write, right? All I see are those damn letters.\" He complained to me that the letters entangle like spiderwebs, making everything feel as painful as toenails growing into flesh. I looked at the white lobster meat and the red fibers revealed when the shell cracked, and smelled the scent of seawater.\n[2004-12-31 19:36:10] kitchen at home | I asked Karl, 'How long have you been writing? A year? That’s nothing.' I told him I’d written for six years and produced only one hundred thirty pages of prose about angels. I joked that the section was actually quite good—just needed careful fact-checking of interviews. I knew I had written for six years and completed only a little over a hundred pages. I knew he had been writing for a year. I thought this might be the only area where I could still hold an advantage over him.\n[2004-12-31 19:36:20] kitchen at home | I placed the halved lobster onto a plate, shell side up. I picked up the last lobster and began to cut it. I said to Karl, \"You know, this is actually the only place where I can really hold you.\"\n[2004-12-31 19:36:30] kitchen at home | I saw Karl Larsdal burst into laughter. I heard Karl retort, \"No way? There are at least one or two of my weaknesses you know about—please don't let anyone else find out.\" I replied, \"Oh, that? That's completely different.\" I heard his loud, heartfelt laughter.\n[2004-12-31 19:37:00] kitchen at home | I started cutting the lobster with the knife. I noticed he didn't say a word for the next few seconds, and I couldn't help wondering if he was sulking. I thought some things could never be spoken aloud; if I had truly hurt his feelings, I would probably never know. I realized he was both proud and loyal, and perhaps it was precisely because he refused to compromise that he had lost many friends.\n[2005-01-02 10:00:00] Halvik/apartment | I knew the small harassments in the apartment building were still ongoing. As far as I knew, our experience on New Year's Eve hadn't changed the Russian neighbor's attitude toward us.\n[2005-01-02 10:05:00] Halvik/apartment | I realized any idea that she would stop tormenting us was too naive. I found that her provocations were even increasing in frequency.\n[2005-01-15 02:00:00] Halvik writing room | I went to the new writing room on Dala Street every day. I saw Nils Nils come to visit me during lunch, bringing Vanja. I moved into the writing room and wrote day and night. I sat smoking on a bench outside the hospital. I felt a strange sensation of fire burning inside me—calm, clear, and bright. I saw the quiet streets at night. I knew the material I was writing was evolving from essays into a novel. I realized I had reached two heights in fiction that exceeded all expectations, giving value to my five years of previous failed efforts. I marveled inwardly at how this intense happiness made it impossible for me to sit still. I thought everything had suddenly become meaningful.\n[2005-01-15 03:00:00] Halvik writing room | I realized those two moments of inspiration were arguably the two best moments of my entire life. I felt they gave me a complete, whole-body happiness—a feeling I had always searched for but never found before.\n[2005-01-15 08:30:00] Halvik/apartment | I heard the sound of pipes being banged near my ear. I realized that whenever we made the slightest noise—turning on the radio or dropping a book—the protest sounds would immediately follow. I noticed even if I stepped a little heavier on the floor, she would react.\n[2005-01-25 15:00:00] apartment laundry room | I saw someone had placed my laundry bag, which I'd accidentally left in the laundry room, underneath the sink and deliberately loosened the drainpipe. I found the bag filled with dirty water flowing from the sink. I knew the IKEA bag contained clean clothes.\n[2005-02-10 09:00:00] Halvik/apartment | I saw Nils Nils receive a phone call. I heard the property management company on the other end say they had received a serious complaint letter about us. I heard them asking us to take time to explain ourselves. I knew it was the company that owned the building. I realized winter was coming to an end.\n[2005-02-10 09:05:00] Halvik/Apartment | I knew the complaint letter listed five charges: first, playing loud music at inappropriate times; second, leaving garbage bags outside the door; third, placing the baby stroller at the entrance; fourth, tossing cigarette butts in the backyard; fifth, using the laundry room outside of assigned hours and failing to clean up afterward.\n[2005-02-10 09:10:00] Halvik/Apartment | I learned that besides the neighbor, her girlfriend who lived upstairs had also signed the complaint letter. I asked myself inwardly, what could we possibly say? If we claimed the neighbor was picking on us, it would sound like we were speaking ill of her. I realized this situation was extremely delicate.\n[2005-02-10 09:15:00] Halvik/Apartment | I knew those two neighbors had taken photos of the garbage bags left by our door. I realized some complaints were indeed valid—like putting out trash at night. I thought to myself that since everyone else did it, we followed suit, and there was no denying that part.\n[2005-02-10 09:20:00] Halvik/Apartment | I felt indignant, thinking: do they expect us to carry the baby stroller and heavy items up and down several times a day? I realized I might have misremembered the laundry schedule, but still, if everyone does it, why single us out?\n[2005-02-10 09:25:00] Halvik/Apartment | I heard the other side warn that if there were more complaints, our rental contract would be reassessed. As far as I knew, they decided to let this complaint go this time, but issued a warning.\n[2005-02-10 09:30:00] Halvik | I knew in Mochengdao, rental agreements were lifelong and extremely valuable. I understood that getting such a home in the city center either required half a lifetime of waiting or buying it illegally on the black market for millions of kroner.",

    "text": "[2005-02-10 09:35:00] Halvik/Apartment | I knew in Mochengdao, failing to pay bills on time could result in being denied loans or mobile phone services. I learned that years later, when I needed a loan, I was indeed flatly rejected. I realized this rental agreement was our only valuable asset, and we had to strictly follow the rules to keep it. I mocked myself—being someone who didn’t understand caution, I only grasped how serious the consequences were much later, while people from Mochengdao always managed things perfectly and looked down on people like me.\n[2005-02-10 09:40:00] Mochengdao | I heard Nils Nils say she wanted peace and quiet, and believed she had every right to it. I sighed inwardly. Though I knew she indeed had that right, I couldn’t understand why it became an excuse to treat guests poorly. I thought to myself that hospitality mattered greatly to me, and seeing her deliberately give Henrik Inge the cold shoulder, I didn’t understand why she had to stir up trouble—I felt one’s temperament should be better controlled.\n[2005-02-10 09:45:00] Halvik | I said nothing, swallowed my reproach, and suppressed my anger. After I saw Henrik Inge and the children leave, I noticed Nils Nils became cheerful again. I realized I hadn’t punished her with coldness, but instead let the absurdities drift away like wind—and that Christmas afterward, we had a truly joyful celebration.\n[2005-02-10 09:50:00] Mochengdao | On the last night of 2003, I saw myself rushing back and forth in the kitchen preparing food, and I noticed Karl Larsdal sitting in a chair watching me. Karl Larsdal’s endless chatter echoed in my ears. I knew all traces of my life in Baysang had completely vanished; everything around me now was tied to these two people. I realized how deeply influenced I was by Karl. This trait of being easily influenced made me uncomfortable, and I silently reminded myself: keep your distance from him, don’t pick up his bad habits.\n[2005-02-10 09:55:00] Mochengdao/Laundry Room | I saw myself plating the last half lobster, putting down the knife, and wiping sweat from my forehead. I saw myself cutting lemons and placing them in the center of the lobster, then sprinkling parsley over it. I said, \"Done—just the side dishes left.\" I heard Karl Larsdal ask someone if they knew what I did for a living, saying a writer’s life should be exciting, yet here I was washing dishes and cooking. I replied, \"True enough—but look how nice this is!\"\n[2005-02-10 10:00:00] Mochengdao | I heard Karl Larsdal laugh loudly, saying people liked wild writers, not recluses like Bergson who stayed indoors and eventually killed himself. His infectious laughter rang in my ears, and I started laughing along with him.\n[2005-02-10 10:10:00] Mochengdao | I heard Karl Larsdal laugh again, calling Ibsen boring, though he respected the fact that Ibsen kept scorpions on his table. He told me that if Leivik Literature were to categorize me, I wouldn’t come out well. I said to him, \"Well then, so be it—this place is at least clean. Anyway, only the bread remains now.\"\n[2005-02-13 10:15:00] Lim Port Stadium | I saw myself taking bread from a brown paper bag, rinsing the knife under water, and beginning to slice it. I heard Karl Larsdal tell me I should quickly write that article about Astridvik I’d been talking about. I told him I would write it someday, mentioning that man’s mad antics—destroying furniture and lying naked in the coal cellar—and sighed that he must have been insane for years.\n[2005-02-13 10:20:00] Lim Port Stadium | I heard Karl Larsdal remind me not to forget that the man once wrote Hitler was a great man. I agreed, and told him the most meaningful parts of the diary were those written during his episodes—when inhibitions vanished and he expressed his true thoughts about other writers. That shift was strikingly intense.\n[2005-02-13 10:45:00] Lim Port Stadium | I saw myself placing slices of bread into a small basket and starting to cut another loaf. I heard Karl Larsdal sigh that no one dared write such things. I countered that there was a reason—tolerance, politeness, consideration. Hearing him sound bored, I told him seriously that without understanding this, one could never understand Hauge.\n[2005-02-13 11:30:00] Lim Port Stadium | I heard Karl Larsdal ask whether I thought Hauge was a great poet. I affirmed that I did. I heard him press further—should we, out of tolerance, ignore the mad aspects of a great poet’s life? I asked him in return: if we know he was insane during certain cycles, where does wisdom come in? Where exactly lies the boundary?\n[2005-02-13 12:00:00] Hospital Emergency Room | I heard Karl Larsdal mock me for being soft-headed, saying all the odd stories about Hauge were ones I’d told him. He believed wisdom couldn’t be understood apart from a tragic life. I said to him, \"As the Chinese say, there’s no smoke without fire.\" I felt a twinge of guilt over having mocked Bergson earlier.\n[2005-02-13 12:30:00] Hospital Emergency Room | I finished slicing the last few pieces of bread and saw myself laughing along with the others. I placed the bread into the basket. I heard Karl Larsdal laugh and call me too sensitive. I said to him, \"Grab the bread basket, butter, and mayonnaise—we’ll go join the others now.\" I realized I actually felt somewhat uneasy inside.\n[2005-02-13 12:35:00] Hospital Examination Room | I saw myself placing the dishes on the table, pouring out the remaining champagne and opening a bottle of white wine. I noticed myself sitting down, putting half a lobster onto my plate, and cracking open the large claw with a nutcracker. I heard Helena exclaim how wonderful it was, and Nils Nils complimented me on doing a great job. I said, \"Everyone, please dig in.\" I felt the thick, delicious texture of the shrimp meat, and wondered in my mind what it had been like for this lobster as it wandered across the seabed.\n[2005-02-13 12:40:00] hospital examination room | I saw myself raise my wine glass, and everyone else raised their glasses as well. In the Leivik dialect, I loudly proclaimed, \"What a gathering, everyone!\" Then I shouted, \"Cheers!\" I heard Anders respond, \"Cheers! Thank you for inviting us!\" I noticed Karl Larsdal had a smile on his face.\n[2005-02-13 13:00:00] hospital X-ray room | I inwardly mused that whenever I have guests, I usually end up cooking—not because I'm diligent, but because it gives me an excuse to hide in the kitchen. Even when I do appear, I can mask myself by refilling drinks; as soon as the appetizers are finished, I immediately want to clear the table and prepare the next course.\n[2005-02-13 14:00:00] hospital | I mentally analyzed tonight's social dynamics: I couldn't truly talk with Anders or Helene; there seemed to be a tense resistance between Nils Nils and Karl Larsdal; I sensed Helene was always dissatisfied with Anders, and Kristina remained silent for long stretches—these emotions left me feeling torn.\n[2005-02-13 15:00:00] hallway at home | I saw myself scoop out thick, slippery meat from its shell, divide it, and spear a large bite, dipping it in mayonnaise before bringing it to my mouth. I heard everyone begin to talk, though I didn't quite follow; the conversation started haltingly. I heard a loud boom from outside, like an explosion. I saw the windowpanes rattling violently. I sensed underlying currents of sympathy and aversion beneath the surface, yet this evening felt special—as if everyone were willing to share any story from their lives.\n[2005-02-13 15:05:00] hallway at home | I heard Anders say these fireworks weren't legal. Karl Larsdal joked that he was an expert in such matters. Helene mentioned the Chinese balloons they'd bought would silently float skyward once lit. I heard Nils Nils worry about what if the balloon landed on the roof, while Anders said anything could happen on New Year's Eve.\n[2005-02-13 15:10:00] living room at home | I got up to pour drinks for everyone. I saw myself meet Helene’s smiling gaze, then sat down and looked toward Karl Larsdal. During this silence, I hesitated over whether to tell them about the time I collected gunpowder on New Year’s and nearly got caught by my father. But then I thought better of it, deciding the story wasn’t interesting enough, and let the idea go.\n[2005-02-13 15:15:00] living room at home | I heard Anders ask, \"But why compare Mochengdao and Leivik at all?\" He complained that things here were lifeless. I heard Helene say Anders wanted to return to Spain, while Anders asked everyone what could possibly keep anyone here. Nils Nils chimed in, asking what Spain was like.\n[2005-02-13 15:30:00] kitchen at home | I saw Anders spread his arms wide. I heard Anders say that in Spain, no one bothers you, it's warm, and there are enchanting cities like Seville. He looked at me and suggested we go together to see a Real Madrid versus Barcelona match. I replied, \"Sounds good.\" He called out to me, \"Let's go! Buddy!\"\n[2005-02-13 15:45:00] kitchen at home | I saw Nils Nils smile at me. I realized her smile expressed happiness for me, yet deep in her eyes lingered anxiety and a calculated desire to control everything. I sensed this silence rooted in slight unease, like a root growing downward—even though I knew this thought might be foolish.\n[2005-02-13 15:50:00] kitchen at home | I saw myself lean over to refill Anders’ glass. I saw myself pour a full glass for myself and pick meat from a crab claw. I noticed Anders and Karl Larsdal burst into laughter. I asked about the football match schedule. I heard Anders say he didn’t know, but he just wanted to see Barcelona. He mentioned waiting until after the baby is born for a week before leaving. I heard their joking voices calling themselves \"men of the fifties,\" even teasing that they’d pace the hallway like old men.",

    "text": "[2005-02-13 16:00:00] living room at home | I saw everyone nodding in thanks for the meal, so I gathered up the plates and took them into the kitchen. I saw Kristina following me in with a large shallow dish. I asked, 'Has everyone finished eating?' I saw Kristina ask if she could help, and I said to her quietly, 'No, thank you for being so thoughtful.'\n[2005-02-13 17:00:00] living room at home | I placed two cast-iron pots on the electric stove, turning the heat to maximum. I saw myself open the window, then walk back into the living room and put on a CD. I stood behind Nils Nils, placing my hands on her shoulders. I heard Anders say he would never ask me if I needed help. I heard Helene ask whether she could help, and I replied, 'No, no, it's fine.' Nils Nils said to me, 'That's nice.' Outside the window, I heard the sound of fireworks exploding. After opening the window, I immediately heard the voices of pedestrians downstairs become much louder.\n[2005-02-13 19:00:00] bathroom at home | In the silence, I heard Nils Nils tell a story she had heard at the Film Building: someone kept a red-tailed boa as a pet, and when the giant snake stretched out straight on the bed, it was actually measuring its prey, preparing to swallow a person whole.\n[2005-02-13 19:10:00] bathroom at home | I saw everyone burst into laughter. I noticed Nils Nils turn to look at me. I saw myself turn around and go back to the kitchen. I heard myself exclaim, 'Oh God!' I heard Nils Nils tell everyone I was afraid of snakes, describing how I dreamed about snakes stomping on my bed at night and woke up jumping. I heard her mimic my dismissive tone saying, 'You talk about bugs like they're not dangerous at all!' I heard Karl Larsdal explain the difference between 'bugs' and 'snakes' to Anders and his wife. I thought this was the most disgusting story I'd ever heard. I realized the next thing would be some Freudian interpretation, which I didn't want to hear, so I went back to the kitchen.\n[2005-02-13 19:20:00] bathroom at home | I saw the water come to a boil, so I added the pasta. I put chopped garlic into the hot pan, fished mussels out of the sink and tossed them into the pot, then covered it with a lid. A little later, I poured in white wine and sprinkled parsley. Finally, I saw myself removing the mussels and pouring the pasta into a colander. I heard the oil sizzling and popping in the two hot pans.\n[2005-02-13 19:45:00] bathroom at home | I carried the plate into the room. I noticed everyone looking at me. I lowered my head, picked up a mussel, used my fork to dig out the dark brown soft meat inside, and took a bite. I heard Helene exclaim, 'Oh, how beautiful.' I replied, 'It's actually quite simple—I found the recipe in Jamie Oliver's cookbook.' I heard Kristina say it smelled delicious. I heard Anders stare at me and ask, 'Is there anything you can't do?' I heard the crunching sound when biting into the mussel, like grinding sand with my teeth.\n[2005-02-13 20:00:00] bathroom at home | I looked up at Anders. I asked Anders if Nils Nils had told them about our salted lamb rib dinner. I heard myself explain to everyone that it was a traditional Christmas dish from Leivik, cured and sent to me by my mother. I told them about the year the meat arrived late, how Nils Nils and I worked through the night only to end up with nothing but the smell of lamb filling the apartment, and finally just went to sleep. I learned that salted lamb ribs are a traditional Christmas dish in Leivik, and I knew they were salt-cured lamb ribs hung to dry for months. I thought to myself, celebrating Christmas without salted lamb ribs was completely unimaginable to me.\n[2005-02-13 20:05:00] bathroom at home | I saw Nils Nils smiling mischievously at me. I heard Nils Nils say, 'So he woke me up at one o'clock! Then we sat here, just the two of us, eating Leivik Christmas meat in the middle of the night.' I asked her, 'Wasn't that nice?' She smiled at me and said, 'Yes, it was pretty good.' I heard Helene ask, 'But was it really good?' and Nils Nils answered, 'Good. Maybe it doesn't look like much, but it really is good.' I heard Anders say to me, 'I thought you were going to tell us a story about something you couldn't do, but this is pure pastoral idyll.'\n[2005-02-13 20:10:00] bathroom at home | I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'Give him a break. His whole act is telling people how much of a failure he is—misfortune after misfortune, nothing but shame and regret from beginning to end. It's a party! Let him try something different for once—tell us how talented he is!' I heard Helene say to Anders, 'I want to hear about your setbacks, Anders.' I heard Anders reply, 'Don't forget who you're talking to! You're speaking to a former rich man. I'm telling you, genuinely rich. I once owned two cars, an apartment in Östermalm, a bank account full of money. I could go on vacation anywhere I wanted, whenever I pleased. I even had several horses! And what am I doing now? Surviving on a ham snack factory in Dalarna! But I'm not sitting idle like you lot, complaining nonstop!'\n[2005-02-15 10:00:00] Harvik's home | I heard Helene ask, 'Who are you people?' Anders replied, 'Like you and Nils Nils! I come home and find you sitting on the sofa with tea cups, complaining about everything. All possible and impossible feelings—you insist on battling them endlessly. It's not complicated. Things either go well or they don't. But that's fine too, because when they don't go well, they only get better.' I heard Helene say, 'Your problem is strange—you don't even want to know where you are, but it's not a lack of self-awareness; it's that you simply don't want to figure it out. Sometimes I envy you. Really. I struggle so hard to understand who I am and why the things that happen to me happen the way they do.'\n[2005-02-15 19:30:00] apartment stairwell | I saw her smile, glancing left and right. I heard Karl Larsdal ask, 'Your story isn't all that different from Anders's, is it?' Helena countered, 'What do you mean?' Karl continued, 'Well, you had it all. You worked at the Royal Theatre, starred in many major films—excellent movie roles—and then you gave it all up and just walked away. I'd say that was an awfully optimistic move. Married a New Age leader from America, went to Hawaii.' I heard Helena say, 'Not such a great career move, no. You're right about that. But I followed my feelings. I have nothing to regret. Nothing, truly nothing!'\n[2005-02-15 19:31:00] apartment stairwell | I saw Anders looking at Kristina, who laughed, lifted her head proudly, and swallowed her food. I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'Kristina has a similar story.' I heard Anders say to Kristina, 'Then tell us your story.' I heard Kristina say, 'I had almost reached the peak before I even really started. I had my own fashion brand, was named Designer of the Year once. I was chosen to represent Mochengdao at the Shannest Fashion Show. I held exhibitions in Paris...'\n[2005-02-15 19:32:00] bicycle storage room | I saw Kristina shrug her shoulders. I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'A TV crew came to our house, with a huge banner—no, a massive sail—hanging on the front of the Cultural Palace, bearing Kristina’s face. The Daily News did a six-page feature on her… We attended parties where waitresses were dressed as fairies. Champagne everywhere. We were fucking happy.' I heard Nils Nils ask, 'So what happened then?' Kristina replied, 'Couldn’t make money. No foundation for success. Or rather, I ended up somewhere I shouldn’t have. So I went bankrupt.'",

Kristina responded, 'That’s true.' I heard Karl continue, 'The final exhibition was the last nail in the coffin. Kristina rented a gigantic tent and set it up in Ladigode Park. The tent was a replica of the Sydney Opera House. The models were supposed to ride horses across the open field when they appeared. The horses were borrowed from the Mochengdao Guards and mounted police. Everything was spectacular, and very expensive. She spared no cost. Giant goblets filled with burning ice—you know, smoke swirling around—everyone showed up. All the TV stations, all the major newspapers. It was like a scene from a blockbuster movie. Then it started raining. I mean real rain. A downpour, pouring buckets.'\n[2005-02-15 19:35:00] apartment doorway/foyer | I heard a burst of loud laughter. I saw Karl Larsdal looking at me. I heard Karl Larsdal continue, 'You should’ve seen the models! The male models’ hair was plastered to their heads. All the models’ clothes were soaked, everyone looked disheveled. It was a complete and utter disaster. But there was also a dignified side: not everyone can fail so gloriously.' He said to me, 'That’s why when you first came to our place, she was designing slippers.' I heard Kristina protest, 'Those weren’t slippers.' Karl replied, 'Same thing. They had an old pair of shoes that suddenly became popular because Kristina wore them at the Shannest Fashion Show. But she got nothing from it. So this design project is a small compensation. Look at what remains of those dreams—this is all that’s left.'\n[2005-02-15 19:35:05] apartment foyer | I heard Nils Nils say, 'Strictly speaking, I never experienced a peak in life—only minor successes, strictly following the same downward curve.' I heard Anders ask, 'Downhill all the way?' She replied, 'Downhill, yes. I published my debut work, which of course was a wonderful thing in itself—not necessarily stunning to others, but a big deal for me, something truly marvelous. Then I even won a prize in Japan, totally unexpected. I’ve always loved Japan. I was supposed to go there to accept it. I bought a phrasebook for basic Japanese and all that. Then I fell ill. Suddenly couldn’t handle anything. Going to Japan was out of the question… Later I wrote a series of poems; they accepted them at first. After learning that, I went out to celebrate—but then they rejected them again. I took the manuscript to another publisher, and it was exactly the same. At first, the editor called me, saying the writing was excellent, that they’d publish it. It was so embarrassing—I told everyone about it… Then he called back, saying they’d ultimately decided not to publish after all. That’s how it went.'\n[2005-02-15 19:35:10] apartment living room | I saw Karl Larsdal burst into laughter. I heard Anders say, 'That’s really sad.' Nils Nils replied, 'Oh, it’s fine. I’m actually glad now that it wasn’t published. It’s no big deal.' I heard Helena ask, 'What about you, Karl Larsdal?' Karl countered, 'Are you asking if I’m also a graceful failure?' Helena said yes. I heard Karl say, 'Well, I suppose I am too. I used to be an academic prodigy.' I interjected, 'Even though you’re saying it yourself?' He replied, 'Others wouldn’t say it. But I really was. I wrote a thesis based on fieldwork in Mochengdao, in Leivik language. That was the wrong move. It meant publishers in Mochengdao weren’t interested, nor were any Leivik-language publishers. It didn’t help that I wrote about boxers either… In the end, I had to self-publish. Nobody read it… One day I spoke with a woman from the publishing house, and she told me she reads my book every morning and evening on the ferry between Nesodden and Bærum. She thinks someone must’ve seen the cover and gotten curious!'\n[2005-02-15 19:35:15] apartment foyer | I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'Since I’m no longer teaching, I don’t write any academic articles anymore, and I don’t attend academic conferences—I’m busy writing my own book, which will take five years to finish, and I think nobody will want to read it.' I heard Anders say to him, 'You should’ve told me earlier; at least I could’ve gotten you on TV. You could’ve talked about your book on television.' I heard Helena ask, 'How would you respond if you actually faced an offer you couldn’t refuse?' Karl replied, 'Thank you for the offer, even though you don’t actually have the connections to get me on TV.'\n[2005-02-15 19:35:30] apartment foyer | I saw Anders looking at me. Anders said to me, 'Now it’s just you left.' I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'Grete Lundnes? He doesn’t know how lucky he is. I’ve been saying that ever since he arrived in Halvik.' I objected, 'I don’t see it that way.' I told them, 'It’s been nearly five years since I published my debut. It’s true that journalists still call me every now and then. But what do they ask? “Hey, Grete Lundnes, I’m writing an article about writers with writer’s block—could we talk?” And worse: “Listen, we’re doing a feature on authors who’ve only written one book. There are quite a few of those, you know. And well, you’ve only written one book. I wonder if you have time to talk about it—your thoughts, you know. Are you still writing? Feeling a bit dried up?”'\n[2005-02-15 19:35:45] apartment living room | I saw Karl Larsdal look at me and burst into loud laughter. I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'Did you hear that? He doesn’t know how lucky he is.' I protested to him, 'But I’ve achieved nothing! These past four years I’ve been writing constantly, and still achieved nothing! Nothing at all!' I heard Karl continue, 'All my friends have failed. Not ordinary, mainstream failures—these are actually quite extraordinary. One of them posted an online dating ad saying he loves forests and fields, enjoys roasting sausages over campfires, and so on—only because he can’t afford to take anyone out to dinner or treat them to cafés. He’s completely broke. Absolutely destitute! Another university colleague became obsessed with a prostitute, spent all his money on her—over two hundred thousand kroner—and even paid for breast augmentation surgery to make her match his ideal. Another friend started a vineyard. In Uppsala! Yet another has been working on his doctoral thesis for fourteen years. He can never finish because new theories or books keep appearing that he hasn’t read yet but feels he must include. He keeps writing and writing—he’s intellectually sound, but stuck in a dead end. And a friend from Aucity got a thirteen-year-old girl pregnant.'\n[2005-02-15 19:36:00] apartment living room | I saw Nils Nils sitting there, clutching her stomach with both hands. Our eyes met, and I smiled at her. I heard Karl Larsdal continue, 'Don't worry, it's not Grete Lundnes. At least not the one I know. And my painter friend—he has skill, talent—but all he paints are Viking ships and swords, gone too far now to turn back, of course he can't get in either. I mean, for an art career, pirate ships aren't exactly a golden ticket.' I heard Anders say, 'Don’t drag me into this group.' Karl replied, 'No, none of you here are in it—yet. I have a feeling we're all already sliding downhill. We’re sitting on a broken boat. Yes, right now it’s fine—the sky is dark, full of stars, the water isn’t cold—but we’ve already begun to slide.' I heard Nils Nils comment, 'Very poetic.' Then she whispered, 'But that’s not how I feel right now.' I silently marveled: I’m going to be a father—there’ll be a child in the house in just two weeks. I read her gaze; she was telling me she was happy.\n[2005-02-15 19:36:10] apartment living room | I saw the table grow quiet. I noticed everyone leaning back in their chairs. I picked up the bottle and stood to refill everyone’s glasses. I set the bottle down and used my thumb to stop the wine dripping from the neck. I heard Helena say, 'We’re always so honest. I was thinking—this has never happened before.' I said to the group, 'It’s a competition. Who’s the worst off? Me!' I heard Karl Larsdal shout, 'No! It’s me!'\n[2005-02-15 19:36:15] apartment living room | I saw her make a grimace. I heard Helena say, 'I find it hard to imagine my parents sitting like this, talking about these things with friends. They really did build everything from nothing. We’re different.' I heard Kristina ask, 'How so?' Helena answered, 'My father was the wig king of Örebro. He made wigs. His first wife—my mother—was an alcoholic. She was terribly unpleasant; I couldn’t visit her. One visit would take weeks to recover from. But when Dad remarried, he picked another alcoholic.' I recalled seeing the woman once at a child’s baptism at Helena’s home—she had been in that strange state between complete self-control and total collapse. I remembered how often Helena mocked her; that grimace just now perfectly captured her stepmother’s essence.\n[2005-02-15 19:36:20] apartment living room | I heard everyone burst into laughter. I heard Helena laugh, 'When I was little, they’d inject alcohol into those small juice cartons. That way they looked completely innocent. Hahaha! Once I went on vacation alone with my mom—she gave me a sleeping pill, locked the door from outside, and went into town.' She continued, 'But now she’s worse. She’s become a witch. If we go see her, she’ll devour us. She only thinks of herself, doesn’t care if others live or die. Drinks all day, constantly drunk.' I saw her look at me and ask, 'Your dad drinks too, right?'\n[2005-02-15 19:36:25] apartment living room | I saw everyone laughing, and I laughed along. I replied, 'Yes, he did drink. He didn’t drink when I was young. He started when I was sixteen. He died when I was thirty. So he drank for fourteen years. He died from drinking. I think maybe that was what he was aiming for all along.' I heard Anders ask, 'Don’t you have any funnier stories about him?' Helena came to my rescue: 'I don’t think Grete Lundnes enjoys her own misfortune as much as you enjoy other people’s pain.' I told them, 'No, no, it’s okay—I’m numb to it now. I don’t know if the next one counts as funny, but listen: In the end, he lived with my grandmother. Of course, he kept drinking. One day he fell down the stairs and landed in the living room. I think he broke a leg, or maybe it was a serious sprain. Either way, he couldn’t move, so he just lay there on the floor. My grandmother wanted to call an ambulance, but he refused. So he stayed there, lying on the living room floor, being fed and served drinks by my grandmother—eating, drinking. I don’t know how long it lasted. Maybe several days. My uncle found him. He was still lying there.' I recalled my father lying on the floor at my grandmother’s, refusing an ambulance, and the image of my uncle finding him still there.\n[2005-02-15 19:36:30] apartment living room | I heard Anders ask, 'What was he like when he wasn’t drinking? The first sixteen years?' I told him, 'He was a bastard. I was terrified of him—literally scared shitless. I remember once… well, I loved swimming as a kid. In winter, I’d go to the pool—that was the best part of every week. Once I lost a sock there. Couldn’t find it. I searched and searched, but it was nowhere. I was absolutely terrified. A complete nightmare.' I heard Helena ask, 'Why?' I replied, 'Because if he found out, it would’ve been unbearable.' Helena exclaimed, 'Just because you lost a sock?' I said, 'Exactly. Of course, the chance of him finding out was tiny—I could sneak in quietly and quickly put on another pair. But I was still afraid walking home. I opened the door—no one there—and started taking off my shoes. Someone came in—who else but my dad? What did he do? Just stood there, watching me take off my shoes.' Helena pressed, 'Then what?' I said bitterly, 'He slapped me and told me I’d never go to the pool again.' I heard Karl Larsdal laugh loudly: 'Finally someone who thinks like me! After all, it’s the same!' I recalled the childhood fear of my father—the feeling of utter dread that still felt vivid today.\n[2005-02-15 19:37:00] apartment living room | I heard Helena ask, 'Did your dad beat you?' Karl Larsdal hesitated and said, 'The Leivik parenting tradition had its quirks. You know—bend over, pull down your pants—but he never hit my face, never struck me out of the blue like Grete Lundnes’s dad. It was just punishment, nothing more. I thought it was fair, but he didn’t like doing it. I think he saw beating children as a duty—one he had to fulfill. He was very kind, my father. A good man. I hold no grudge against him—even for hitting me. It was a culture very different from ours today.'\n[2005-02-15 19:37:05] apartment living room | I saw Anders smile. Then I saw him imitate an old woman’s raspy voice. I heard Anders say, 'I can’t say my father was like that. Well, I don’t want to revisit childhood or dig through psychological junk. When I was young, we were rich—I’ve mentioned that. After school, I joined his company, became some kind of partner. I lived a wonderful upper-class life. Then suddenly he collapsed. Turns out he’d been cooking the books, committing fraud. And I’d signed everything he handed me. I got out of prison, but now I owe the tax office a massive debt—meaning every penny I earn for the rest of my life goes toward paying it back. So now I have no job. Nothing I do matters—they’ll take it all.' I asked, 'What happened to your father?' He replied, 'He ran away. I’ve never seen him since. Don’t know where he is—somewhere abroad. And I don’t want to see him.' I heard Nils Nils say, 'But your mother is still here.' Anders responded, 'You’re right—yes, suffering, abandoned, penniless.' I said to him, 'I’ve seen her once—no, twice. She’s quite interesting. Sitting on a stool in the corner, talking to anyone who’ll listen, sarcastic, full of humor.' I heard Anders retort, 'Humor?' Then he began to imitate her. I recalled Anders’s mother, remembering how she sat in the corner, mocking people with sharp wit.\n[2005-02-15 19:37:10] apartment living room | I heard Karl Larsdal say, 'My mother was always afraid—this poisoned everything in her life, or at least cast a shadow over it. She wanted everyone around her all the time. My childhood was pure hell; I fought desperately to escape. Her way of holding on to me was making me feel guilty. I refused to play that game. So I left. The price is we barely speak now. A high price—but worth it.' I heard Anders ask, 'Afraid of what?' Karl answered, 'Not of people. With others, she could be very direct, bold. She feared space. For example, when we drove somewhere, she always brought a cushion to cover her lap. As soon as we entered a tunnel, she’d crouch down and shield her head with the cushion.' I heard Helena exclaim, 'Really?' Karl confirmed, 'Absolutely. Every time—we had to announce when we exited. Later it got worse: suddenly she couldn’t drive on roads with more than one lane, couldn’t stand other cars passing close to us. Then she couldn’t go near water. Our vacations became nearly impossible.' I imagined Karl’s father hunched over maps, planning holidays to avoid highways and tunnels—a picture forming in my mind of a general preparing for battle.",

    "text": "[2005-02-15 19:37:15] apartment living room | I heard Nils Nils say, 'My mother is exactly the opposite—she fears nothing. I think she’s the most fearless person I’ve ever met. I remember biking with her through the city to the theater. She’d pedal fast onto sidewalks, weave through crowds, straight into traffic. Once the police stopped her. She wouldn’t nod, admit fault, apologize. “Never again, officer”—she claimed she was innocent. Where she rode was her decision. That’s how she was when I was little. If any teacher criticized me, she’d immediately fire back. I had no faults. I was always right. When I was six, she sent me on vacation to Greece alone.' I heard Kristina gasp, 'Alone? By yourself?' Nils replied, 'No, with a friend and their family. But I was six—spending two weeks in a foreign country with a strange family—wasn’t that a bit much?' Karl remarked, 'It was the seventies—back then, anything went.' I heard Nils continue, 'My mother embarrassed me in many situations. She’s utterly shameless, capable of the most shocking things; if she did it to protect me, I’d wish I could vanish into the ground.' I recalled Nils Nils’s mother, remembering how Nils described her shameless nature—the kind that made him wish he could disappear into a hole in the ground.\n[2005-02-15 19:37:20] apartment living room | I heard Karl Larsdal ask, 'Where’s your father?' Nils Nils replied, 'Not that kind at all. He was completely unpredictable. When he had an episode, anything could happen. We just waited for him to do something terrible so the police would come and take him away. Many times we had to flee—my mother, my brother, and I. Just run away from him, that’s all.' I looked at her and asked, 'What would he do?' I heard her say, 'Oh, anything. He might climb down drainpipes or jump out the window. He could turn extremely violent. Blood, broken glass, violence. Then the police would arrive, and everything would calm down again. As long as he was home, I was always waiting for disaster to strike. But when it actually happened, I was always calm. For me, when the worst occurred, it was almost a relief: I knew I could handle it. The hard part was waiting for it to happen.' I recalled the fragmented bits Nils Nils had told me before. I thought about the unbearable tension she described while waiting for disaster, and that strange sense of relief when it finally came.\n[2005-02-15 19:37:25] apartment living room | I saw Nils Nils smile slightly after a brief silence. Nils Nils said, 'Now I remember a story! Once, we had to escape from Dad and go stay with our grandmother in Rogadal county. I must’ve been five, my brother seven. When we returned to Halvik, the apartment was full of gas. Dad had left the valve open for days. When Mom opened the door, she felt it being forced open by pressure. She turned back and told Matthias to take me downstairs, to wait on the street. Only after we’d gone did she enter to shut off the gas. On the street, Matthias said—I remember this clearly—'Do you know Mom might die now?' I answered, 'Yes, I know.' Later that day, I accidentally overheard Mom talking to him on the phone. 'Are you trying to kill us?' she asked. Not exaggerated at all, but stating a serious fact. 'Do you really want to kill us?'\" I heard Anders say, \"That’s hard to top.\" Then he turned to Kristina and asked, \"Just you left. How are your parents? Are they still alive?\" The image of the door being forced open by gas pressure flashed through my mind. I watched Nils Nils recounting the memory and felt a pang in my chest.\n[2005-02-15 19:37:30] apartment living room | I heard Kristina say, 'Yes, but they’re old. They live in Uppsala and are Pentecostal. In the environment where I grew up, I felt guilty about everything, even the tiniest little things. But they’re good people—that’s their life’s work. When winter ends and the snow melts, leaving sand on the sidewalks, do you know what they do?' Since she was looking at me, I answered, 'No, I don’t.' I heard her continue, 'They sweep the sand into a pile and return it to the road authority.' I heard Anders burst out laughing, 'Really?' Then Karl Larsdal said in my ear, 'It’s true—he drinks boiled water, and they return the sand from their doorstep to the road authority. They’re too good, so good they can hardly be real. I’m sure they see me, their son-in-law, as the devil’s test upon them.'\n[2005-02-15 19:37:35] apartment bedroom | I saw Kristina nod and smile slightly. I heard Helena ask, 'What was it like growing up with them?' Kristina replied, 'I thought for a long time that their world was the whole world—that this was simply how things were. All my friends, all my parents’ friends, belonged to the same sect. There was no outside life. When I broke away, I also broke away from all my friends.' A voice asked, 'How old were you then?' Kristina answered, 'Twelve.' I heard Helena exclaim, 'Twelve? How did you have the strength—or the maturity—to do that?' Kristina responded, 'I don’t know. I just did it. It was hard, truly hard. I lost all my friends.' I heard Nils Nils repeat in surprise, 'Twelve years old?' Then Anders asked, 'So do you drink coffee in the morning now?' Kristina answered, 'Yes, though not when I’m back there.' I gazed at Kristina, amazed at how a twelve-year-old girl could possess such decisive strength to break away from her entire world.\n[2005-02-15 19:37:35] apartment kitchen | I heard us burst into laughter. I stood up and began clearing plates. I saw Karl Larsdal also rise, holding his own plate. I dumped empty shells into the trash, rinsed the plates, and put them in the dishwasher. I saw Karl step back and lean against the fridge. I turned around. I heard Anders shout, 'You defected, Karl Larsdal?' Karl said to me, 'Fascinating.' I asked, 'What’s fascinating?' He replied, 'What we’re talking about. Or rather, how we’re talking. Sterson had a word for this. I remember he called it “tale-night.” A night when people open up, and everyone tells a story.' I said, 'Yes.' Then I suggested to Karl, 'Go for a walk? I need a smoke.' I heard him say, 'Okay.' I savored the word 'tale-night' in my mind. I felt this truly was a night when people opened their hearts.\n[2005-02-15 19:38:00] apartment kitchen | I saw Anders follow us out. Two minutes later, we stood in the middle of the yard. I held a lit cigarette between my fingers and saw both of them with their hands in their pockets. I saw Anders reach up and brush his hair back. I heard Anders say, 'Going for a smoke? I’ll come too.' Then he said, 'I have one more story I thought about telling earlier but didn’t. It’s about someone who lost everything he had. But I think it’s better told here. It was in Spain. I ran a restaurant with a friend. That was truly a wonderful life. Nights without sleep, wild on drugs and alcohol, sunbathing during the day, then starting all over again at seven or eight in the evening. I think it was the best period of my life. I was absolutely free, completely spontaneous.' I felt the cold outside, and the wind was strong. Fireworks exploded all around us.\n[2005-02-15 19:38:30] apartment kitchen | I saw Anders shrug. I heard Karl Larsdal laugh out loud. I heard Karl Larsdal ask, 'And then what?' Anders replied, 'Then I probably became too spontaneous. We had an office upstairs above the bar, and I slept with my partner’s wife—I just couldn’t help myself. Of course, he caught us, and after that, cooperation was impossible. But one day I’ll go back. The only question is whether to bring Helena.' I said, 'Maybe that’s not the life she dreams of?' Anders answered, 'But we could rent a summer house there for a month every half year. Granada or somewhere else. What do you think?' I replied, 'Sounds nice.' I heard Karl say, 'I never have any downtime at all.' Anders asked, 'What do you mean? This year?' Karl replied, 'No, never. I work every single day of the week—Saturdays, Sundays, all year round. Maybe only Christmas Eve is an exception.' Anders pressed, 'Why?'\n[2005-02-15 19:38:40] apartment kitchen | I tossed the cigarette butt and crushed it firmly underfoot. I heard myself say, 'Let’s go back up.'",

    "text": "[2005-02-15 19:38:50] Halvik | I knew that until late 2003, I had spent several months in a basement room in Åkshof preparing my second novel. Only then did I finally get an office in central Halvik.\n[2005-02-15 19:40:00] apartment kitchen | As far as I knew, this studio apartment belonged to a friend of Nils Nils and contained a small kitchen, shower, and sofa. I moved stacks of books and my computer here during the Christmas-to-New-Year period and started working here from New Year's Day onward.\n[2005-02-15 19:40:10] apartment kitchen | I knew the novel was in fact already finished. It was a hundred and thirty pages long, a story about a father and son crab fishing, then shifting into an essay on angels, and finally moving into the life of one of the sons who grows up living alone and self-harming.\n[2005-02-15 19:50:00] apartment kitchen | I heard Jorgensen say to me over a late-night phone call: \"Too simple. This won't do. This isn't a novel. You have to tell a story, Grete Lundnes! You have to tell a story!\" I knew the publisher had originally wanted to publish this book, but after hearing Jorgensen's advice delivered in that unnatural tone, a great uncertainty took hold in my mind.\n[2005-02-15 19:50:10] apartment kitchen | On the first workday of 2004, I sat before my new desk, staring at the blank screen. I realized Jorgensen was right.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:00] apartment living room | Half an hour later, I leaned back, my gaze sweeping across the poster from an art exhibition hanging behind the desk. I remembered it was from a Piotr Glownia exhibition I had seen with Tonje years ago in Barcelona—a moment from my former life.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:10] apartment living room | I saw four images on the poster: one I once mistook for a urinating angel, a bird's wing, a photograph of a 1920s pilot, and a hand of a corpse.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:15] apartment living room | I looked out the window. I saw the sky above the hospital across the street was clear and bright blue. Low sunlight shimmered on windows, road signs, and passing cars. I noticed people walking on the sidewalk wrapped tightly in winter clothes, their breath rising like flames in the cold air.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:20] apartment living room | I let my gaze drift across the floor. I was in a room with engineered hardwood flooring, and about two meters from my chair, I suddenly saw how the knots and wood grain formed an image that resembled Christ wearing a crown of thorns.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:25] apartment living room | I saw a damp stain on the ceiling that looked like a running dog, patches of peeling paint on the front steps resembling snow-covered valleys and mountain peaks, and a shape like an upside-down cloud. I felt no reaction to the image of Christ I had seen—only registered it. I thought such irregular patterns could probably be found on all buildings.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:30] apartment living room | Ten minutes later I stood up to fill the kettle. I realized I must have just seen something move. Suddenly I recalled a childhood news report about a missing fishing boat—I had seen a similar image in the water back then.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:35] apartment living room | In the few seconds while filling the kettle, I remembered our family's teak-framed television, and snowflakes flying past the dim hillside outside the window. I recalled the face that suddenly appeared on the surface of the sea on the TV screen.\n[2005-02-15 19:51:40] apartment living room | What flooded into my mind was the atmosphere of family life back then. I remembered the springs of the 70s and the residential neighborhoods—those scenes felt almost nostalgic.\n[2005-02-15 19:52:00] apartment bedroom | Just then the phone rang, making me jump. In the quiet office, the telephone suddenly rang. I realized no one knew my number here.\n[2005-02-15 19:52:10] apartment bedroom | The ringing stopped only after five rings. The water was nearly boiling, hissing in the kettle. I recalled how I used to think that hissing sound resembled someone slowly approaching.\n[2005-02-15 19:52:30] apartment bedroom | I opened the coffee jar, made my coffee, got dressed to go out. Before leaving, I paused, wanting to take one last look at the face on the board. I saw steam rising from the cup.\n[2005-02-15 19:52:45] apartment bedroom | The mark on the board truly looked like Christ. I saw his face half-turned, eyes gazing toward the fields, a crown of thorns around his head, as if he were in pain.\n[2005-02-15 19:52:50] apartment bedroom | I realized it wasn't the face before me that mattered, but the sudden reappearance of something long forgotten. I found that while specific details of my childhood were blurry, I remembered the room furnishings and places I'd been with perfect clarity.\n[2005-02-15 19:53:00] hospital | I walked onto the street holding my coffee cup. As I crossed the road, I made a decision. I felt an oddly exposed embarrassment, carrying an indoor cup outside. I decided I’d get my morning coffee in a thick paper cup from 7-11 from now on.\n[2005-02-15 19:53:10] Halvick/apartment | I walked over to the bench outside the hospital, sat down on the icy seat, lit a cigarette, and watched the road below. I could feel the coffee starting to turn lukewarm.\n[2005-02-15 20:00:00] apartment kitchen | Sunlight bathed the ground. I remembered this morning the thermometer outside the kitchen showed minus twenty degrees. Even though the sun is out now, I thought the temperature might still be around minus fifteen.\n[2005-02-15 20:01:00] apartment kitchen | I took out my phone from my pocket to check for missed calls. I thought about the child we were waiting for, due to arrive any week now. I realized I was ready—Nils Nils could call at any moment saying the baby was coming.\n[2005-02-15 20:02:00] Mochengdao Road / apartment window | I saw the traffic light on the gentle slope ticking. Then I saw two middle-aged women in white coats emerge from the entrance below. There were no vehicles passing on the street. I saw those two women each holding a cigarette tucked close under their arms, walking in small steps to keep warm against the cold. I noticed those two middle-aged women. I thought they looked like a pair of peculiar ducks.\n[2005-02-15 20:03:00] apartment kitchen | I saw the ticking sound of the traffic light stop, and cars speeding out. I heard the sound of studded winter tires rolling over asphalt. I watched the cars burst from the shadow on the slope onto the sunlit road, like a pack of panting dogs.\n[2005-02-15 20:05:00] apartment kitchen | I put my phone back into my pocket and gripped the coffee cup with both hands. I saw steam rising slowly from the cup, mingling with the smoke drifting from my mouth.\n[2005-02-15 20:05:30] Leivik / Tvet | Suddenly, I heard the school bell ringing, and the children's noise immediately quieted down. I saw this school squeezed between two apartment buildings, only twenty meters away from my office. I noticed them first.\n[2005-02-15 20:05:40] Halvik / apartment | I realized that the sounds and surroundings here were unfamiliar to me. I thought writing is about bringing things out from the shadows. I was thinking about how I could reach that goal in writing.\n[2005-02-15 20:05:50] Leivik / Tibaken | I sat drinking coffee in this neighborhood of Halvik. I saw cigarette smoke rise and disperse into the cold air. I felt my muscles contracting from the cold. I was pondering questions about writing and existence.\n[2005-02-15 20:06:00] Leivik / Tibaken | I noticed the shouts from the schoolyard arriving at regular intervals. I saw the morning streets clogged with vehicles, workers gathering at coffee shops for breakfast. I noticed they wore safety boots, had tape measures in their pockets, and their phones kept ringing. I understood this was one of the rhythms experienced daily in this transportation hub area. I knew morning traffic pressure was always heavy.\n[2005-02-15 20:06:10] Halvik / apartment | I watched the men and women filling the streets in the next hour, difficult to categorize. From their soft, high-quality clothing, I sensed their days were mostly spent in offices. I speculated they might be lawyers, TV journalists, architects, advertising copywriters, or project managers at insurance companies.\n[2005-02-15 20:06:20] Halvik / apartment | I saw nurses and assistant nurses pouring out from the bus in front of the hospital. I noticed that around eight o'clock streams of people grew denser, then gradually thinned out. I saw one or two retired elders dragging wheeled suitcases appear on the sidewalk, followed by mothers or fathers pushing baby strollers. At this point, the street traffic before my eyes had become dominated by freight vans, large trucks, small-tonnage trucks, buses, and taxis. I knew most of those getting off the buses were middle-aged, overwhelmingly women, with an occasional young person.\n[2005-02-15 20:07:00] apartment bedroom | I looked out the window and saw a group of kindergarten children walking past, barely taller than a flock of sheep. I observed their teacher, towering above them, looking very serious. Sunlight shone brilliantly on the windows across from Office Street. I noticed all the children wore identical reflective vests. To me, the shepherd-like teacher seemed more on the verge of boredom. I knew it would be hard to hear footsteps on the outer hallway stairs now. As far as I knew, these children walked like fairy-tale characters enchanted by mountain trolls.\n[2005-02-15 20:07:30] apartment bedroom | I noticed people in the garden area sweeping fallen leaves or trimming branches on the lawn. I saw someone repairing uneven spots on the asphalt path. The sounds of ongoing labor from the surrounding area reached my ears, loud enough for me to feel the presence of their activity. As far as I know, this work is meant to keep the grass clean and tidy, or perhaps the property owner is repainting a nearby rental unit.\n[2005-02-15 20:08:00] apartment bedroom | I saw a sudden surge of office workers and businesspeople flood onto the street, instantly filling every roadside restaurant to capacity. I noticed this tide of people quickly recede just as suddenly, leaving the streets empty again. I watched schoolchildren passing by my window after school let out. I observed that the children appeared relaxed and cheerful on their way home. I noticed that when they headed to school in the morning, they still carried the quiet drowsiness left over from the night before. I know it’s lunchtime. I understand this urban pattern will repeat itself again, only in reverse order. I realize that for children in the morning, their innate wariness hasn’t yet begun.",

    "text": "[2005-02-15 20:10:00] apartment living room | I looked out the window and saw the number of people waiting at the bus stop in front of the hospital steadily increasing. I noticed the streets were now mostly filled with private cars, and more and more pedestrians appeared. I saw people emerging from all the courtyard gates and stairways. I heard the loud shouts and laughter of young people heading out for nightlife after ten p.m., even boisterous noise past three a.m. Sunlight fell precisely onto the wall inside my window. I heard slow, heavy footsteps beginning to climb the outer staircase. I felt the entire residential area sink into calm after the peak of activity, until nightlife began anew. At six a.m., I heard buses start moving on the roads again—another day had begun. From my observation, the peak of activity usually occurs around five p.m. I know this stillness will last until evening. I understand that traffic congestion begins again at six a.m.\n[2005-02-15 20:15:00] apartment living room | I realized that from this rigid pattern of life, one can equally understand geometric regularity and biological diversity. I thought that in apparent chaos, life seems to climb up from an endless well. I felt that this disorder is like a kind of gravity, prompting reflection on the rhythm of civilizations rising and falling. I sensed that just as a heart doesn't care whose chest it beats in, a city doesn't care who keeps it running. I thought that 150 years from now, when everyone alive today is gone, new faces will still pass through the intersection in the same patterns, resembling us closely.\n[2005-02-15 20:16:00] apartment living room | I dropped my cigarette butt on the ground and drank the last sip of coffee from my cup, now completely cold.\n[2005-02-15 20:17:00] apartment living room | I realized that what I see with my eyes is life, but what I ponder is death.\n[2005-02-15 20:18:00] apartment living room | I stood up, rubbed my hands against my thighs a few times, and then walked toward the traffic light at the intersection below.\n[2005-02-15 20:18:30] apartment living room | I watched as a massive trailer truck pulled up; when it braked, the whole vehicle jolted and came to a stop right before the crosswalk as the traffic light turned red. I saw snowmelt swirl up from the rear ends of passing cars. The clanking of heavy metal chains from the big trailer rang in my ears.\n[2005-02-15 20:20:00] apartment living room | As I crossed in front of the truck, I tried to catch the driver’s eye. I saw his gaze fixed on his hands, putting something he had been holding—perhaps a map—back inside the cab. I gave a small nod in his direction at last. I knew the trailer truck was Polish. I realized that whenever a car stops because of me, I always feel a sense of guilt, as if I owe them something—and the larger the vehicle, the heavier this feeling becomes. I originally wanted to nod at the driver to correct this imbalance, but I found he hadn’t seen me. I thought, it doesn’t matter—he would have had to brake anyway.\n[2005-02-15 20:20:10] apartment living room | I also sat down on the other side of the table. I said to her, 'It might be a bit cold now.'\n[2005-02-15 20:20:15] apartment living room | I heard her say, \"It's okay. Can I start eating? I'm starving.\"\n[2005-02-15 20:20:20] apartment living room | I poured some wine into the glass and added some potatoes to the plate. I watched her eat the meat and vegetables. I said, \"Go ahead and eat.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:05:30] Rogadal | As far as I know, he went on to study for another four years and became a high school engineer, while also playing as a goalkeeper for the local club in his spare time. I thought about how he must have had a good time back then.\n[2005-02-15 21:06:00] Rogadal | As far as I know, he met Ingrid, who was then working as a secretary at a mining company, at a dance. They became a couple and got married. I thought they must have seemed very well-matched at the time.\n[2005-02-15 21:06:30] Halvik/Royal Theatre | I knew that Ingrid dreamed of becoming an actress, and after she was accepted into the Halvik National Academy of Dramatic Art, Roland abandoned his former life entirely and moved with her to the capital. I learned that she was destined for a career as an actress at the Royal Theatre, while he was left with nothing—previously just a goalkeeper and high school engineer from the remote town of Rogadal, now merely the husband of a beautiful actress at the country’s most prestigious theatre. I realized there was an unbridgeable gap between those two lives.\n[2005-02-15 21:07:00] Halvik | I learned they had two children in quick succession, but that wasn’t enough to keep them together, and they divorced soon after. I knew he had his first episode shortly thereafter.\n[2005-02-15 21:08:00] Halvik | As far as I know, his illness had no boundaries, plunging him from manic peaks to depressive depths; once it took hold, he never managed to escape it. I learned that from then on, he kept being hospitalized and discharged repeatedly. I knew that from the mid-1970s until spring 2004, when I first met him, he had not held a job.\n[2005-02-15 21:09:00] Halvik/apartment | I thought that although I had seen his photo, when I opened the door and saw him standing there, I was still unprepared for what I saw. I realized his face was completely open, as if there were nothing at all between him and the world. I felt he had no defense, no protection against the world whatsoever; in my heart, I marveled at how deeply painful it was to witness this.\n[2005-02-15 21:10:00] apartment doorway | I nodded at him and shook his hand. I heard him ask me, \"So you're Grete Lundnes?\" Then I heard his voice say, \"Moensson, Nils Nils's dad.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:10:30] apartment living room | I saw Nils Nils holding Vanya behind me. I watched him stand quietly, looking at Vanya, who looked back at him just as silently. I saw his eyes light up. I said to him, \"I've heard so much about you, please come in!\" I heard Nils Nils say, \"Hi Dad, this is Vanya.\" And then I heard him utter, \"Oh.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:11:00] apartment living room | I observed his face relax, yet his movements were stiff, almost mechanical. I watched as we walked into the living room. I said to him, \"Give me your coat, and then let's go inside and have a cup of coffee.\" I heard him ask as we entered the living room, \"Did you paint this?\" I answered, \"Yes.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:11:30] apartment living room | I saw him walk over to the nearest wall and examine it closely. I heard him ask, \"Did you paint this, Grete Lundnes?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" He exclaimed to me, \"Excellent! You painted it so precisely, so very precise. I'm painting at home right now, you know. The bedroom is turquoise, the living room cream-colored. But I haven't continued with the bedroom—I haven't done the interior walls yet.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:12:00] apartment living room | I was observing Nils Nils; there was something I had never seen in her before. I saw her accommodating him, yielding to him in a certain way, being like a child to him, attentive and present with him. I heard Nils Nils say, \"It's good, surely looks nice.\" Then I heard his voice: \"Yes, nice, surely looks nice.\" I thought she also looked down on him, because I realized she always tried to hide her shame, but never quite succeeded.\n[2005-02-15 21:15:00] apartment living room | I saw him sit down on the sofa. I poured coffee and went into the kitchen to put some cinnamon buns we had bought that morning onto a plate. I noticed he ate silently. I watched Nils Nils sit beside him, placing Vanya on her lap, showing him her child. I realized I had never before considered how deeply significant this was for her.\n[2005-02-15 21:20:00] apartment living room | I heard him say, \"The cinnamon buns are good, and the coffee is excellent too. Did you make it, Grete Lundnes?\" I answered, \"Yes.\" He asked, \"Do you have a coffee machine?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Good.\" After a brief silence, I heard him continue, \"I hope everything is well with you. I only have one daughter, Nils Nils. It means a lot to visit you, and I'm truly glad and comforted.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:25:00] apartment living room | I saw him nod. I took the warm little bundle, Vanya, noticing how drowsy she was, barely able to keep her eyes open. I watched Nils Nils get up and go to the shelf to fetch the photo album. I saw the way he looked at the photographs. I heard Nils Nils ask, \"Do you want to see photos, Dad? Pictures from when Vanya was first born.\" She said to me, \"Hold Vanya for a moment.\" I heard him utter a soft \"Hmm\" at each photo he viewed.\n[2005-02-15 21:35:00] apartment living room | I saw after they finished the photo album, he reached for the coffee cup on the table, noting how he brought it slowly, carefully, and deliberately to his lips, taking two large sips. I watched him nod at me. I heard him say, \"I've only been to Leivik once, Grete Lundnes—went to Narvik. I was goalkeeper for a team, and we went there to play against a team from Leivik.\" I responded, \"Oh really?\" He answered, \"Yes, really.\" I heard Nils Nils say, \"Grete Lundnes plays football too.\" I explained, \"That was a long time ago, and I wasn't very good.\" He asked, \"Were you a goalkeeper?\" I replied, \"No.\" Then I heard him say softly, \"Oh.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:40:00] apartment living room | I noticed he took another large sip of coffee, again with that deliberate, calculated motion. I saw him stand up. I met Nils Nils’s gaze. After a brief silence, I heard him say, \"Well, well, very good.\" As the cup returned to its coaster, he said, \"Now I'd like to go home.\" I heard Nils Nils say, \"But you just got here!\" He replied, \"I feel satisfied. I’d like to have a meal with you both—I'll treat. Is Tuesday convenient?\" I heard Nils Nils finally say, \"Yes, it's convenient.\" He concluded, \"Then it's settled—five o'clock on Tuesday.\" I realized whether it was convenient would ultimately be her decision.",

    "text": "[2005-02-15 21:42:00] apartment bedroom | I saw him glance into the open bedroom door and pause. I watched as we followed him inside. I saw him step up to the wall, tilt his head back, and look at the wall behind the large wood stove. I heard him ask, \"Did you paint this too?\" I answered, \"Yes.\" He asked, \"Can I take a closer look?\" I said, \"Of course.\" He told me, \"This must have been hard to paint—I know that much. Looks great though!\"\n[2005-02-15 21:43:00] apartment bedroom | I felt Vanya lying across one arm, and since I couldn’t see her face, I placed her on the bed. I saw her smile. I saw Roland sit down by the bed, one hand gently holding her tiny feet. I heard Vanya make a small sound. I heard Nils Nils ask, \"Don't you want to hold her? You can, if you'd like.\" He replied, \"No. I've seen her now.\"\n[2005-02-15 21:45:00] apartment foyer | I saw him stand up, walk into the hallway, and put on his coat. I felt him embrace me before leaving, his stubble scratching my cheek. I saw him hug Nils Nils, then tickle Vanya's feet, and then watched him go downstairs in his long coat. I heard him say to me, 'It was a pleasure meeting you, Grete Lundnes.'\n[2005-02-15 21:46:00] apartment living room | I watched as Nils Nils handed Vanya to me, and I noticed she avoided my gaze. I saw her walk into the living room to clear the table, and I followed behind. I observed the lightness of her steps. I heard her ask while walking, 'What do you think of him?' I replied, 'He's a good man, but completely defenseless toward the world. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so vulnerable.' She asked, 'He's like a child, isn't he?' I said, 'Yes, exactly. No doubt about it.'\n[2005-02-15 21:47:00] apartment kitchen | I saw her pass by me, one hand holding three coffee cups stacked together, the other carrying the basket with pastries. I said to her, 'Vanya certainly has a special grandfather.' I heard her ask, 'Yes, but what happens now?' I answered, 'It'll be fine. Of course it will.' I thought her voice held no irony; I realized the question came straight from some dark corner within her.\n[2005-02-15 21:48:00] apartment kitchen | I saw her speaking as she placed the cups into the dishwasher. I heard her say to me, 'But I don't want him in our lives.' I told her, 'If it's just like this, I believe it’ll be fine—occasional visits, a cup of coffee. Then maybe one or two dinners at his place. After all, he’s the child’s grandfather.'\n[2005-02-15 21:49:00] apartment kitchen | I saw Nils Nils close the dishwasher door. I watched her take a transparent plastic bag from the bottom drawer, put the remaining three pastries inside, and tie it shut. I noticed her walk past me and place the bag in the refrigerator in the hallway. I heard her say to me, 'But he won’t be satisfied with this, I know. Once he’s reconnected, he’ll start calling. And he’ll only call when everything’s falling apart. He has no boundaries. You have to understand that.'\n[2005-02-15 21:50:00] apartment entrance | I watched her walk into the living room to pick up the last few plates, and I followed behind. I noticed the doorbell rang. I saw it was Roland, and I found his eyes wild. I said to her, 'Anyway, let’s give it a try and see how things go.' I heard her reply, 'Okay.' I wondered, who else could it be at this hour? Could it be that crazy neighbor again?\n[2005-02-15 21:51:00] apartment stairwell | I watched myself put on shoes and go downstairs with him after handing over the child. We arrived at the entrance foyer, and I pointed out the button to him—I saw it was on the wall to the right of the main door. I heard him say, 'I can't get out—I can't find the unlock button. I’ve looked and looked, but I just can’t find it. Can you help me?' I replied, 'Of course. I’ll hand Vanya to Nils Nils and come right away.' I heard him say, 'I’ll write it down so I remember for next time. Right side of the main door.'\n[2005-02-15 21:55:00] Hårvik / Roland's home | I saw him show us the walls he had painted. I noticed him busy in the kitchen, while Vanya slept in her stroller in the hallway. I watched Nils Nils and me sitting in the living room talking. I noticed photographs of Nils Nils and her brother as children hanging on the wall, along with newspaper clippings beside them. I praised his craftsmanship. I knew we would have dinner at his place three days later. I learned that when we arrived, he hadn’t started preparing the meal yet. I saw him brighten with satisfaction when I praised his work.\n[2005-02-15 21:56:00] Roland's home / terrace | I saw Nils Nils looking down at the table. I observed that there was no balcony, but instead a rooftop terrace accessible through a passage between two other roofs. I said to Nils Nils, 'He’s really proud of you.' I heard her say, 'Let’s go out on the balcony, you can have a cigarette.' I was on this rooftop terrace adjacent to Sture Square, from which the entire Östermalm district lay in view.\n[2005-02-15 21:57:00] Roland's home / terrace | I walked to the edge of the terrace and looked down. I saw small piles of snow and patches of ice still lingering on the sidewalk, nearly eroded away by the mild weather. I smelled dust and exhaust fumes. Before me lay asphalt stained gray. I saw March sunlight glinting on the wall ahead of me and on the road below. I thought, it’s March already. I felt the sunlight so bright and strong, powerful enough even on a damp day to pierce through clouds and break through every barrier of the dark world.\n[2005-02-15 21:58:00] Roland's House/Terrace | I stubbed out my cigarette in the ashtray on the table and opened my arms to embrace her. After a while, we went back inside. I noticed the living room was still empty, so we walked into the kitchen to find him. I heard her say to me, 'Hold me.'\n[2005-02-15 21:59:00] Roland's House/Kitchen | I saw him standing by the stove, pouring a can of mushrooms into a hot pan. I watched as he then added sliced zucchini. I noticed a pot of pasta boiling beside it. I said to him, 'That looks good.' I heard him reply, 'Yes, it really is.' I heard the sizzle of liquid hitting the bottom of the pan. I saw the water in the pot had come to a boil.\n[2005-02-15 22:00:00] Roland's House/Kitchen | I noticed a can of saltwater shrimp and a carton of heavy cream on the kitchen counter. I heard him say, 'I used to eat at the Vikings all the time. But on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, I eat here. I cook for Berit.' I heard Nils Nils ask, 'Is there anything we can help with?' He replied, 'No, just sit for now. I'll bring it over when it's ready.' I knew Berit was his girlfriend.\n[2005-02-15 22:15:00] Roland's House/Living Room | I listened as he talked at length about being a goalkeeper for the football team in Rogadal. Later, I heard him speak about his past work in warehouse planning and design, and then about the horse he once kept. I smelled the food, and the aroma reminded me strongly of my own cooking during student days. I recalled my first year at Baysang University, when I lived alone in a rented apartment in Aragen and cooked for myself. I noticed he explained everything with great precision, as if painstakingly choosing technical terms for each thing.\n[2005-02-15 22:45:00] Roland's House/Living Room | I saw him grab paper and pen to calculate exactly how many days he had left to live. I searched for Nils Nils’s eyes, but she refused to look at me. I watched as we stood up immediately after finishing the ice cream on the table, preparing to leave. I heard us say we were afraid we had to go—Vannia needed to get home for feeding and diaper change. I heard him seem pleased upon hearing this. I learned the dessert was a two-liter box of ice cream on the table. I knew we had agreed beforehand not to stay too long. I inwardly remarked that the visit might have been a bit too long for him.\n[2005-02-15 22:50:00] Roland's House/Living Room | I walked into the hallway to get my coat. After tying the last shoelace, I stood up and returned to the doorway, glancing into the living room. I saw Nils Nils sitting on his lap, his hands around her waist, his mouth moving as he spoke. I heard Nils Nils whisper something to him. I heard him say she was his little girl, how she’d grown so big, and asked her to come sit on his lap for a moment. But I couldn’t hear what exactly he said in the living room. I inwardly felt that the scene was somewhat strange.\n[2005-02-15 22:52:00] Roland's House/Entrance Hall | I watched Nils Nils step into the hallway. I was examining the photos on the wall. I watched her put on her coat. I saw her father come out to say goodbye, give me a hug like last time, glance at Vannia, and embrace Nils Nils. I watched him stand at the door seeing us off, wave one final time, then turn and walk back inside. I thought about stepping back a few paces, so she wouldn’t know someone had seen it and make the moment even worse. I noticed Vannia was sleeping in the stroller.\n[2005-02-15 22:55:00] Apartment | I thought about how I never mentioned a word about that small scene I had witnessed between them. I saw her bend toward him, becoming a ten-year-old girl again. I realized that although she resisted, that very resistance canceled out her maturity. I thought no adult could truly handle such a situation with ease. I realized he didn’t think about these things—he didn’t know the boundaries. To him, she was simply his daughter, a species beyond age.\n[2005-02-15 23:00:00] Apartment | As far as I knew, just as Nils Nils had anticipated, he began calling us afterward—regardless of time or occasion. I learned that Nils Nils had made an agreement with him about specific days and hours when he could call. I understood he seemed to like this arrangement, yet also found it constraining: if we didn’t answer, he would feel deeply offended.\n[2005-02-15 23:10:00] Apartment | I heard him ask me if he could sing a song. I heard him begin to sing—about a migrant worker building roads in Rogadal. His voice was powerful, full of energy. Though slightly off-key, the performance was still impressive. When he finished, I repeatedly told him it was a wonderful song. I knew it was a song he had written himself, performed once at Halvik, and even broadcast on the radio.\n[2005-02-15 23:15:00] apartment | I heard him say to me, 'I know you write books, Grete Lundnes. I haven't read them yet, but I've heard nothing but good things. You should know that. I'm very proud of you, Grete Lundnes. You see, I...'\nI replied, 'I'm glad to hear you say that.'\nHe asked, 'Are you doing all right with Nils Nils?'\nI answered, 'Fine.'\nHe asked, 'Are you treating her well?'\nI said, 'Yes.'\nHe finally urged, 'Good. Don't ever leave her, never. Do you understand?'\n[2005-02-15 23:18:00] apartment | Then I heard him cry. I comforted him, 'We're fine, there's no need to worry.' He said to me, 'I'm just an old man, but I've been through a lot, you know. More than most people. Now there's nothing left in my life worth shouting about. But I've already counted how many days I have left to live. Did you know that?'\n[2005-02-15 23:20:00] apartment | I replied, 'Yes. When we visited your home, you showed us how you calculated it.' He continued, 'Right, right. But you didn't see Berit, did you?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'She's been very good to me.' I told him, 'As far as I know, that's true.' I noticed he suddenly became alert and asked, 'As far as you know? How do you know that?'\n[2005-02-15 23:22:00] apartment | I began, 'Well, Nils Nils told me about her. And Ingrid too. You know...' I heard him interrupt, 'I see. I won't bother you anymore, Grete Lundnes. You probably have important things to do.' Before I could finish saying, 'You're not bothering me at all,' he hung up without waiting for a goodbye, saying only, 'Tell Nils Nils I called. Take care.'\n[2005-02-15 23:25:00] apartment | I saw from the display that despite the long conversation, it had only lasted eight minutes. I looked at Nils Nils and told her what had happened. I heard Nils Nils say indifferently, 'You don't have to listen to that stuff. Next time he calls, just don't answer.' I replied, 'I didn't mind.' She finally said, 'I do.' I realized she was acting indifferent.\n[2005-02-16 05:00:00] apartment/desk | I saw that the next morning Vanja woke up at five, as usual. I saw Nils Nils carry her to our bed, where they both slept for a few more hours. I watched myself get up, take out my laptop, and continue working. I knew I was continuing to develop a review of a translated manuscript.\n[2005-02-16 05:30:00] apartment/desk | I thought this work was monotonous and endless. I realized that although I had already written thirty pages of commentary, I still looked forward to the work and enjoyed the time sitting down to write. I thought that I was alone in doing this textual work, and that was all I needed.\n[2005-02-16 06:00:00] apartment/backyard | I watched myself turn on the coffee machine and stand in the backyard drinking coffee, having the first cigarette of the day before anyone else got up. The sound of gurgling water reached my ears. I smelled the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Around me was the darkness of the backyard. I felt this was a moment of indulgence.\n[2005-02-16 07:30:00] apartment/desk | I went back upstairs and continued working. The gap between the buildings gradually brightened before my eyes, and the sounds of the street grew louder in my ears. I sensed something unusual in the atmosphere of the building. I noticed a thin layer of snow had fallen during the night. I felt the morning light of this day was different from before.\n[2005-02-16 08:00:00] Mochengdao Road/street | I watched myself shut down the computer at eight o'clock and put it into my bag. I walked along the street toward the small bakery. I saw the awning of the shop downstairs flapping in the wind above my head. I noticed the snow on the road had melted, but snow remained on the sidewalk, covered with footprints.\n[2005-02-16 08:05:00] small bakery | I stepped into this tiny bakery. Before me stood a red-haired, fair-skinned shopkeeper with freckles. I saw another woman with long black hair, a slightly square face, and kind deep blue eyes. I knew the shopkeepers were two women around my age. I felt like stepping into a 1940s noir film, where every woman was strikingly beautiful.\n[2005-02-16 08:10:00] small bakery | I heard the shop door jingle as the red-haired woman emerged from behind the counter. I spoke while pointing at what I wanted. I told her what I needed: 'One large yeast bread, six whole wheat rolls, and two cinnamon buns.' I knew that in Halvik even the simplest Leivik word would be questioned.",

    "text": "[2005-02-16 08:15:00] apartment entryway | I hurried home carrying a white shopping bag. I watched myself scrape snow off my shoes on the doormat. As soon as I opened the door, I heard they were already up, eating breakfast in the kitchen.\n[2005-02-16 08:20:00] apartment kitchen | I saw Vanja sitting there, waving her spoon high in the air. When I walked in, I saw her smile at me. I noticed she had porridge smeared all over her face. Instinctively, I wanted to wipe it off, to clean her face. I knew it had been a long time since she allowed us to feed her.\n[2005-02-16 08:25:00] apartment kitchen | I recalled how Nils Nils had criticized my reaction from the start, and I knew it was important not to impose rules or restrictions. I recognized parts of my father in myself. I remembered how, as a child, he couldn't tolerate even a single bread crumb on the table. I thought that practically speaking, my first impulse was to correct her behavior. I realized I had personally experienced something I deeply hated—yet I couldn't understand why I still tried so hard to pass it on to the next generation.\n[2005-02-16 08:30:00] apartment kitchen | I watched myself cut several slices of bread and put them in a small basket along with the rolls. I filled the kettle, then sat down to have breakfast with them. I noticed the butter was a bit hard; when I pressed the knife into it, I ended up squashing the bread. I saw Vanja staring at me. I suddenly lifted my head and stared straight back. I saw her flinch in her chair, then burst into laughter.\n[2005-02-16 08:35:00] apartment kitchen | I watched myself repeat the trick, lowering my head to look at the table. I saw her eyes widen cautiously. When I quickly raised my head and stared directly at her, I saw her flinch again, then burst into laughter once more. I noticed Nils Nils laughing too. I heard Nils Nils say: 'Vanja is so funny, you're so funny! My little darling!' I thought she must have believed nothing would happen again.\n[2005-02-16 08:40:00] apartment kitchen | I saw her lean forward and nuzzle Vanja’s nose with her own. I grabbed the newspaper from the table, took a big bite of bread, and skimmed the headlines. I heard the water boiling behind me on the counter, then saw the kettle switch itself off. I watched myself stand up, drop tea bags into cups, pour hot water, take a carton of milk from the fridge, then sit back down. Before me rose steam from the freshly boiled water.\n[2005-02-16 10:30:00] forest path | I saw a man in a red ski suit coming around the bend about twenty meters ahead. I recognized him as Arne.\n[2005-02-16 10:30:15] forest path | I heard him call out when he was a few meters away: 'Hey, so it's you out for a walk!'\n[2005-02-16 10:30:20] forest path | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Hi, Arne. Long time no see.\"\n[2005-02-16 10:30:30] forest path | I saw him stop beside us and glance into the stroller. I thought the scandal didn't seem to have crushed him.\n[2005-02-16 10:30:35] forest path | I heard him ask, \"She's really grown. How many months now?\"\n[2005-02-16 10:30:40] forest path | I heard Nils Nils reply, \"She just turned one two weeks ago.\"\n[2005-02-16 10:30:50] forest path | I saw him looking at me. I heard him exclaim, \"Really! Time flies.\" I noticed one of his eyes was staring blankly, completely filled with tears. As far as I knew, in recent years he had suffered from multiple illnesses—a brain tumor that was removed, then a morphine addiction that sent him to rehab. I knew he'd had a stroke after that episode, and now it seemed he'd just recovered from pneumonia.\n[2005-02-16 10:31:10] forest path | I saw he appeared even more ravaged, more vacant, walking with greater difficulty and moving more slowly. I knew he’d originally been given only two years to live. I thought that even so, there was not a trace of weakness about him—life still burned inside him. I realized it was this fierce will to live that kept pushing him forward. Anyone else enduring such suffering would likely be dead by now.\n[2005-02-16 10:31:30] forest path | I heard him say to me, \"Vidal told me your book is going to be translated into Mochengdao?\"\n[2005-02-16 10:31:35] forest path | I said to him, \"Yes.\"\n[2005-02-16 10:31:40] forest path | I heard him ask, \"When? I absolutely must see it, you know.\"\n[2005-02-16 10:31:45] forest path | I told him, \"They told me autumn, but it'll probably be next autumn.\"\n[2005-02-16 10:31:50] forest path | I heard him reply, 'I'm waiting.'\n[2005-02-16 10:32:10] forest path | I remembered he once told me he was very good at playing football. I noticed the eye he used sparkled with youthful light, though the rest of his face was lined, weather-beaten, and bloodshot. His enthusiastic tone reached my ears, even if it was uneven from being forced to slow down. As far as I knew, he had grown up in an orphanage but hadn't gone astray. I learned he had worked as a journalist for many years and published several books. I guessed in my mind he must be nearly seventy—hard to say—but he showed no sign of aging. To me, he had a quality that seemed unburdened and tireless.\n[2005-02-16 10:32:30] forest path | I knew that when he spoke passionately, his wife would look at him with loving eyes. From what I understood, she was a nurse and now nearing her limit, having to care not only for her chronically ill husband but also help their child who had just had twins.\n[2005-02-16 10:32:40] forest path | I heard him say to me, 'Well, it's good to see you, Nils Nils. And you too, Grete Lundnes.'\n[2005-02-16 10:32:45] forest path | I said to him, 'I'm glad too.'\n[2005-02-16 10:33:00] forest path | I saw him raise his hand to his forehead in a wave and then walk away. I watched as he lifted his ski poles high with each step.\n[2005-02-16 10:33:15] forest path | His straight, watery eye came into view. I felt it resembled the eye of a mythical beast. Though the image didn't stay before my eyes continuously, I realized the feeling lingered throughout the entire day.\n[2005-02-16 10:33:30] forest path | I watched him disappear around the bend, and we continued our walk. I said to Nils Nils, 'He doesn't seem like someone who's been broken down.'\n[2005-02-16 10:33:40] forest path | I heard Nils Nils say, 'No, he doesn't. But it's hard to truly see what others are really like.'\n[2005-02-16 10:35:00] beside the railway | I helped Vanya sit upright and turned her around so she could see. I saw her pointing at the train and shouting. The roar reached my ears again; I saw the train speeding through the woods. I felt a fine spray of snow blow against my face, melting instantly. I thought this time she definitely hadn't missed it.\n[2005-02-16 10:50:00] end of the railway embankment | I watched as the path came to an end beside the railway embankment. I saw a white expanse of snow-covered fields across the way, like a tablecloth laid out in the forest. The beautiful manor house came into view, and beyond it I could see the lake and the center of Nyköping on the opposite shore. To my knowledge, the owner of the manor is the Prime Minister's brother. I recalled getting lost there one summer, remembering the group of people dressed in white dining outdoors. I inwardly remarked how Bergmanesque that party had been, surrounded by the greenery of southern Södermanland countryside.\n[2005-02-16 11:00:00] return path | I walked back along the same route, lifting Vanya out of the stroller and into my arms.\n[2005-02-16 11:30:00] slope in front of the house | Half an hour later, we reached the slope. Through the window, I saw Ingrid and Vidar standing at opposite ends of the table, shouting at each other. I heard shouts coming from inside the house. I realized the snow had muffled our return, masking any sound. I guessed we had come back earlier than they expected.\n[2005-02-16 11:31:00] entrance hall | I stamped my boots a few times on the doorstep. I saw Nils Nils take Vanya from me, and I pushed the stroller into the garage. I saw Vidar standing in the hallway, putting on his coat. I knew this garage was something Vidar had built over the spring and summer seasons.\n[2005-02-16 11:31:15] entrance hall | I heard him ask me with a smile, 'How was it? Did you walk far?'\n[2005-02-16 11:31:20] entrance hall | I told him, 'No, just a short way. The weather outside was terrible!'\n[2005-02-16 11:31:30] entrance hall | I watched him pull on a pair of brown rubber boots. I heard him reply, 'Yeah, sure was.' Then he said, 'I'm just heading out—got some things to fix.'\n[2005-02-16 11:32:00] kitchen | I watched him slowly walk up the hill. I took off my coat, changed my shoes, and went into the kitchen. I saw Ingrid peeling potatoes; she had already placed Vanya in the high chair.\n[2005-02-16 11:32:30] kitchen | I watched her place a bowl of water and a measuring spoon in front of Vanya. I shoved my coat into the pile of clothes and walked past them. I heard her gentle, kind voice. I knew this would keep the child occupied for hours. I noticed Ingrid looked sad, but I sensed her movements remained calm and deliberate.\n[2005-02-16 11:32:45] kitchen | I asked her, 'What’s for dinner?'\n[2005-02-16 11:32:50] kitchen | I heard her reply, \"Lamb chops, potato wedges. And red wine sauce.\"\n[2005-02-16 11:32:55] kitchen | I said to her, \"Oh, wonderful! I love lamb the most.\"\n[2005-02-16 11:33:00] kitchen | I watched her gazing at me with a smile, and I noticed her eyes looked unusually large behind her glasses. I heard her say to me, \"I know.\"\n[2005-02-16 11:33:10] kitchen | I noticed Vanya tapping the measuring spoon in the bowl of water.\n[2005-02-16 11:33:20] kitchen | I ruffled Vanya's hair, then looked over at Inge. I said, \"You're having such a good time here, Vanya.\" Then I asked, \"Has Nils Nils gone to bed?\"\n[2005-02-16 11:33:30] kitchen | I saw Inge nod. I noticed something just outside my line of sight, no more than four meters away. I heard Nils Nils call out from the sleeping corner, \"I'm right here!\"",

    "text": "[2005-02-16 11:34:00] bedroom | I walked in and saw two beds placed at a ninety-degree angle, taking up nearly all the space in the room. I noticed she was lying on the inner bed, the duvet pulled up to her chin. I felt that although the curtains were open, it was still dim inside, almost dark. The dark, rough wooden walls came into view, as if absorbing all the light.\n[2005-02-16 11:34:15] bedroom | I heard her hoarsely call out to me, \"Are you going to take a little nap?\"\n[2005-02-16 11:34:20] bedroom | I shook my head.\n[2005-02-16 11:34:25] bedroom | I said, \"I'm going to read a bit. You go ahead and sleep.\"\n[2005-02-16 11:35:00] bedroom | I sat down by the bed and stroked her hair. Before me was a wall with photos of Vidar's grandchildren, while the opposite wall held a bookshelf. On the windowsill stood an alarm clock and a photograph of Vidar's youngest daughter. I always feel uneasy in other people's bedrooms, afraid of seeing things I'd rather not, but here I found no such discomfort.\n[2005-02-16 11:35:10] bedroom | I heard her say, \"I love you.\"\n[2005-02-16 11:35:15] bedroom | I leaned in to kiss her.\n[2005-02-16 11:40:00] living room sofa | I stood up, left the room, found the book I had brought, picked up the biography of Rimbaud, and stretched out on the sofa beneath the window. I said, \"Get some rest.\" I felt unable to face Dostoevsky, realizing it would be too strenuous to dive into him right now. I remembered this was one of those books I'd long thought I should read. What interested me most was his relationship with Africa and the time he spent living there. His poetry itself didn't attract me much, unless it revealed something unique and distinctive about his character.\n[2005-02-16 12:00:00] living room sofa | I noticed Inge bustling about in the kitchen while talking to Vanja. I thought she was such a good mother, realizing how even the most tedious chores became lively under her hands. It wasn't just that she set aside her own needs when they were together, making everything revolve around Vanja and her feelings. I realized this wasn't sacrifice; the joy she derived from it was deep and genuine.\n[2005-02-16 12:05:00] living room sofa | As far as I knew, our mother had always been like this when we were children. I couldn't imagine another woman like Inge being so utterly different from my mother. I realized that although my mother also set aside her own needs, the distance between her and her children was much greater. I recalled once going with them to a children's play area, seeing her look distracted, so I asked if she was bored, and she admitted she was.\n[2005-02-16 12:10:00] living room sofa | I knew Inge had once been an actress at the country's largest theater, with a rich and active life. As far as I knew, my mother lived a contemplative life—always observing, analyzing, reading, writing, and reflecting. I thought that if Inge wanted to, she could capture any child's attention, realizing there was a natural ease in her nature. I marveled at her strong presence, how she could transform the atmosphere simply by entering a room. I saw that Inge loved cooking, whereas my mother only cooked because she had to.\n[2005-02-16 12:30:00] hallway / chair by the wall | I saw Vidar walk past the bedroom window wearing blue overalls, noticing how he slightly hunched forward and stepped carefully. A moment later, I saw him appear again outside the living room window, heading toward the garage. I saw Vanja leaning against the kitchen cabinet while Inge lifted a frying pan off the stove. I stood up, went to the hallway, put on my jacket, hat, and boots, opened the door, and sat down on the chair by the wall to smoke. I watched Vidar carry a bucket out of the garage.\n[2005-02-16 12:30:15] chair by the wall | I heard him ask me, \"Could you give me a hand in a bit? About ten minutes?\"\n[2005-02-16 12:30:20] chair by the wall | I replied, \"Of course.\"\n[2005-02-16 12:40:00] outside | I watched him nod and go toward the corner of the house, so I turned my gaze to the distance. I felt the daylight fading, and before me spread the uneven, encroaching darkness of night. I noticed how the trunks and branches at the edge of the forest had already turned into a black mass. I observed the feeble February sunlight slowly diminishing, until everything was swallowed by blackness and night covered the earth and sky.\n[2005-02-16 12:41:00] outside | I felt a sudden happiness seize me.\n[2005-02-16 12:42:00] outside | I felt the light across the fields, the chill in the air, and the silence within the forest. Before me loomed the menacing darkness, and I felt it was like a breath being blown straight into my heart—an evening in February. I realized it awakened all my dead memories of February evenings. I marveled at how rich and full it felt, as if my entire life were gathered here. I thought time itself seemed pierced by it, and a different light unfolded across my memory.\n[2005-02-16 12:45:00] storage room | I crushed my cigarette in the snow and tossed it into the large bin, then walked to the ground-level storage room behind the house. I saw Vidar inside, tightening screws onto the lid of the freezer. I felt the sense of happiness transform into an equally strong sadness. I silently told myself that before we left, I must clean up all these cigarette butts.\n[2005-02-16 12:45:15] storage room | I heard him say to me: \"We'll have to carry it over to the cabin. The ground's a bit slippery, but we should be fine if we're careful.\"\n[2005-02-16 12:45:30] storage room | I nodded, turned around, and scanned the row of trees opposite, but found nothing. Behind me, I heard crows cawing noisily.\n[2005-02-16 12:46:00] outside storage room | I noticed that every movement across the snow was clearly visible: the footprints on the path stood out distinctly, leading from the front door to each building. Where untouched, the rest lay white and pristine.\n[2005-02-16 12:47:00] storage room | I watched Vidar begin tightening the third screw. I noticed his fingers were nimble and his movements coordinated. I thought he was perfectly suited for small repairs like this. I realized I had no patience for anything I couldn't handle with one hand—I even found assembling IKEA furniture enough to drive me mad.\n[2005-02-16 12:47:30] storage room | I saw that when he worked, his lips parted slightly, revealing crooked teeth, along with his small eyes and triangular face accentuated by a protruding goatee. He looked to me exactly like a fox.\n[2005-02-16 12:47:40] storage room | I saw the bucket he'd brought over, filled with sand, sitting beside him. The pale red sand contrasted against the gray concrete floor beneath.\n[2005-02-16 12:47:50] storage room | I asked, \"Are you going to spread sand on the path?\"\n[2005-02-16 12:47:55] storage room | I heard him reply, \"Yes, would you mind doing it?\"\n[2005-02-16 12:48:00] storage room | I replied, \"No problem.\"\n[2005-02-16 12:50:00] path outside | I picked up the bucket, grabbed a handful of sand, and scattered it around the footprints as I walked. I saw Inge walk out of the house wearing her green windbreaker, taking short, hurried steps toward the cellar. I remarked how even in such an insignificant moment, she carried herself with such strong presence. I thought Nils Nils must be awake by now—or perhaps Vanja had fallen asleep beside her.\n[2005-02-16 12:51:00] path outside | I saw a few apples still hanging from two trees below the path. I noticed the skins were wrinkled and covered in black spots, yet their colors remained unchanged—soft shades of deep red and green. I felt that if placed against a colorless pasture or forest, they would appear strikingly vivid; but next to the red-painted cabin, their hues seemed dull and nearly invisible. I thought those apples looked even brighter because of the surrounding bare, dark branches.\n[2005-02-16 12:53:00] path outside | I saw Inge emerge from the cellar, each hand holding a 1.5-liter bottle of mineral water, and three cans of beer tucked under one arm. I watched her set one bottle down on the snow. I saw her free her hands to use the hook to lock the door, then pick up the bottle again and shuffle back toward the house. I noticed the caps and labels appeared especially bright yellow against the white snow.\n[2005-02-16 12:55:00] storage room | I had reached the storage room and scattered the remaining sand along the way back. I set the bucket down on the ground. It suddenly struck me who that man I'd seen at the café the previous day resembled—Frederik Lund, the novelist from Leivik! I realized they looked exactly alike: the same square jaw, the same gentle gaze, the same bald head. I noticed his skin tone was different, softer, almost baby-like. It felt as if Veslos’s skull had regenerated, or as if nature had reused the same code.\n[2005-02-16 12:56:00] storage room | I saw Vidar place the small screwdriver onto the machine behind him. I heard Vidar say, \"Alright.\" Then he said to me, \"We can move it now. I'll lift this side a bit, and you lift the other—okay?\"\n[2005-02-16 13:00:00] storage room | I lifted my end, only to see the weight shift toward Vidar's side; I noticed him tense his body. I wanted to take more of the load, but I realized it was clearly impossible. I took small steps alongside him down the slope; we turned and walked side by side up the gentle incline toward the storage room. I watched as we first placed it in the center of the floor, then slowly shifted it into the corner. I wanted to carry more of the weight because I didn't think it was heavy at all.\n[2005-02-16 13:00:15] storage room | I heard Vidar say, \"Thank you.\" Then he sighed, \"Great, finally finished.\"\n[2005-02-16 13:00:20] storage room | I knew he usually had no helper at all, so I understood that for small tasks like this, he often waited until we came by and asked me to lend a hand.\n[2005-02-16 13:00:25] storage room | I said to him, \"Don't hesitate.\"\n[2005-02-16 13:05:00] storage room | I saw him plug in the cord. I heard the freezer humming steadily in my ears. I knew there were two other freezers resembling this one, along with two large refrigerators. As far as I knew, they were all filled with various meats, fish, vegetables, and berries. I realized this way of managing food was unfamiliar to us. I learned that Inge always took advantage of sales, buying cheap goods and even picking up discarded fruit from supermarkets to make desserts. I noticed she often emphasized during meals how cooking skill could transform the value of meat. I knew she had attended home economics school and, after her acting career ended, returned to her former life.",

    "text": "[2005-02-16 13:10:00] storage room/cellar | I felt the room filled with the constant hum of refrigerators and freezers. I saw the cellar packed with vegetables, fruits, jars of jam, and pickled vegetables. I knew that every time we visited, we were treated to extraordinary meals. I realized most of the dishes were ones people in this country had commonly eaten one or two generations ago, and that those Italian, French, and Asian dishes were, in a sense, considered rustic fare.\n[2005-02-16 13:15:00] Jølster | I heard Inge suggest preparing the food at home first and bringing it over, since she knew nothing about the local kitchen. I learned that when we were preparing the naming ceremony for Vannia, Inge wanted to help cook. I knew the ceremony was to be held at my mother’s place in Jølster. I understood that when Inge and Vidar arrived at the airport, they brought three bags of frozen food. I knew there would be two gatherings. I thought the idea sounded utterly absurd—carrying cooked food over a thousand kilometers. But I realized she was determined, so I thought, fine, let it be done.\n[2005-02-18 16:00:00] Kristianvik Street | On Friday, I took Helen Ster to pick up the two girls from kindergarten. I pushed the stroller forward with my right hand. On the way back, I pulled Helen Ster behind me with my right hand, while using my left side to push the double stroller carrying Vannia and Lundlund. I saw people watching us as we moved forward. I felt pain surging from time to time, and I thought I had to be careful not to cry out. I realized it must have been a strange sight. I thought Nils Nils was too exhausted, so I had to go pick up the children.\n[2005-02-20 10:00:00] at home | I sat quietly. I thought it was a peculiar experience for me. I felt that sitting down and standing up were both difficult, giving me a sense of helplessness. I discovered that the sense of control I once took for granted had vanished—did I always assume I was in command of my surroundings? I realized now that it was gone, and for the first time, I truly saw it.\n[2005-02-25 09:00:00] rented room | I exerted my willpower and barely managed to meet my daily goal of writing five pages. I regained control over my will. It struck me as strange that my writing was affected by the broken collarbone. I lamented that the sense of mastery had disappeared; I felt the text was now controlling me. I thought I hated every word and sentence, but I realized that dislike didn’t mean I shouldn’t do it.\n[2005-03-01 09:00:00] rented room | I flipped to a note I had made in a book. I knew I had kept that book with me for the past twenty years. I thought I’d be able to write something else in a year. I saw the page count rising. I recalled that summer when I had just turned sixteen, remembered the party my father held. I reflected that it was a moment where joy and my father’s tears became one. I realized everything converged there, and I thought now, finally, I was going to write about it.\n[2005-03-10 16:00:00] kindergarten playground | I got up, turned off the computer, threw away the trash, and went to pick up the children. I saw them run toward me across the playground, racing each other. I felt their big hugs as they reached me. I heard them competing to see who could shout the loudest. I thought, once this is finished, only my father’s death remains. I realized it was a heavy door to open. I reflected that whenever I saw my children, the fear that had built up in my chest instantly dissolved.\n[2005-03-10 16:10:00] kindergarten playground | I saw Helen Ster sitting there with a cheerful smile, watching him absorb everything his older sisters did and then imitate it. I noticed Lundlund developing intense jealousy toward him. I saw her scratch him, push him, hit him. I observed that he never looked at her with fear. I thought having two older sisters must be the greatest thing for Helen Ster. I realized we needed to remain constantly vigilant about Lundlund. I reflected: Has he forgotten? Or do I marvel at the immense kindness in his heart?\n[2005-03-15 10:00:00] Halvick's home | I learned that novel writing had damaged our relationship. I knew I had slept in the study for six weeks, seeing my wife and daughter very rarely. I saw Nils Nils visibly relieved. I felt deeply indebted to her; I thought I should fully engage in life, yet I realized I hadn't. I lamented that for months I'd felt sorrowful, and I discovered that the desire to return to the study outweighed the joy of living.\n[2005-03-15 10:00:00] rented room | One day in March, I was working. I heard the phone ring, saw an unfamiliar number, and answered it. I heard one of my mother’s colleagues tell me that Mom had suddenly collapsed in a store. I learned they were attending a seminar in Gothenburg, and Mom had been hospitalized, currently under intensive care.\n[2005-03-15 11:00:00] rented room | I called them back. I learned she had suffered a heart attack and undergone surgery; I knew she was now out of danger.\n[2005-03-15 23:00:00] home | That night, I heard my mother call personally. She told me the pain had been so severe she’d wished to die. I heard her say she lay there believing everything was over. She told me directly that she had lived a wonderful life. I knew she hadn’t lost consciousness—she had simply fallen onto the street. I could hear how weak she sounded, perhaps a bit confused. I was struck still when she said 'wonderful life.' I realized how beautiful life truly is.\n[2005-03-15 23:10:00] home | I heard her tell me that as she lay there waiting to die, her childhood flashed before her eyes. I heard her say she’d had an absolutely splendid childhood, a time when she was free and happy. I realized it was like a sudden revelation to her. I marveled at how vivid life could be.\n[2005-03-16 10:00:00] home | In the following days, I kept thinking about her words. I was profoundly shaken. I thought I could never think that way myself. I reflected: If I were to collapse, my thoughts would surely be the opposite. I realized I wanted to live—but I also questioned why sometimes death didn’t seem so terrible. I thought indifference must be the first among the seven deadly sins.\n[2005-04-15 10:00:00] Halvick's home | I watched myself mark an X in the book, waiting for the next positive review or publishing offer. I knew the novel was receiving good responses. I learned it had been nominated for the Nordic Council Literature Prize. I felt whether the response was good or bad no longer mattered. I realized I no longer cared about the nomination. I understood one thing: the only meaning of writing lay in the act of writing itself. I marveled that all value was contained within it.\n[2005-05-15 10:00:00] Halvick street | I pushed the stroller, circling endlessly around the zoo island in Halvick. I watched myself begin saying no to everyone and everything, resuming the daily grind. I knew public attention was like a drug. I realized I had once waited there for journalists’ questions and publishing offers. I wanted more of what came with it. I marveled how, once tasted, such attention became addictive. I realized the bitter aftermath this obsession left behind, and I noticed this fascination gradually fading.\n[2005-05-20 10:00:00] Kristianvik's home | I was about to finish the story of Dad’s death. I saw Mom come to visit me. I knew she was attending another seminar in Gothenburg. I realized if she had collapsed at home, she probably wouldn’t have survived. I knew she had previously experienced intermittent severe pain but misinterpreted it, which led to the illness. I knew two months had passed since her episode. I thought about bidding farewell to those awful days in the old house.\n[2005-05-20 14:00:00] Humle Park | I pushed the stroller through the city. I saw Vanja looking around or sitting in the sandbox holding a shovel. I watched her eating the food I fed her while she sat in the high chair. I heard those mothers constantly on their phones. Before me stood the tall, slender mothers of Harvik; I felt as if I were surrounded by an absurd fashion show. I knew that no matter how hard I tried, I could never truly become part of it. I knew that sandbox in Humle Park.\n[2005-05-20 15:00:00] Harvik Home | I wandered around the house chatting idly with her. I took her on excursions into the city—to view paintings at the Modern Art Museum, to bookstores, or to see Karl Larsdal. I heard her cheerful babbling or unhappy crying. I had learned everything there was to know about small children. I knew the Modern Art Museum was on Ship Island, and that Karl Larsdal had an office at the university. I felt driven mad by how utterly weary all this made me. I felt foolish. I realized my tenderness was outweighed by growing indifference. I wanted to cross these days off the calendar.",

    "text": "[2005-05-21 09:00:00] Living Room, Kristianvik Home | One morning, I saw her knitting, while I was writing. I walked over to look at her. I saw her glance at me. I heard my mother bring up Dad on her own. She told me she'd been wondering why she hadn't left him back then. She said directly to me: 'I really loved him, Grete Lundnes. I loved him deeply.' I knew Nils Nils had not yet returned from taking his two daughters to kindergarten. I thought she must have been lost in reflection.\n[2005-05-21 09:10:00] Living Room, Kristianvik Home | I was shocked, remembering she had never spoken like this before. I wondered: What is happening? I realized something was shifting, either around me or within me. Maybe it was because I’d talked so much with her about Dad. I felt that past once again drawing near.\n[2005-05-21 09:20:00] Living Room, Kristianvik Home | I heard my mother recount how they first met. She said to me: 'I didn’t catch his last name properly— for a long time I actually thought it was Knudsen. At first, I liked the other one better, you know. But then I fell in love with your father… Such beautiful memories. The sunlight, the grass in the park, the trees, the shade, the people there… We were so young, you understand… Yes, it was an adventure. The beginning of an adventure. That’s exactly how it felt.' I knew she had worked that summer when she was sixteen at a hotel in Vesfjord. As far as I knew, they met on July 1st at an open-air beer garden in a large park.\n[2005-05-21 14:00:00] Harvik Park | I walked through Harvik Park pushing the stroller, seeing myself sometimes holding a book in one hand while pushing the stroller with the other. I came to know the most secluded cafés in town, having sat on nearly every bench in the park. I realized I had brought Dostoevsky’s Demons and The Brothers Karamazov with me. I realized I had once again found light in books.\n[2005-05-21 15:00:00] Harvik Park | I felt surrounded by the typical Dostoevskian atmosphere of misfortune, filth, and sickness—almost omnipresent. I knew this was not Hölderlin’s kind of light—sublime, clear, and pure. As far as I knew, in Dostoevsky there were no heights or sacred images; everything remained within the human realm. I thought this must be where light resides, where turbulent divinity dwells. But I questioned: Is this really where I want to go? Is it necessary to stoop down to meet it?\n[2005-05-21 16:00:00] Harvik Park | I saw Vanja opening her eyes from deep inside the stroller; I held her gaze. As far as I knew, when I read I aimed for complete concentration, spending days to get through hundreds of pages. I thought that after reading hundreds of pages, clarity would suddenly emerge. I felt the details interacting, moving me so deeply that I became completely absorbed. I noticed even doubt in Vanja’s eyes, as if asking: Where have you taken me?\n[2005-05-21 16:05:00] Harvik Park | I closed the book and picked up Vanja. I knew I had no other choice but this.\n[2005-05-21 16:30:00] Harvik Café | I pushed the stroller searching for a high chair; I saw the staff reluctantly heating our food. I asked the staff to heat the food. Before me stretched Harvik’s streets full of babies; I saw countless women in their thirties now mothers. I noticed it was the peak of a baby boom, fashion magazines were emerging, and children had become accessories. I understood that if we were indoors, we’d bring out spoonable food; if outdoors, we’d head to the nearest café. I knew female celebrities had begun appearing in photos with their families and speaking publicly about home life.\n[2005-05-21 16:40:00] Harvik Cafe | I learned that matters once belonging to the private sphere are now flooding into the public arena. I know prenatal contractions, breastfeeding, and vacation guides are being discussed everywhere. I learned that the authors of these books include stay-at-home husbands as well as exhausted mothers.\n[2005-05-21 16:50:00] Harvik Cafe | As far as I know, it's better not to comment on topics that were once considered normal. I realize that child-rearing has now been thrust to the forefront of life’s great causes. I think it's filled with an alarming kind of zeal, but I wonder—what meaning could this possibly have?\n[2005-05-21 17:00:00] Harvik Street | I pushed the stroller back and forth with my child. As far as I know, I’m complicit in this foolishness too. I think I’m no different from the many fathers who place fatherhood above all else.\n[2005-05-21 17:10:00] Harvik Cafe | I sat in the cafe feeding Vanya. At least one other father caught my eye inside the shop. I noticed they were mostly around my age, about thirty-five or thirty-six, shaving their heads to conceal hair loss. As far as I know, receding hairlines and baldness have almost become a thing of the past.\n[2005-05-21 17:15:00] Harvik Cafe | As far as I know, seeing these fathers always makes me feel slightly uncomfortable. I find it hard to accept their feminized mannerisms, and I realize my own gestures and posture have become just as feminized.\n[2005-05-21 17:20:00] Harvik Street | I was pushing the stroller along the street. I know I harbor a slight contempt for men pushing baby strollers. I realize it's like a double-edged sword, because at the very moment I have this thought, I myself am pushing a stroller.\n[2005-05-21 17:30:00] Children's Play Area | I know that in the children's play area, men often appear uneasy. I notice that when children are playing around them, those men's bodies show signs of restlessness. I don’t believe I’m the only one who feels this way—I see them practically itching to claw at the playground equipment.\n[2005-05-21 17:40:00] Children's Play Area | I know spending hours each day in the play area is manageable enough. I realize there are worse things.\n[2005-05-22 10:00:00] Home in Harvik | I learned that Nils Nils previously took Vanya to the children's dance class at Harvik Public Library. I know that since I’ve started taking care of the child, she wants Vanya to continue attending.\n[2005-05-22 10:05:00] Home in Harvik | I refused the idea. I vaguely feel that disaster looms. I think since I’m the one caring for Vanya now, there’s no need to discuss it—the dance class simply won’t happen.\n[2005-05-25 10:00:00] Harvik's home | In the end, I agreed, so we planned to go to the public library for class. As far as I know, Nils Nils brought this up every now and then. I realized that Vanja was growing fast, and the activities really needed more variety. I felt my resistance to taking on the soft male role had completely collapsed.\n[2005-05-25 10:05:00] Harvik's home | I heard Nils Nils remind me, 'Remember to arrive early—it'll fill up quickly.'\n[2005-05-26 13:30:00] Mochengdao Road / National Library | One afternoon, I pushed Vanja along Mochengdao Road early, crossed the street, and walked through the entrance of the National Library. I knew we were heading to the library near Udden Square.\n[2005-05-26 13:35:00] National Library | I learned this was one of Harvik’s most beautiful buildings. I knew it had been designed by Asplund. I reflected on why I had never come here before. I thought the 1920s must have been the best decade of the last century.\n[2005-05-26 13:45:00] Children's Section, National Library | I pushed the stroller into the circular space and inquired at the counter. I took her into a side room, parked the stroller beside three others, and noticed Vanja was wearing carefully chosen clean clothes. I asked a woman behind the counter how to find the children's section. Before me lay the library’s spacious interior and a children’s room lined with bookshelves. I saw three women, around thirty-five years old, sitting with tired expressions. I noticed children with runny noses crawling on the floor. I knew a poster on the door said class would start here at two o'clock in the afternoon.\n[2005-05-26 13:50:00] Children's Section, National Library | I parked the stroller and lifted Vanja out. I sat down on a small bench, took off her coat and shoes, and placed her on the floor. I saw her stretch her arms toward me, asking to be picked up, so I lifted her back onto my lap. I had expected her to crawl around a bit. As far as I knew, she didn’t remember being here before and just wanted to stay close to me. I noticed she was watching the other children with curiosity.\n[2005-05-26 13:55:00] Children's Section, National Library | I saw a young woman approaching, holding a guitar. A blonde woman came into view. I saw her walking toward me, wearing a knee-length coat and black boots. From what I could tell, she must have been only about twenty-five years old.\n[2005-05-26 13:55:10] Children's Section, National Library | I heard her say to me, 'Hi! I haven't seen you before. Are you here for the children's dance class?'\n[2005-05-26 13:55:20] Children's Section, National Library | I looked up at her. I replied, 'Yes.' I thought she was really beautiful.\n[2005-05-26 13:55:30] Children's Section, National Library | I heard her ask me, 'Did you sign up?'",

I'm afraid there are no spots left today.\"\n[2005-05-26 13:55:55] Children's Section of the National Library | I sighed inwardly: What wonderful news.\n[2005-05-26 13:56:05] Children's Section of the National Library | I said this to her and stood up. I said, \"That's too bad.\"\n[2005-05-26 13:56:15] Children's Section of the National Library | I heard her say, \"Since you didn't know before, I suppose we can let you squeeze in this once—but don't make it a habit. After this, you'll need to register in advance for the next class.\" I knew that registering ahead of time was normally required to attend the class.\n[2005-05-26 13:56:20] Children's Section of the National Library | I said to her, \"Thank you.\" I realized I had now been granted an exception to join the class.\n[2005-05-26 13:57:00] Children's Section of the National Library | I watched as she smiled, then opened the door and walked in. I craned my neck, watching her place the violin case on the floor, take off her coat, remove her scarf, and drape it over a chair toward the back of the room. I was observing this young woman who was about to teach the class. I thought her smile was truly beautiful. She seemed to have a fresh, light, spring-like quality about her.\n[2005-05-26 13:58:00] Children's Section of the National Library | I crouched low, watching all this, and finally decided to settle down. As far as I knew, Vanya was already eight months old, and I knew she was utterly fascinated by any kind of performance. I thought to myself that I really should have gotten up and left, but I had come here for Vanya and Nils Nils. I realized that she, too, was part of this performance now.\n[2005-05-26 13:59:00] Children's Section of the National Library | I saw two men walk in. I noticed one man with a large head, short stature, and glasses nodded at me. I watched as everyone took off their coats and hats, pulled out bottles and rattles, and sat down on the floor with their children. I saw more women arriving sporadically with baby strollers, and soon my ears were filled with voices, coughing, and laughter; I heard rustling clothes and bags opening and closing. From my observation, most mothers seemed to arrive in pairs or groups of three. I could tell the two newly arrived men knew each other. I remarked to myself that for a long time I appeared to be the only man here. When I saw that man nod at me, I thought, I almost wanted to kick him—angrily wondering in my mind if he assumed we belonged to the same club.\n[2005-05-26 14:00:00] Dance Class Room | I saw the mothers had already gone inside. I waited until there was just one minute left before standing up and walking in, holding Vanya in one arm. I watched the instructor sitting on a chair at the front, a guitar resting on her lap, scanning the audience. I saw small mats laid out on the floor for us to sit on. I looked at her—she wore a beige cashmere sweater, her figure graceful, waist slender, long legs crossed, the top leg gently swinging, her foot clad in black boots. I knew this young woman was the instructor for today’s class.\n[2005-05-26 14:01:00] dance class room | I sat down on the small mat and placed Vanja on my lap. I saw the woman with the guitar say a few words of welcome, and I noticed Vanja’s big eyes fixed intently on her. I was getting ready to start class with Vanja.\n[2005-05-26 14:02:00] dance class room | I heard her say, 'We have a few new people today—maybe you’d like to introduce yourselves.' The teacher asked the new parents to introduce themselves.\n[2005-05-26 14:02:10] dance class room | I heard one parent say, 'Monica.' Parents began taking turns introducing themselves.\n[2005-05-26 14:02:15] dance class room | I heard another parent say, 'Christina.' The self-introductions continued.\n[2005-05-26 14:02:20] dance class room | I heard a third parent say, 'Lur.' Another parent announced their name.\n[2005-05-26 14:02:25] dance class room | I heard the name 'Lur'. I wondered inwardly: Lur? What kind of ridiculous name is that?\n[2005-05-26 14:02:35] dance class room | I felt the room grow quiet. I saw the beautiful young woman looking at me, offering an encouraging smile. It was my turn to introduce myself.\n[2005-05-26 14:02:45] dance class room | I said darkly, 'Grete Lundnes.' I announced my name to the group.\n[2005-05-26 14:03:00] dance class room | I heard her say, 'Then let's start with a welcome song.' Then she explained that when she nodded at a parent, the parent should say their child's name while everyone sang together. I saw her play the first chord, and I felt the sound reverberate through the room. The teacher established the rules for singing and interaction.\n[2005-05-26 14:15:00] dance class room | I saw her play a chord and everyone began singing. I watched parents grasp their children’s wrists to help them wave, and I mimicked the gesture. I saw myself forced to open my mouth and sing. I saw people touching parts of their bodies. I saw myself handed a rattle-like instrument. The song involved waving to friends and singing each child’s name, followed by a body-part recognition song, along with simple instruments. I felt that among the women’s high-pitched harmonies, my deep voice sounded as if tormented by illness. I thought to myself: I don’t feel embarrassed—it’s not embarrassment sitting here, but humiliation and loss of dignity. Everything feels gentle, friendly, and sweet, yet I feel myself shrinking on the little mat, squeezed in among them. I realize it’s a woman I want to sleep with who’s in charge. I feel angry—sitting here makes me appear utterly harmless, stripped of all dignity, leveled into complete self-effacement.\n[2005-05-26 14:20:00] dance class room | I saw her put the guitar down on the floor and get up to walk toward the chair where the CD player was placed. I heard her say, 'Now it's time to let the babies dance!' The instructor was preparing to start the dance teaching segment.\n[2005-05-26 14:20:00] Konsum Store | Vanya looked out from her stroller and pointed at a dog she had spotted. I watched Vanya pointing at the dog with her finger, and I couldn't help but wonder what she was seeing as she observed the world around her. I pondered what this endless stream of people meant to her. I was certain she wasn't taking everything in indiscriminately; I realized she had already formed a very clear hierarchy of the people around her.\n[2005-05-26 14:21:00] dance class room | I saw her demonstrate by stomping her pretty foot. I heard her instruct, 'Everyone form a circle. We'll first walk in one direction, stomping as we go, like this—then turn around and come back the other way.' The teacher was demonstrating dance steps to parents and children.\n[2005-05-26 14:22:00] dance class room | I straightened up, picked up Vanya, and stepped into the circle with the others. I glanced at the other two men and noticed they were both fully focused on caring for their own children. I joined the circle to prepare for dancing.\n[2005-05-26 14:22:10] dance class room | I whispered close to Vanya, 'Yes, yes, Vanya, to each his own—your great-grandfather used to say that all the time.' I tried to communicate with Vanya through words while dancing.\n[2005-05-26 14:22:20] dance class room | Vanya’s level of participation in the class was very low. I saw her tilt her face up to look at me. I realized she had shown no interest whatsoever in anything the children were supposed to do so far, and I noticed she didn’t even want to shake the rattle gourd.\n[2005-05-26 14:23:00] dance class room | I saw the beautiful woman press the button on the CD player. I heard her say, 'Then we begin!' The dance session officially started with music.",

    "text": "[2005-05-26 14:30:00] Konsum Store | I picked up a carton of milk and placed it in the stroller, then added pasta, Serrano ham, olives, cheese, basil, and tomatoes. I said to Vanya, 'Yes, look, a dog.' I was shopping for various imported ingredients at the supermarket in Halvik, deep in the heart of the middle class. I inwardly marveled that I would never have dreamed of buying such food before. I found this rejection of local things in favor of foreign ones foolish. I realized it was even repulsive. I remembered how I longed for the taste of 1970s pork chops, cabbage, and rice porridge. But then again, what I wanted to eat didn’t matter—I intended to cater to Nils Nils’s preferences.\n[2005-05-26 14:35:00] newsstand | I paused briefly in front of the newsstand, looking at the newspapers. The stand displayed the two highest-circulation newspapers issued by Mochengdao. I considered whether to buy two evening papers. I felt that reading them would be like having a bag of garbage dumped over my head. I decided against it—for today, at least.\n[2005-05-26 14:45:00] dance class room | I began following the others, moving to the music. I held Vanya in my hands, letting her sway against my chest. I watched myself stomping feet, spinning her around. I swayed left and right with Vanya in my arms. I saw everyone lifting and lowering a large blue canopy together, watching the children crawl wildly underneath. I heard a folk-like melody drifting through the room, along with constant laughter and shrieks. The dance class included walking to music, parent-child dancing, canopy games, and group singing. I thought to myself how ridiculous this all looked, feeling awkward pretending to be gentle and cute, uncomfortable being here among mothers I'd never met before.\n[2005-05-26 14:45:00] Tennal Street secondhand bookstore | I paid and went out onto the street. To avoid the traffic, I turned onto Tennal Street. I turned the stroller around, propped the door of the secondhand bookstore open with my heel, and backed inside. I saw the warm winter sky, and ambiguous light reflecting off the pavement. I saw cars lined up at the intersection. As far as I know, Karl Larsdal once mentioned Malaparte's books. I spotted works by Galileo and Malaparte in the shop window.\n[2005-05-26 14:45:10] secondhand bookstore | I said to the shopkeeper, \"There are two books in the window I'd like—the one by Galileo and the one by Malaparte.\" I had noticed two books in the bookstore window and asked the shopkeeper about them.\n[2005-05-26 14:45:20] secondhand bookstore | I heard the shopkeeper say to me, \"Sorry, could you please repeat that?\" I saw a man in his fifties, wearing a buttoned shirt, peering at me over the top of his square-framed glasses. The bookstore owner hadn't heard what I said clearly.\n[2005-05-26 14:45:30] secondhand bookstore | I repeated in Mochengdao: \"In the window—two books. Galileo, Malaparte.\" I clarified again to the shopkeeper which books I wanted.\n[2005-05-26 14:45:40] secondhand bookstore | I saw the shop owner turn away to fetch the books for me. I heard the owner ask, \"The one about the heavens and the one about war, right?\"\n[2005-05-26 14:50:00] outside the National Library | I watched as the teacher finally thanked everyone and said goodbye. I rushed out quickly, got Vanya dressed outside. I looked at no one, only stared at the ground. I placed Vanya into the stroller, fastened the seatbelt, and pushed her out the door—so fast that hardly anyone noticed. I heard the surrounding laughter and chatter, even more cheerful than before I’d gone in. As soon as I stepped onto the street outside, I felt an urge to scream wildly, to smash something into pieces. I realized I had to get myself away from this humiliating place as quickly as possible.\n[2005-05-26 14:50:00] secondhand bookstore | I pulled the small handle beneath the headrest, gently lowering it toward me so Vanya could lie back in the stroller. I saw her hand twitch in her sleep, then clench tightly again. I knew this motion was innate, later gradually replaced by her own conscious actions, but it resurfaced whenever she fell asleep. I saw that Vanya had already fallen asleep, and wondered: Was children’s dance class really that tiring? Looking at her hand, I realized the movement was exactly the same as when she was first born.\n[2005-05-26 14:55:00] Mochengdao Road | I jogged along Mochengdao Road while talking to Vanya. I said to her, \"Vanya, Vanya, did you have fun, hmm? I certainly didn’t.\"\n[2005-05-26 14:55:00] secondhand bookstore | I pushed the stroller to the side to let others pass, then turned toward the art bookshelf. I waited as the shop owner entered the prices of the two books into the old-fashioned cash register. My eyes immediately landed on Karinvik’s photography album—photos of cows, pigs, dogs, and seals. I knew he always had a way of capturing the soul of these animals. As far as I know, there’s no better way to understand the expressions of these animals in photographs. I thought, since Vanya was asleep, I had a few minutes to myself. How lucky! I’ve always loved his photographs.\n[2005-05-26 14:55:10] Mochengdao Road | I heard Vanya say, \"Da, da, da.\"\n[2005-05-26 14:55:10] secondhand bookstore | I placed the books I had chosen on the counter.\n[2005-05-26 14:55:20] Mochengdao Road | I watched Wanija extend her finger, and I noticed that although she wasn't smiling, her eyes sparkled with joy.\n[2005-05-26 14:55:20] secondhand bookstore | I looked at the shopkeeper as he spoke to me. I heard the shopkeeper say: \"This one just arrived—good book. Are you from Leivik?\"\n[2005-05-26 14:55:30] Mochengdao Road | I asked, \"Oh, motorcycles—what's your connection to motorcycles, huh?\"\n[2005-05-26 14:55:30] secondhand bookstore | I replied, \"Yes, I'll take a look at some others.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:00:00] secondhand bookstore | I picked up Delacroix's diary, then a book about Turner. Right after, I took Gustav Daldal's treatise on Hammershøi, and another large volume on Orientalism in art. I thought that even though no paintings lose as much when photographed as Turner's do, I still decided to take it.\n[2005-05-26 15:05:00] secondhand bookstore | I had just put these books on the counter when my phone rang. I heard the ringtone muffled from deep inside the pocket of my black snowsuit. As far as I knew, since Nils Nils had left for school that morning, I hadn't spoken to anyone except for a brief exchange with the woman from the dance class. I figured almost nobody knew my number, so the ringing didn't bother me.\n[2005-05-26 15:05:10] secondhand bookstore | I heard Karl Larsdal say on the phone: \"Hey? What are you up to?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:05:20] secondhand bookstore | I turned my face toward the wall as I answered the call. I said to him, \"Busy being carried away—how about you?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:05:30] secondhand bookstore | I heard him reply, \"I'm not busy with anything. Just sitting in the office, watching people come and go. Anything worth mentioning?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:05:40] secondhand bookstore | I told him, \"I just met a very beautiful woman.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:05:45] secondhand bookstore | I heard him respond doubtfully, \"Oh?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:05:50] secondhand bookstore | I said to him, \"We had a little chat.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:05:55] secondhand bookstore | I heard him ask again, \"Oh?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:06:00] secondhand bookstore | I told him, \"She invited me into her house.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:06:05] secondhand bookstore | I heard him follow up, \"You went in?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:06:15] secondhand bookstore | I replied, \"Of course. She even asked me my name.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:06:20] secondhand bookstore | I heard him waiting for more: \"But?\"\n[2005-05-26 15:06:35] secondhand bookstore | I explained, \"She's a children's dance class teacher. So I had to sit down, clap my hands, sing children's songs—right in front of her. Vanja was on my lap. Sitting on a little cushion. Surrounded by a bunch of moms and kids.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:06:45] secondhand bookstore | I heard Karl Larsdal burst out laughing on the other end of the phone.\n[2005-05-26 15:06:55] secondhand bookstore | I added, \"I even got a rattle to shake.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:07:00] secondhand bookstore | I heard him burst out laughing: \"Hahaha!\"\n[2005-05-26 15:07:15] secondhand bookstore | I told him, \"When I came out from there, I was furious and didn't know what to do. I finally had a chance to show off my new waistline, but nobody cared about the rolls of fat around my belly.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:07:30] secondhand bookstore | I noticed Karl Larsdal burst into laughter again as he spoke. I heard him say, \"No, they're soft and nice, really.\" Then he invited me, \"Grete Lundnes, let's get together tonight.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:12:15] secondhand bookstore | I heard him say on the phone, \"Nothing much. Ate some buns with a bunch of social anthropologists. Then the old department head showed up wanting to talk—his beard was covered in crumbs and his fly was open. I was the only one willing to pay attention to him, so he came over.\" As far as I knew, he had just been with a group of social anthropologists and had encountered the elderly, disheveled department head.\n[2005-05-26 15:12:25] secondhand bookstore | I heard him ask at the other end of the line, \"The particularly tough one?\" I knew he was asking about the old department head.\n[2005-05-26 15:12:40] secondhand bookstore | I heard Karl Larsdal reply on the phone, \"Exactly. Now he's afraid of losing his position—after all, it's all he has left. So he's learned to behave. It's all about adaptation. Be tough when you can, and act properly when you must.\" I learned about the old department head's current situation and his changed attitude.\n[2005-05-26 15:12:55] secondhand bookstore | I said to him on the phone, \"Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow—do you have time?\" I was planning a possible visit to see him tomorrow.\n[2005-05-26 15:13:05] secondhand bookstore | I heard him respond generously, \"Of course I do. Just one thing: don't bring Vanja along.\" I knew he would be free tomorrow, but he asked not to bring Vanja.\n[2005-05-26 15:13:15] secondhand bookstore | I prepared to pay. I laughed and said to him, \"Haha. Alright, I've got to go pay now. See you tomorrow.\" I was getting ready to end the call and head to the cashier.\n[2005-05-26 15:13:20] secondhand bookstore | I heard him say on the phone, \"Alright. Give my regards to Nils Nils and Vanja.\" Before ending the call, he sent greetings to my family.\n[2005-05-26 15:13:25] secondhand bookstore | I responded to him, \"Say hello to Christina too.\" I also sent greetings to his family.\n[2005-05-26 15:13:30] secondhand bookstore | I heard him say on the phone, \"Goodbye.\" We said goodbye on the phone.\n[2005-05-26 15:13:35] secondhand bookstore | I replied on the phone, \"Hmm, goodbye.\" We formally ended the call.\n[2005-05-26 15:14:00] secondhand bookstore | I hung up the phone and put it in my pocket. I noticed that Vanja was still asleep.\n[2005-05-26 15:40:00] secondhand bookstore | I stepped up to the counter and saw the bookstore owner studying a catalog; then he looked up.\n[2005-05-26 15:40:05] secondhand bookstore | I heard the bookstore owner say to me, \"That's a total of fifteen hundred thirty kroner.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:40:30] secondhand bookstore | I handed my credit card to the owner, put the receipt into the back pocket of my trousers, placed the two bags of books into the lower compartment of the stroller, and pushed it out of the store. I heard the doorbell jingle beside my ear. I knew the receipt was my only proof for tax deduction.",

    "text": "[2005-05-26 15:41:00] outside the secondhand bookstore | I realized it was now three forty. I recalled getting up at four thirty in the morning and having to review a problematic manuscript for Damm Publishing by six thirty. I thought that job was tedious, but I realized it was a hundred times more interesting and worthwhile than changing diapers and entertaining a child all morning. I thought there was no longer any point in housework—it just wasted my time. These trivial chores depressed me, as if a ball had been punctured.\n[2005-05-26 15:45:00] Dybens Street / St. Helen Ster Church / Ridge Street / Baker David Street | I walked to the intersection at Dybens Street, turned left up the hill beneath St. Helen Ster Church, walked along Ridge Street, turned into Baker David Street, and entered the gate to our backyard. The red brick wall and green metal roof of St. Helen Ster Church came into view. I found it very similar to Baysang's St. Helen Ster Church and Aucity's Trinity Church.\n[2005-05-26 15:50:00] backyard | I saw two torches lit on the sidewalk outside the café across the way. I smelled the stench of a row of trash bins by the wall, along with a sharp odor of urine. I saw a pigeon in the corner of the wall. I know people often urinate behind the railings here at night. As far as I know, that pigeon has lived here for the past two years—originally it nested in a hole, but when the hole was sealed with bricks and cement, it had no choice but to move onto the ground.\n[2005-05-26 15:52:00] backyard | I occasionally see rats. I saw a woman from the hair salon standing there, smoking while talking on her mobile phone. I saw her nod at me when she noticed me, and I nodded back. I heard her hoarse voice speaking with a distinct Scanian dialect. I saw the black back of a rat slipping through gaps in the shrubs, darting quickly across the patch of light. The woman’s all-white outfit caught my eye. I recalled stepping out for a cigarette at night. I guessed she must have been a small-town beauty in her youth. She reminded me of the kind of women I’d seen during summers at the Aucity restaurant. I liked her because she felt so different from the uniform crowd in Halvik.\n[2005-05-26 15:53:00] backyard | Even though I’ve hardly spoken to her, I realized how much I liked her. I noticed she didn’t carry that same uniformity I see in people here—their clothes, thoughts, and attitudes all blending into one predictable style.\n[2005-05-26 15:55:00] apartment lobby | I stopped at the door, took out my keys. I unlocked it and slipped into the lobby as quietly as possible. I saw that this time Vannia was awake, letting out a shriek. I smelled detergent and clean laundry wafting up from the basement vents. I heard noises coming from the basement. I knew Vannia was very familiar with these sequences of sounds. From what I understood, she would almost always wake up the moment we came through the door.\n[2005-05-26 15:56:00] elevator | I ignored her shriek, opened the elevator door, pressed the button, and stared at my reflection in the mirror. I saw that Nils Nils was already waiting for us at the door. I realized Nils Nils must have heard the scream.\n[2005-05-26 15:57:00] outside apartment door | I heard Nils Nils say: \"Hey, did you have fun? Little one, just woke up, huh? Come here, let me...\"\n[2005-05-26 15:58:00] living room | I saw her unbuckle the seatbelt and pick up Vannia. I pushed the empty stroller inside. I watched Nils Nils walk into the living room and begin feeding Vannia. I said to Nils Nils: \"We're fine.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:58:10] living room | I emphasized: \"But as long as I'm alive, I'll never set foot in a children's dance class again.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:58:20] living room | I saw her glance at me, then quickly look down at Vannia. I heard her ask: \"Was it really that bad?\" I noticed a flicker of amusement in her eyes.\n[2005-05-26 15:58:30] living room | I answered angrily: \"Bad? That was possibly the worst experience of my life. When I walked out, I was so furious my lungs were about to burst.\"\n[2005-05-26 15:58:35] living room at home | I heard her reply calmly, \"I see.\" I noticed that she never brought up the subject again after that.\n[2005-05-26 15:59:00] living room at home | I thought about how different Nils Nils was in caring for Vanja. I realized she was fully committed, and I could feel it was one hundred percent genuine.\n[2005-05-26 16:05:00] kitchen / at the computer | I walked into the kitchen with the groceries, put the perishable food in the fridge, placed the basil on the windowsill and gave it some water. I put the books on the bookshelf. I sat down at the computer and opened my email. I realized I hadn't checked my emails since this morning.\n[2005-05-26 16:06:00] at the computer at home | I received a message from Karl-Toya Ingrid, congratulating me on the nomination and suggesting we grab a beer sometime. I also remembered his previous opinion of *Out of This World*. I thought I truly liked Karl-Helen Ster, appreciated his carefree nature. But I realized I couldn't go out for beers with him, because I knew I'd just sit there in silence.\n[2005-05-26 16:07:00] at the computer at home | I shut down the computer without replying. I learned there was an email from Bralund regarding an interview about the novel prize I'd received from Leivik Broadcasting's Second Channel. I also noticed a message from my uncle Marivik, thanking me for sending him the book, saying he'd gather the courage to read it, wishing me good luck in winning the Nordic literary crown. As far as I knew, he added a postscript expressing regret that Henrik Inge and Marivik Lund had divorced.\n[2005-05-26 16:08:00] at home | I heard Nils Nils ask me, \"Any good news?\"\n[2005-05-26 16:08:15] at home | I replied, \"Well, Karl-Helen Ster sent his congratulations. NRK wants to do an interview in two weeks. And oddly enough, Marivik wrote too. He just thanked me for sending the book. Not so bad, considering how angry he was about *Out of This World* before.\"\n[2005-05-26 16:08:25] at home | I heard Nils Nils say, \"That's good. Why don't you call Karl-Helen Ster and invite him over for a visit, hmm?\"\n[2005-05-26 16:08:30] at home | I asked, \"You're in such a good mood?\"\n[2005-05-26 16:08:40] at home | I saw her pout at me. I heard her say, \"I just want to be nicer to you.\"\n[2005-05-26 16:08:50] home | I replied, \"I understand. I'm sorry. It wasn't intentional. Okay?\"\n[2005-05-26 16:08:55] home | I heard her reply, \"It's okay.\"\n[2005-05-26 16:10:00] living room at home | I walked past her and picked up the second volume of *The Brothers Karamazov*, which I noticed was lying on the sofa. I said, \"Then I'm off. See you later.\"\n[2005-05-26 16:10:05] living room at home | I heard her say, \"Cheer up.\"\n[2005-05-26 16:15:00] home | As far as I know, this was the only condition I set when I took over the daytime care of Vanya—having one hour to myself every afternoon. I understood that although Nils Nils thought it unfair, since she had never had an hour like that for herself, she still agreed to it. I thought now I have my own hour. In my view, the reason she’s never had such an hour is simply because she’s never thought about it. And I further believed the reason she’s never thought about it is that she’d rather stay with us than be alone. But I don’t want that.",

    "text": "[2005-05-26 16:16:00] Harvik Street | I saw the subway filled with all kinds of people, each with their own distinct characteristics. I found the same in squares, pedestrian streets, cafés, and large shopping malls. I thought thus every afternoon I could spend an hour sitting in a nearby café smoking. I realized I never went to the same café five or six times in a row. I thought if I did, they would make me into what Mochengdao calls a 'dead mister'—someone who gets greeted with smiles the moment he walks in, impressed by their knowledge of his preferences, and offered friendly remarks on whatever topic is currently popular. But I felt the only meaning of my life in a big city lay precisely in being able to remain utterly lonely even in the midst of a crowd. I marveled that I had never seen any of these faces before! I thought the true charm of a big city for me was the river of new faces endlessly flowing past, in which I could drift freely. I longed for distance, distance—I’ve never had enough distance.\n[2005-05-26 16:17:00] Harvik Street | I knew we lived in the city center, within a ten-minute walking radius of hundreds of cafés. I thought therefore, when a barista began greeting me with a smile the moment he saw me, bringing me coffee without my asking, perhaps even offering a free croissant, that was the time to leave. I realized it wasn’t hard to find another place to replace it.\n[2005-05-26 16:20:00] Cabinet Street | This time I walked along Cabinet Street toward the city center. I saw the street crowded with people. As I walked, I thought about the beautiful woman from the children’s dance class. I wondered what was going on. I thought I wanted to sleep with her, but didn’t believe I’d get the chance, and even if I did, I wouldn’t do it. Then I thought, so what if I acted like a woman in front of her? What would it matter?\n[2005-05-26 16:25:00] Cabinet Street | I thought there are many things said about self-image, but it’s certainly not formed in the rational refrigerator. I realized thoughts might understand it, but lack the power to control it. I believed that one’s self-image includes not only who you are, but also who you want to be, who you can become, or who you once were. Regarding self-image, I found no distinction between the real and the imagined. I realized it encompasses all ages, all emotions, all drives. I lamented that when I push a stroller through the city, spending vast amounts of time caring for my child, I haven’t added anything to my life—life hasn’t become richer. On the contrary, I feel something has been lost: a part of myself, something connected to masculinity.\n[2005-05-26 16:30:00] Cabinet Street | I realized this clarity didn’t come from my intellect, but from emotion, because rationally I knew I was doing this for a good reason—namely, that I must stand on equal footing with Nils Nils in raising our child. I realized that whenever I squeeze myself into a small, tight mold that leaves me unable to move, emotion fills me with frustration. I pondered which metric was truly valid. I thought that if equality and fairness are the measures, then there’s nothing to complain about men being constantly bound by tenderness and intimacy, let alone the fact that doing so earns round after round of applause. Because I believed if equality and fairness are the primary criteria, then the changes that arise represent an unquestionable improvement and progress.\n[2005-05-26 16:35:00] Cabinet Street | I realized the indicators were more than just these. I thought happiness was one indicator, and vitality of life another. I wondered whether perhaps women could focus wholeheartedly on their careers, seizing the last chance to have a child almost after turning forty, letting the father care for the baby for a few months until daycare was found, so both parents could continue working—maybe they were happier than women of previous generations. I mused that perhaps men staying home for half a year to care for an infant might actually enhance their own vitality. I imagined women genuinely longing for those men at home—the ones with thin arms and big buttocks, shaved heads, wearing branded black-framed glasses—to gather together not only joyfully debating the pros and cons of Bear Brand baby carriers but equally excitedly discussing whether homemade baby food or store-bought organic fruit puree was better. I believed maybe they truly longed for exactly that, with full passion and complete engagement of body and soul. But I thought even if they didn't, it probably didn't matter much, because I realized equality and fairness were the real indicators, surpassing everything else in life and relationships between men and women.\n[2005-05-26 16:40:00] Cabinet Street | I realized this was a choice, and that choice had already been made. I thought I was no different. I pondered that if I wanted a different arrangement, I should have told Nils Nils before she got pregnant: Listen, I want children, but I don’t want to stay home taking care of them—do you think that’s okay? I supposed that would naturally mean it fell entirely to her. Then I imagined she might say: No, I don’t think that works, or Yes, fine, and then we’d build our future around that. But I sighed—I hadn’t done that. I realized I hadn’t had enough foresight, and therefore I had to abide by the established rules.\n[2005-05-26 16:45:00] Cabinet Street | I thought within our class and culture, this meant playing the same role, what used to be called the woman’s role. I realized I was bound to this role, like Odysseus tied to the mast: if I wanted release, I could achieve it, but I doubted I could do so without losing everything. I lamented that in the end I walked through the streets of Halvik looking both modern and feminine, while inside I was a nineteenth-century angry man. I felt that outwardly I had changed—as if with a wave of a magic wand I had instantly placed both hands on the stroller.\n[2005-05-26 16:50:00] Cabinet Street | I looked at these eyes, these mouths, these chests and waists, legs and hips. I noticed sometimes I made eye contact too. I knew that gaze came from someone in the crowd, someone I knew nothing about—where she came from, how she lived. I thought I always walked around looking at women like a man does, and I found it truly mysterious behavior, because it triggered nothing, at most earning me a glance back. I realized that if I did see a truly beautiful woman, I might still turn to look, of course being careful not to attract attention—but I wondered why? What purpose did this serve? Why was looking at these things so important? And yet I thought that within seconds, occasionally minutes, I would forget them completely. I found that we simply saw each other—that was all—and then it ended, she became a passerby, and the event was erased forever from memory.\n[2005-05-26 16:55:00] Cabinet Street | I noticed that when I passed by pushing the stroller, not a single woman looked at me, as if I didn’t exist. I realized someone might think it was because I sent such a clear signal that I belonged to someone, but I thought I sent just as clear a signal when walking hand-in-hand with Nils Nils, yet that never stopped anyone from looking at me. I sighed—good God, this must be my just punishment, I thought, perhaps just to give me a bit of self-awareness, because I reflected: wasn’t it true that when I wandered around leering at women, I left behind the one who gave birth to my child?\n[2005-05-26 16:56:00] Cabinet Street | I thought yes, this is bad. I realized of course it was bad.\n[2005-05-26 16:57:00] Cabinet Street | I heard him suggest they go back with him. As far as I knew, Tonje once told me she had met a man in a restaurant late at night; he approached their table, clearly drunk. I learned he told them he had come straight from the delivery room—his girlfriend had given birth to their first child that day, and now he was out celebrating. I imagined he then grew inappropriate, becoming increasingly insistent. I thought deep inside, Tonje was profoundly shaken, filled with disgust, though I suspected she was also drawn to him, because I wondered—how was that possible? What on earth was he thinking?\n[2005-05-26 16:58:00] Cabinet Street | I thought I couldn’t imagine a greater betrayal than this. But I reflected—when I searched for women’s gazes, wasn’t I doing exactly the same thing?\n[2005-05-26 17:00:00] Cabinet Street | I realized my thoughts inevitably returned to Nils Nils, and I remembered her at home keeping Vanja company. I recalled their eyes—Vanja’s eyes, alternately curious, excited, drowsy, and Nils Nils’s beautiful eyes. I sighed that back then I had wanted no one but her, and now I not only had her, but also her child. I wondered why this still wasn’t enough to satisfy me? Why couldn’t I stop writing for a year and fully become Vanja’s father, so Nils Nils could finish her studies? I knew I loved them, and they loved me. So why did everything else keep haunting me, tormenting me?\n[2005-05-26 17:01:00] Cabinet Street | I thought I must concentrate harder. I realized that during the day, I should forget everything around me and focus entirely on Vanja. I wanted to give Nils Nils everything she needed. I resolved to be a good person. I sighed—good God, was it really so hard for me to be good?\n[2005-05-26 17:05:00] in front of the Sony store / corner of Akademika bookstore street | I have arrived at the entrance of the newly opened Sony store. I see Marivik Knudt on the opposite side of the road. Before me, he is carrying a Nike shopping bag, and I see him walking toward me from across the street. I am pondering whether to go over to the Akademika bookstore at the corner and buy a few books, then sit for a while in its café.\n[2005-05-26 17:06:00] Humle Park | In Humle Park, I see a thin mist floating above the trees. A man is approaching us. I notice he looks like a hobbit, dressed entirely in black. As far as I know, the first time I saw him was a few weeks after we moved into this apartment. Our eyes meet, and I feel his gaze as dark as night, sending chills down my spine. Who is this person? A wizard?\n[2005-05-26 17:06:10] Humle Park | I ask Nils Nils, 'Did you see him?' I hear her say, 'That’s Marivik Knudt.' I respond, 'That’s Marivik Knudt?'",

    "text": "[2005-05-26 17:07:00] Harvik Street | I hear Nils Nils tell me that he once spoke with Helene, kindly advising her on how to deliver her lines in the play, helping them become part of the character she portrayed. I hear her say those two scripts are extraordinary. As far as I know, Nils Nils’s mother was an actress who once worked with him in a production at the Royal Theatre long ago. I understand that Nils Nils’s closest friend, Helene, is also an actress and collaborated with him too. I’ve also noticed that Nils Nils keeps urging me to read *Chaos and God Are Neighbors* and *Night Is Mother of Day*. But I haven’t read them—I think my reading list is already too long.\n[2005-05-26 17:10:00] Harvik Street | I watch the street and see the writer Marivik Knudt walking past, carrying a shopping bag. As far as I know, I’ve encountered more than just this one writer. I know Astrid Peter has appeared at the bakery near our house; I’ve learned that Olasen and Marta Andersnes often talk at the Sports Café. I know Thomas Torstan was once seen reading on the terrace of Sturehof Restaurant, and I’ve also seen him at Pelikan Restaurant. I’ve also learned that writers like Eriksson, Torstan Lind, or Martavik can sometimes be found at parties in the Contemporary Culture Center or in Södermalm. I think I need to quickly make the most of this unexpected stroke of luck, because I know it’s not easy to run into him on the street. I recall how Thomas Torstan’s work once hit me like a punch to the gut, and when I saw him, my heart pounded as if I were looking at a corpse.\n[2005-05-26 17:15:00] Harvik Street | I remember reading these writers in Baysang, where they were merely foreign names from distant lands. Now seeing them in person gives me a powerful sense of history—realizing they wrote in our time, and future generations will understand us through them. I feel that everything about that evening was so beautiful.\n[2005-05-26 17:20:00] Harvik Street | I realize many of these writers are past their prime and now marginalized. Among the younger writers I read in Baysang, I only liked Magnus Moendal; I felt his *Black Crab* rose above the fog of morality and politics. I recognize this as literature’s unique duty, and I think if a writer remains indifferent to it, they deserve nothing but contempt.\n[2005-05-26 17:21:00] Harvik Street | I inwardly groan with strong disgust—I truly hate their newspapers and articles. I think writers like Gacilevski, Ratama, and Halberg are utterly terrible.\n[2005-05-26 17:22:00] small café opposite Nordiska Kompaniet | Instead of going into Akademika, I stop beside the crosswalk. I look at the sidewalk across the street leading to the old Nordiska Kompaniet building, then cross over. I think I won’t go into Akademika after all. I decide to go to the small café across the street instead. I realize that even though I go there often, the place is busy enough that I can easily remain unnoticed.\n[2005-05-26 17:23:00] the small café | I see an empty table beside the railing of the stairs leading down to the underground hardware supermarket. I walk over, drape my jacket over the back of the chair, watch myself place the book on the table with the cover facing down and the spine turned inward, then head over to join the queue. This way, no one can see what I’m reading.\n[2005-05-26 17:25:00] small café | I watched the three people working behind the counter. I observed the oldest woman moving back and forth behind the counter. I heard the coffee machine hissing. I felt that the three of them looked like siblings. I noticed that the woman had a face like a photograph, which almost canceled out any desire I might have felt. I realized that apart from our gaze, we shared nothing at all.\n[2005-05-26 17:25:10] small café | I scolded myself inwardly in frustration: Damn it, here I go again. Can't I just stop these thoughts?\n[2005-05-26 17:26:00] small café | I pulled a crumpled hundred-kroner bill from my pocket and smoothed it with my hand. I glanced around at the customers in the shop. Before me was a scene where nearly every chair was taken, though shiny shopping bags occupied empty seats. I noticed the customers wearing polished boots and formal attire, their aged skin and mascara-lined eyes, sipping coffee and eating muffins.\n[2005-05-26 17:30:00] small café | I stared at the muffin’s coiled swirls, focusing on the island of cream at its center. I thought that if I were lucky, I’d really like to know what these people are thinking as they sit there. I wondered whether the world they see is entirely different from mine, whether the whole world might be singing inside them with some kind of joy.\n[2005-05-26 17:35:00] small café | I watched the woman in the shop, middle-aged with dyed blonde hair. I saw a shopping bag with an elegant handle resting on her lap. I knew that those brand logos had taken designers weeks of painstaking work to perfect. I thought perhaps she wasn’t particularly joyful, but rather lost in contemplation. I realized that the anxiety of the designer now rested upon her knees, carried in these goods.\n[2005-05-26 17:40:00] small café | I wondered whether she was filled with inner peace after a long life? I recalled foggy November nights, and in my mind’s eye, I saw dogs urinating on lampposts—I imagined whether she too had witnessed such moments that lend mystery to the city.\n[2005-05-26 17:45:00] small café | I felt the air filled with fine particles of drizzle, coating skin and wood, reflecting light. I noticed the grooved glass salt and pepper shakers, their metal nozzles at the top. I smelled the aroma of barbecued pork, lamb leg, and fragrant fried omelets. I marveled at how everything in this gray world shimmered. I remembered seeing a man smash a window and crawl into a basement to steal. I thought that such rich smells and shapes themselves were life experiences, and I realized it was no wonder she sat there searching for peace.\n[2005-05-26 17:46:00] small café | I saw the man ahead of me receive three lattes. I watched the female server with shoulder-length black hair and soft lips. Before I could even speak, I heard her ask me: 'A black coffee?' I noticed her eyes would instantly brighten when she saw someone familiar.\n[2005-05-26 17:46:10] small café | I nodded, watching her turn away. I took the chance to sigh quietly. I figured she must have noticed me too—this tall, scruffy man with stained sweaters and unwashed hair who never seems to clean up.\n[2005-05-26 17:46:30] small café | I watched her take a cup and fill it with coffee. I handed her a hundred-kroner note. I watched her give me change, then saw her smile shift toward my friend behind me. I heard her say to me: 'Here.' In those few seconds, I quickly scanned her from head to toe. I noticed she was wearing knee-high black boots—I wished this fashion would never go out of style. I saw that her nail polish was transparent.\n[2005-05-26 17:47:00] small café | I looked at Dostoevsky's book lying on the table. Before leaning back on the sofa and opening it to read, I quickly glanced around the interior of the café. I felt this book didn't look particularly appealing to me. I realized I've been reading less and less because my threshold for reading has increased. I thought that although I deeply respect the author, immersing myself in the world he writes about makes me feel uneasy.\n[2005-05-26 17:48:00] small café | I pondered how, before Dostoevsky, ideals were always part of a purely powerful heaven. I thought that in his books, everything becomes human, and I realized that if you relinquish will, ideals could be realized right now.\n[2005-05-26 17:49:00] small café | I reflected that humility is the ideal in his most important novels. I realized Dostoevsky remains unidentifiable within his own fiction, and I thought that this is precisely where his greatness lies—because no moral truth is ever directly proclaimed.\n[2005-05-26 17:50:00] small café | I considered how one might examine the concept of nihilism from this perspective. I believed that humanity flows abundantly through his works, and discussions concerning nihilism are therefore rich with meaning.\n[2005-05-26 17:50:00] small café | I sensed fewer and fewer people around me. I watched as the street outside grew darker. I put the book down, stood up, and went to refill my coffee cup. It suddenly struck me in my mind that it was already 5:50. I remembered I should have been home by five. I couldn’t help cursing silently: Shit. Damn it.\n[2005-05-26 17:51:00] small café | I thought about Tolstoy’s detailed descriptions of landscapes and hunting. I realized such objective depictions don’t exist in Dostoevsky’s work—there is always a drama of the soul hidden beneath.\n[2005-05-26 17:51:00] outside the small café | I put on my jacket, stuffed the book into my pocket, and hurried out of the shop. I walked away without looking back. I heard the waitress say behind me, “Hei do!” I opened my mouth and replied, “Hei do.”",

    "text": "[2005-05-26 17:52:00] small café | I realized there is something else within a person besides the depths of the soul—I thought this was what the authors of the Old Testament understood. I sensed a shift in the relationship between humans and the world: once, people wandered through the world; now, the world wanders through people.\n[2005-05-26 17:52:00] Systembolaget liquor store | I walked into the Systembolaget liquor store across the street, grabbed a red wine bottle with a bull’s head on the label from the shelf. Then I proceeded down the aisle into the shopping mall. I felt the inside of the mall was vast and luxurious. I knew I still needed to buy a few things before heading home. I thought I had just randomly grabbed that bottle of red wine. That kind of opulent environment always makes me feel shabby, like a homeless man.\n[2005-05-26 17:53:00] small café | I reflected that when meaning changes, meaninglessness also shifts. I contemplated human value against the backdrop of the universe, imagining whether people are merely one among many insects. I realized meaning isn’t something we receive, but rather something that comes from our giving.\n[2005-05-26 17:54:00] small café | I pondered how death renders life meaningless, yet at the same time gives it meaning. But I reflected that during my lifetime, death seems to have been removed by the media through daily, repetitive coverage.\n[2005-05-26 17:55:00] small café | I realized that a plane crash is akin to a ritual, and I thought we participate in other people's lives by witnessing such events. I felt an inner tension rising, one that had nothing to do with me.\n[2005-05-26 17:55:00] underground supermarket | I saw the meat counter, bought a steak from Gotland Pastures. I grabbed several jars of homemade sauce, then took potatoes and vegetables. I saw fresh raspberries and picked up a basket, then rushed to the freezer to pick out vanilla ice cream and French biscuits. I knew this steak, though shockingly expensive, tasted exceptionally good. Due to laziness and indifference toward money’s value, I always splurged recklessly whenever I had cash. I thought this was foolish and would leave me struggling financially for years afterward.\n[2005-05-26 17:56:00] small café | I inwardly exclaimed, oh no, oh no, oh no—fifteen minutes had passed. I realized I’d been away more than an hour and a half longer than planned. I began to worry about Nils Nils’s mood; I thought this would make the evening too short.\n[2005-05-26 17:57:00] small café | It was hard to say exactly how it happened, but I realized this outcome stemmed from a kind of neglect: unorthodox opinions simply don’t exist in the public sphere. I felt it would take some time before one could even notice this.\n[2005-05-26 17:58:00] small café | I realized perhaps the worst thing was that Mochengdao was greatly celebrated in Leivik. I thought that since liberal democracy had triumphed, the establishment of a world government seemed inevitable, just as Jünger predicted in 1949. I found that even our dreams were becoming similar and commodified; I realized that emphasizing equality was merely another name for indifference, and I felt this was precisely where our night lay.\n[2005-05-26 17:59:00] small café | I remembered Jünger wrote that the nihilistic world is essentially a steadily shrinking world. I thought of tendencies toward specialization and digitization. I realized all domains were being subsumed under a single commonality. I felt this process of continual reduction naturally and inevitably aligned with a movement toward zero.\n[2005-05-26 18:00:00] underground supermarket | I tossed money at the meat counter. I grabbed several jars of homemade sauce, picked up a bag of potatoes, some tomatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. I saw fresh raspberries on the shelf and quickly took a basket. I rushed to the freezer to select vanilla ice cream, then went to the other end of the store to get French biscuits, heading toward the checkout there. Before me were the excellent, mature, plump steaks from Gotland Pastures. I saw a 'new stock' label pasted on the freezer. I knew these steaks came from Gotland and tasted exceptionally good. I thought these meats were outrageously expensive by our standards. I realized I always splurged recklessly when I had money—a foolish habit that would leave me struggling later—but at that moment, I didn’t think of it at all.\n[2005-05-26 18:01:00] underground supermarket | I inwardly exclaimed, oh no, oh no, oh no—fifteen minutes had passed. I realized I’d already been gone an hour and a half longer than I should have. I thought this would make the evening too short. What worried me was her—I felt this late return would leave her anxiously waiting.\n[2005-05-26 18:02:00] underground supermarket | I knew I had recently returned from a three-day short trip to attend a reading. I learned I would have to give a lecture in Bergen next week. As far as I knew, my current schedule was extremely tight—the belt around my neck felt tighter than usual.\n[2005-05-26 18:05:00] basement supermarket checkout counter | I watched the metal tray slowly move toward the cashier. I placed my items on the tray and observed as the cashier lifted each one, turning it in the air. I stared at her face. I heard a beep—the laser scanner reading the barcode. I felt the overhead light glaring down, harsh and bright. The cashier’s broad, fleshy face filled my view; I noticed her downturned mouth and the pores on her skin clearly visible. I saw her carefully styled hair, yet thought it resembled the top of a carrot sprouting green shoots. I thought her movements were like sleepwalking. I realized her facial appearance wasn't due to age, but rather to excessive plumpness.\n[2005-05-26 18:06:00] basement supermarket checkout counter | I saw her glance at her fingernails for a moment. I took out my card, swiped it, and entered my PIN. I gazed at the displayed items. I heard her say, 'Five hundred twenty kroner.' While waiting for the transaction to complete, I suddenly remembered I had forgotten to buy a shopping bag. I wanted to pay properly so she wouldn’t think I was deliberately neglectful. I realized I had no change, and found it ridiculous to swipe my card again just for two kroner. I thought it didn’t matter what she thought of me anyway—after all, she was so fat.\n[2005-05-26 18:06:10] basement supermarket checkout counter | I said, 'I forgot to take a bag.' I heard her reply, 'Two kroner.'\n[2005-05-26 18:06:20] basement supermarket checkout counter | I took a bag from the box beneath the counter and pulled out my credit card again. I heard her ask, 'Don’t you have cash?' I replied, 'Afraid not.'\n[2005-05-26 18:06:30] basement supermarket checkout counter | I watched her wave her hand dismissively. I packed up my things and walked toward the stairs. I saw that the staircase led into a passageway, noticing display cases from auction houses along both walls. I insisted, 'But I want to pay—it's not like that.' I heard her laugh impatiently and say to me, 'Just take it.' I responded, 'Then thank you.'\n[2005-05-26 18:10:00] underground shopping street | I walked out through the main entrance. I passed Nordiska Kompaniet department store. I moved along the underground shopping street, going past Galerian mall, Kulturhuset, and Sergels Torg, all the way to the Central Station subway. I walked through the underground passage leading to the train station. The flickering lights of the underground shopping street came into view. I know that on rainy days I always take this route. I’m aware that this underground world connects with various shopping malls. I find the underground world fascinating, like an adventure into the unknown. I realize this preference stems from my childhood—I recall how even a single hole could once be the most thrilling discovery.\n[2005-05-26 18:10:10] underground shopping street | I remember one winter, either 1976 or 1977, when more than two meters of snow fell. As far as I know, we dug several snow caves in our garden, connected by tunnels that even reached the neighbor’s yard. I know that when night fell, we would sit beneath the thick layer of snow and chat. Recalling that experience, I marvel at how enchanted we were by what we’d built that day.",

    "text": "[2005-05-26 18:12:00] outside American Bar | I passed the crowded American Bar. I saw people sitting on chairs draped with thick jackets, their faces flushed red. I noticed slender young men and women in black aprons moving back and forth. I watched five or six people waiting outside, rummaging for tobacco or using their phones. I saw someone pick out a passerby and offer them a smile. I heard the constant noisy chatter. I heard loud laughter burst out when the door opened. I sensed a warm, friendly atmosphere. I saw trays of beer and emptied glasses being collected. I noticed someone holding a phone to their ear, waiting expectantly. I know it’s Friday, and people come here after work to drink beer. I thought those people were simply looking for a kind smile.\n[2005-05-26 18:13:00] street | I watched a line of cars slowly glide along the roadside. I observed the stream of people pouring out from Nordiska Kompaniet. I heard someone behind me say, 'Taxi, to Kabinetsgatan...' The faces inside the cars came into view, illuminated faintly by streetlights, covered in a mysterious glow. I saw the drivers’ faces lit by the pale blue dashboard lights. I felt some faces tremble slightly from the bass and drumbeats. I saw thick leather jackets, dark wool coats, and piles of shopping bags. I noticed occasional puffer jackets, low-rise pants, and knitted caps. I heard the loudspeaker announcement that the mall would close in fifteen minutes.\n[2005-05-26 18:13:30] street | I saw a woman run past, clutching her hat, her coat flapping against her legs. I turned to stare after her. I watched her disappear around the corner leading to Kungsträdgården. I wondered why she was in such a hurry—this seemed urgent. But then I realized nothing significant had actually happened.\n[2005-05-26 18:14:00] street | I saw three beggars sitting on a grating against the wall. When I passed by them, I deliberately looked away. I crossed the street and walked past the stiff facade of the College Bookstore. I saw a cardboard sign asking for money to get through the night, and beside it a hat containing coins. I saw the other two beggars drinking. I was thinking that Nils Nils might be getting angry, and that she perhaps felt this evening was ruined again. I realized I was worried she might think I didn't want to see her.\n[2005-05-26 18:15:00] street/apartment entrance | I crossed the intersection and passed by the expensive Italian restaurant. I glanced at Glenn Miller Café and saw two people getting out of a car. I walked toward Nalen and saw a band tour bus with a trailer and a radio station bus. I stepped up three stairs and entered through the door after punching in the code. I saw a thick bundle of heavy cables running from the tour bus all the way onto the sidewalk. I knew Nalen was a venue for performances. I learned that a white bus belonging to Mochengdao Radio was parked there. I strained hard to recall who was supposed to perform here tonight, but realized my effort was ultimately futile.\n[2005-05-26 18:16:00] apartment stairs | I started climbing the stairs. I met the Russian woman coming down. I greeted her: \"Hi!\" I heard a door open and shut above me, followed by the loud sound of a door being slammed. From that slamming sound alone, I could tell it was the Russian woman. I realized it was already too late to take the elevator. I noticed she pretended not to see me again.\n[2005-05-26 18:16:10] apartment stairs | I watched her walk past me. I heard her mutter something only after she had passed. I thought this Russian woman was literally a neighbor from hell.\n[2005-05-26 18:17:00] apartment stairs | I had heard her shouting and screaming from downstairs. I recalled how the bass and kick drum from Euro disco made the floor tremble and the windowpanes rattle. I felt the music was so loud we couldn't talk. I learned her apartment had been empty for seven months before we moved in. I remember being woken up at half past one in the morning in 2004 by the sound of her slamming doors. I know she then began playing extremely loud music nonstop. I thought about how even I, someone who usually sleeps soundly through noise, became completely sleepless. I remembered Nils Nils was eight months pregnant at the time and already suffered from insomnia.\n[2005-05-26 18:18:00] living room at home | I recalled that we got up and went into the living room. I once went downstairs to ring her doorbell and knock on her door. I learned that ringing the bell and knocking received no response. I know we stayed in the living room for half an hour. I wondered whether I should call the duty phone, but I didn’t want to do that—I thought it would feel too Mochengdao. I hoped the music might just stop on its own.\n[2005-05-26 18:19:00] neighbor's doorway | I learned that eventually Nils Nils herself went downstairs, and suddenly the woman opened the door. I saw the woman place her hand on Nils Nils’s belly. I heard her say in Mochengdao with a Russian accent: \"You're going to have a baby. I'm so sorry, truly sorry, but my husband has left me, and I don't know what to do. Music and alcohol help me endure this cold Mochengdao. But you're about to have a baby—you need sleep, don't you, dear?\" As far as I know, the woman was completely understanding.\n[2005-05-26 18:20:00] bedroom at home | I recalled walking into the bedroom with Nils Nils and getting into bed. I remember just falling asleep when that damn noise started again. I recalled the same shouts between tracks. I felt that same insane volume. I know Nils Nils came back and told me what they talked about. I remember feeling relieved that things had progressed, and we were both happy. But I learned the noise started up again ten minutes later.\n[2008-02-27 10:00:00] studio | To the heart, I think the meaning of life is simple enough: I believe it will keep beating as long as possible, then stop.\n[2008-02-27 10:00:10] studio | I realize that sooner or later, this steady, rhythmic heartbeat will simply come to an end on its own.\n[2008-02-27 10:00:20] studio | I imagined how the blood would flow to the lowest, most vulnerable parts of the body, and I realized a small lump would form there.\n[2008-02-27 10:00:30] studio | I thought it would look like a dark, congested patch spreading across skin that was gradually turning pale.\n[2008-02-27 10:00:40] studio | I realized that at the same time, body temperature would drop, limbs would stiffen, and I imagined the intestines and stomach within the abdomen emptying completely.\n[2008-02-27 10:00:50] studio | I observed that in the first few hours, these changes progressed extremely slowly. I realized they followed a certain assured, almost ritualistic procedure.\n[2008-02-27 10:01:00] studio | I found myself reflecting inwardly, as if the chapters of life proceed according to some inherent law, fulfilling a kind of 'gentlemen's agreement.'\n[2008-02-27 10:01:10] studio | I realized it is only after this that death steps forward.\n[2008-02-27 10:01:15] studio | I observed that death always waits for life to recede before beginning its invasion and occupation of this new territory.\n[2008-02-27 10:01:25] studio | I found this to be an uncompromising, irreversible process of reclaiming what was owed.\n[2008-02-27 10:01:35] studio | I began to associate it with the intense heat that arises, as bacteria and viruses start spreading uncontrollably within the body, their advance unstoppable.\n[2008-02-27 10:01:45] studio | I wondered, had they tried to invade just a few hours earlier, they would have immediately met resistance; but now I saw that all around them was only silence, and I thought they needed only to keep moving steadily deeper into the damp, dark regions.\n[2008-02-27 10:02:00] studio | I pictured in my mind how this invading army enters the Haversian canal, passes through the intestinal glands, settles into the islets of Langerhans, penetrates Bowman's capsule, travels along the columns of Goll, reaches the substantia nigra in the midbrain, and finally arrives at the heart.\n[2008-02-27 10:02:15] studio | I sensed it continuing to exist in a state not yet touched but already plundered.\n[2008-02-27 10:02:25] studio | I marveled at how the entire structure had been completely hollowed out from within, filled with a strange desolation and decay.\n[2008-02-27 10:02:35] studio | I thought people could imagine it as a construction site where all the workers had suddenly vanished in the blink of an eye.\n[2008-02-27 10:02:45] studio | Before my eyes, all the vehicles stood motionless; I saw the yellow beams of their headlights cast into the darkness of the woods. I found the temporary work sheds completely empty.\n[2008-02-27 10:02:55] studio | I stood on a sloping road beside the mountain, watching carriage after carriage hanging from the cableway. I noticed that all the carriages were fully loaded.\n[2008-02-27 10:03:10] studio | I understood that in the very instant life leaves the body, the body belongs to death.\n[2008-02-27 10:03:20] studio | I looked around at the abandoned lamps, bags, carpets, door handles, window frames, and also the mud, swamps, streams, mountains, clouds, and sky.\n[2008-02-27 10:03:30] studio | I felt that none of this was unfamiliar to us; I realized we continue to be surrounded by the objects and natural phenomena of this world of death.\n[2008-02-27 10:03:40] studio | I believed that even so, once one truly sees someone fallen into that world, something still stirs deep discomfort within me.\n[2008-02-27 10:03:50] studio | I thought that at least until the situation was certain, we should do everything possible to keep the bodies of the dead out of our sight.\n[2008-02-27 10:04:00] studio | As far as I know, in large hospitals, not only are bodies kept hidden in separate, remotely isolated rooms, but the corridors leading there are also concealed. I noticed this spatial separation.\n[2008-02-27 10:04:10] studio | I learned that hospitals have dedicated elevators and special underground passageways. I became aware of the existence of these dedicated facilities.\n[2008-02-27 10:04:20] studio | I observed that even if someone happened to wander into that area by mistake, the bodies on passing carts were always carefully covered.\n[2008-02-27 10:04:30] studio | I found that when bodies were to be removed from the hospital, there were designated exits and dark-windowed vehicles.\n[2008-02-27 10:04:40] studio | At the church cemetery, I saw they had a separate windowless room prepared for the dead.\n[2008-02-27 10:04:50] studio | I watched as they were buried deep underground, or reduced to ashes in high furnaces. I saw that during funeral ceremonies, they were enclosed within tightly sealed coffins.\n[2008-02-27 10:05:00] studio | I was thinking that from a practical standpoint, it was hard to see what advantages such advanced handling methods offered.\n[2008-02-27 10:05:15] studio | I wondered, for instance, whether there was any need to cover the bodies while wheeling them through all the hospital corridors—I even thought ordinary taxis could be used to carry them away from the hospital.\n[2008-02-27 10:05:25] studio | I felt it wouldn't pose any risk to anyone.\n[2008-02-27 10:05:35] studio | I think if an old man passes away during a movie screening, he might as well stay in his seat until the film ends—I don't see why he couldn't remain there even until the second movie finishes.\n[2008-02-27 10:05:45] studio | I think if a teacher suddenly dies of a stroke on school grounds, there's no need to immediately rush over and carry him away by car.\n[2008-02-27 10:05:55] studio | I'd prefer to let him lie there until the janitor has time to deal with it—perhaps in the afternoon or even evening. I know it wouldn't harm anyone.\n[2008-02-27 10:06:05] studio | In my mind, I imagine perhaps a bird might fly down and perch on him, pecking here and there—and I wonder, what harm would that do?\n[2008-02-27 10:06:15] studio | I reflect inwardly—would things really be better once he's buried, simply because we no longer see it all?\n[2008-02-27 10:06:25] studio | I realize there's actually no reason to act so hastily, as long as the deceased isn't in the way. After all, they can't die again.\n[2008-02-27 10:06:35] studio | I think this approach should be especially favorable during the harsh days of winter.\n[2008-02-27 10:06:45] studio | Before my eyes appear the homeless who froze to death on benches and platforms, suicides leaping from high buildings and bridges, elderly women falling from escalators, people dying in car crashes while still seated in their vehicles, young men stumbling into lakes after a night out in the city, drunk and disoriented, and little girls dragged under bus wheels. I ask myself—why are we always in such a hurry to quickly hide away this series of dead bodies?\n[2008-02-27 10:07:00] studio | I reflect inwardly—is it really for the sake of propriety?\n[2008-02-27 10:07:10] studio | I think it might actually be more respectful to wait one or two hours, allowing the girl’s parents time to come and see her one last time.\n[2008-02-27 10:07:20] studio | I pictured in my mind her lying beside the accident site in the snow, her skull cracked open yet her body intact, her hair soaked with blood and her down jacket still clean.\n[2008-02-27 10:07:30] studio | I thought to myself, open everything up to the world, lie there just as she did—there was nothing secret about it.\n[2008-02-27 10:07:40] studio | I realized that yet an hour like this on the snow was so incomprehensible.\n[2008-02-27 10:07:50] studio | I thought, a city that does not exclude its dead from public view, where bodies lie strewn across streets and alleys, parks and parking lots, is not a city—it is hell.\n[2008-02-27 10:08:00] studio | I realized that this hell reflects, in a more realistic and profound way, the conditions of our existence.\n[2008-02-27 10:08:10] studio | I sighed inwardly, but what difference does it make? I know full well we were already aware of this reality—we simply chose not to look.\n[2008-02-27 10:08:20] studio | I believed that the collective act of driving the dead away is proof enough of this.\n[2008-02-27 10:08:30] studio | I struggled within myself, yet I couldn't clearly articulate what exactly it was that we wanted to shut out or drive away.\n[2008-02-27 10:08:40] studio | I thought it couldn't possibly be death itself—it must be that the phenomenon of death exists too prominently or too abundantly in society.\n[2008-02-27 10:08:50] studio | As far as I know, the number of deaths mentioned in newspapers or news reports varies somewhat depending on circumstances. I realized that over the course of a year or half, the numbers might remain fairly stable, gradually becoming something we take for granted.\n[2008-02-27 10:09:00] studio | I thought to myself that since news always spreads through multiple channels, there was no way I could avoid it.\n[2008-02-27 10:09:10] studio | I felt that the phenomenon of simultaneous death didn't seem particularly threatening.\n[2008-02-27 10:09:20] studio | I realized that on the contrary, there are certain deaths we remain interested in—even willing to pay to witness.\n[2008-02-27 10:09:30] studio | I became aware of the astonishing number of feature films produced by movie studios that depict death.\n[2008-02-27 10:09:40] studio | I realized that this made the practice of excluding the dead from public view increasingly difficult to understand.\n[2008-02-27 10:09:50] studio | I inwardly asked myself: if death as a phenomenon does not horrify us, then why do I feel discomfort when confronted with a dead body?\n[2008-02-27 10:10:00] studio | I realized this must mean either that there are two kinds of death, or that there is a conflict and gap between our imagination of death and its actual reality.",

    "text": "[2008-02-27 10:10:15] studio | I realized that regardless of the reason, the conclusion comes down to one thing: the image we hold of death is so powerfully imprinted in our consciousness that when I see death manifested in reality, I am not only shocked, but also instinctively try to conceal it by any means possible.\n[2008-02-27 10:10:00] studio | I learned that in our time, just like religious rituals such as funerals, matters surrounding death can be negotiated and resolved—thus shifting from the irrational to the rational, from the collective to the individual. I realized this outcome did not arise from people's conscious deliberation. I couldn't help but think that removing the dead from sight has never been questioned; we've always done it this way, as if it were self-evident.\n[2008-02-27 10:10:45] studio | I found that yet no one could provide a justification for the necessity of this practice.\n[2008-02-27 10:10:55] studio | I think everyone understands: if my father were to suddenly die out on the grass one windy Sunday in autumn, I would carry him back indoors as quickly as possible; and if that weren't possible, at least I would cover him with a blanket.\n[2008-02-27 10:11:10] studio | I realize this impulse isn't the only way we deal with the dead—just as obvious as hiding the body is the fact that they are always moved as quickly as possible in the direction of the ground.\n[2008-02-27 10:11:20] studio | Before my eyes appears a hospital moving a corpse upward, with the morgue and crematorium located on the top floor of the building. I realize this is almost unimaginable.\n[2008-02-27 10:11:30] studio | I think to myself that the dead should be placed as close to the ground as possible.\n[2008-02-27 10:11:40] studio | I imagine that if this same principle applied to institutions handling such matters, then an insurance company could perfectly well place its offices on the eighth floor—but a funeral home could not.\n[2008-02-27 10:11:50] studio | I notice that all funeral homes position their premises as close as possible to the street-level lawn.\n[2008-02-27 10:12:00] studio | I find it difficult to articulate exactly why this is.\n[2008-02-27 10:12:10] studio | As far as I know, this is likely a notion shaped by traditional customs rooted entirely in practical purposes. I think this is likely a notion shaped by traditional customs rooted entirely in practical purposes.\n[2008-02-27 10:12:20] studio | I feel the coldness of the cellar, which naturally seems best suited for preserving bodies. I think, for instance, that the cellar is cold and thus naturally best suited for preserving bodies.\n[2008-02-27 10:12:30] studio | I realize that even in today’s age, when refrigerators and cold rooms exist, no one would ever consider moving a corpse upward in a building. I find this seems profoundly unreasonable—as though height and death inherently repel each other.\n[2008-02-27 10:12:40] studio | I feel as though we have a certain kind of latent intuition, a complex buried deep within our hearts—I think that our dead must descend into the earth, for fallen leaves ultimately return to their roots.\n[2008-02-27 10:12:50] studio | To me, death seems divided into two categories through different channels.\n[2008-02-27 10:13:00] studio | I realize one category is associated with secrecy, heaviness, earth, filth, and darkness, while the other is linked to openness, lightness, sky, purity, and brightness.\n[2008-02-27 10:13:15] studio | As far as I know, in a city in the Middle East, a father and his child were shot, and at that moment the father tried to pull the child out of the bullet's line of fire. The image of that father trying to drag his child out of the bullet’s path flashes in my mind at the instant he was shot.\n[2008-02-27 10:13:25] studio | Looking at the photo where their two bodies are tightly wrapped together, I notice the camera happened to capture the tremor of their flesh as the bullet pierced through muscle.\n[2008-02-27 10:13:35] studio | I imagine the photo being transmitted to one of the thousands of satellites orbiting Earth, then broadcast across television stations worldwide.\n[2008-02-27 10:13:45] studio | I realize another image of death and near-death has unconsciously entered my consciousness from here.\n[2008-02-27 10:13:55] studio | I feel these images are weightless, unexaggerated, timeless and placeless; I also realize they have nothing to do with where these bodies originally came from.\n[2008-02-27 10:14:05] studio | I silently sigh in my heart—they belong nowhere, yet are everywhere.\n[2008-02-27 10:14:15] studio | I realize most images only linger briefly in my consciousness, but I think some, for whatever reason, will remain lodged in the darkness of my mind.\n[2008-02-27 10:14:25] studio | I saw a vivid trail of blood dragging down the white snow slope behind her, and I noticed she had already died before her body stopped sliding. A skier plunging from above and suffering a fatal accident flashed in my mind—his femoral artery slashed open, blood gushing out uncontrollably.\n[2008-02-27 10:14:35] studio | I saw the deep blue sky above the rooftops on the outskirts, and beneath this expanse of azure, I witnessed the plane explode into a fireball. In my mind's eye, I pictured a terrifying scene: a plane taking off, its wings bursting into flames during ascent, finally exploding.\n[2008-02-27 10:15:00] studio | I know that on that night in 1976 I was eight years old, and I also learned that my father was thirty-two at the time. I recall that night when I was eight, and my father was exactly thirty-two.\n[2008-02-27 10:15:10] studio | Although I still can't say I truly understand or know what kind of person he was, I think now, being seven years older than he was then, some simple things are easier to grasp.\n[2008-02-27 10:15:20] studio | I realize how vast the difference is between our respective stages in life.\n[2008-02-27 10:15:40] studio | I feel my life is filled with boundless meaning; each step forward opens a door, and every door could lead me to the farthest horizon.\n[2008-02-27 10:15:50] studio | What I cannot comprehend now is that his sense of life’s meaning seemed not, as one might expect, to lie in gathering countless daily events into a coherent whole, but rather in completely dispersing them.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | Therefore, I feel it's impossible for me to grasp the essence except through some abstract concepts.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | As far as I know, 'family' was one thing to him, 'career' another. I know there wasn’t a single unexpected possibility in his days.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | I learned that he mostly knew how much possibility the future held, and how he could make that possibility real.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | To my knowledge, he had already been married for twelve years and had been teaching at a secondary school for eight years.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | To my knowledge, he owned a house and a car, and had two children.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | I knew that he had been elected to the municipal council and served as the Left Party's representative on the city government committee.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | I learned that during the winter half of the year, he devoted himself to stamp collecting and achieved remarkable success; I knew that in a short time he had become preeminent in this region.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:00] studio | As far as I knew, during the summer half of the year, he spent all his spare time tending his garden.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:10] studio | I silently marveled—I knew nothing about what he might have been thinking that spring night.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:20] studio | I thought, I also had no idea what scene he saw when he straightened up in the dim twilight, hammer in hand.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:30] studio | I realized, however, that deep inside he must have felt he understood the world he lived in quite well—and this, I firmly believed.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | To my knowledge, he knew every neighbor in the entire residential area by name, and could place each one socially in relation to himself.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | I gathered that he might even know certain private matters others most wished to keep hidden—not only because he taught their children, but also because he had a sharp eye for people’s weaknesses.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | As far as I know, as a newly established member of the educated middle class, he receives a constant stream of information from daily newspapers, radio, and television programs, keeping him well-informed about the vast world around him.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | I learned that he also has some knowledge of botany and zoology, as he had developed an interest in them during his youth. Even if he hasn't pursued in-depth studies in other natural sciences, at least he acquired the fundamental knowledge during his high school years.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | I understand that he did quite well in history, which he studied as a major subject alongside Leivik and English during university. In other words, perhaps he isn't truly proficient in any one of them, but has a passing familiarity with each—except for pedagogy.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | From what I know, he was just like that—a typical ordinary college graduate.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | I learned that teaching at secondary schools was still a socially respected profession back then.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | As far as I know, Presbakkmo, the neighbor living on the other side of the stone wall, was a teacher at the same school as he was.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | I understand that similarly, another neighbor, Olsen, who lived behind the house on a wooded hillside, was also a teacher.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:40] studio | I know that among them was another neighbor, Knudsen, who lived at the end of the winding road—he was a headmaster at another secondary school.\n[2008-02-27 10:16:50] studio | I learned that the spring night when my father raised the hammer high above his head and brought it down heavily onto the rock was in the mid-1970s. I recall in my mind how my father struck the rocks then; I think within this world so familiar to him, he was filled with confidence.\n[2008-02-27 10:17:00] studio | I realize that now, having reached the same age as he was then, the first thing I understand is that arriving at this point comes at a price.\n[2008-02-27 10:17:10] studio | I realized that as the world within my field of vision becomes increasingly chaotic and complex, not only do the emotional pain points gradually diminish, but I also begin to feel that many things are ultimately meaningless.\n[2008-02-27 10:17:20] studio | I thought that to understand the world, one must position oneself at a fixed distance from it.\n[2008-02-27 10:17:30] studio | I thought that when we use our naked eyes to look at tiny things—like molecules or atoms—we find them blurry, so we must magnify them in order to see clearly.\n[2008-02-27 10:17:40] studio | I thought that for vast, unreachable phenomena—such as celestial systems, river deltas, or constellations across the sky—we must shrink them down in our minds to comprehend them.\n[2008-02-27 10:17:50] studio | I realized that once we bring all these things into the scope of our consciousness, everything suddenly feels resolved.\n[2008-02-27 10:18:00] studio | I realized that this sense of resolution—is knowledge itself.\n[2008-02-27 10:18:10] studio | I silently marveled at how throughout childhood and adolescence, all our struggles were aimed at reaching that single point—one precise position—where we could maintain the right distance from all things and phenomena.\n[2008-02-27 10:18:20] studio | I recalled inwardly how we read, we studied, we experienced, and we continuously corrected ourselves.\n[2008-02-27 10:18:30] studio | I realized that then the day finally arrives—when we reach that point of necessary distance from all phenomena, and gain the conceptual framework of understanding we need.\n[2008-02-27 10:18:40] studio | I realized that by this moment, time begins to slip away rapidly. It no longer encounters obstacles—everything is ready.\n[2008-02-27 10:18:50] studio | I realized that time rushes through our lives like a flood, and days pass in the blink of an eye.\n[2008-02-27 10:19:00] studio | I realized that before we even grasp this, we are already forty, fifty, sixty... I thought, meaning requires fullness, fullness requires time, and time requires an enemy.\n[2008-02-27 10:19:10] studio | I realized that knowledge is distance, knowledge is stability and constancy, knowledge is the enemy of meaning.\n[2008-02-27 10:19:20] studio | I sighed inwardly. In other words, the image of my father on that spring evening in 1976 now carries a double meaning: first, back then I saw him through the eyes of an eight-year-old child—without foresight, timidly fearful; second, now I see him as someone of the same age, as time has flowed through his entire life, constantly stripping away, in large chunks, the meaning from his existence.\n[2008-02-27 23:43:00] studio | I am sitting here writing these words. I think about how thirty years have already passed since I began sitting here to write. In the glass pane before me, I see the reflection of my face.\n[2008-02-27 23:43:10] studio | I gaze at my reflection in the mirror. I notice that apart from my eyes, which still glimmer with light, the rest of my face appears dull due to faint reflections, the entire left side cast in shadow. I see two deep wrinkles crossing my forehead, and one deep groove carved into each cheek, the lines dark. I wonder what this face would look like when these eyes stare seriously and the corners of the mouth turn slightly downward—how grim it would appear.\n[2008-02-27 23:43:20] studio | I ponder within: what exactly has been inscribed upon this face?\n[2008-02-27 23:43:30] studio | As far as I know, today is February 27, 2008, and the clock reads 23:43. I know that Grete Lundnes was born in December 1968. I realize that at this very moment of writing, I am already thirty-nine years old.\n[2008-02-27 23:43:40] studio | I know I have three children: Vanja, Lundlund, and Helen Ster. I also know that my wife is Nils Nils Boström, from my second marriage. As far as I know, all four of them are asleep in rooms nearby. I know we live in an apartment in Kristianvik, where we’ve resided for a year and a half.\n[2008-02-27 23:43:50] studio | I realize that apart from contact with parents from the children’s kindergarten, we don’t know anyone. I think I don’t miss anyone, nor do I have any social life—at least not from my perspective.\n[2008-02-27 23:44:00] studio | I thought I would never voice my true thoughts, never express personal opinions, always closely following and clinging to the topics everyone was passionately discussing, pretending to be interested in what they said. I realized that drinking was the only exception.\n[2008-02-27 23:44:10] studio | I realized that once alcohol entered my system, I would do precisely the opposite—and usually go very far. I thought the intense dread after sobering up has only intensified over the years, now lasting for weeks at a time. I found that when I drink, I suffer brief memory lapses and completely lose control over my behavior. I realized I most often become depressed, foolish, and sometimes even dangerously erratic.\n[2008-02-27 23:44:20] studio | I thought that’s why I quit drinking. I realized I didn’t want others to come near me, didn’t want anyone to see me. I thought the result was inevitable: no one touches me, no one sees me.\n[2008-02-27 23:44:30] studio | I realized this is exactly what must be read on this face. I thought this is why it has become so stiff, as if wearing a mask. I noticed that whenever I happen to catch sight of this face in a street-facing window, it's almost impossible to associate it with myself.",

    "text": "[2008-02-27 23:44:40] studio | I noticed the only unchanged part of the face is the eyes. I thought they are just as clear on the day you're born as on the day you die. I realized they may well be bloodshot or clouded by membranes, but the inner light remains.\n[2008-02-27 23:44:50] studio | To my knowledge, Rembrandt’s late works are typically characterized by extremely rough brushwork, stripping away all details to intensify the instantaneous impression, dazzling in effect. I know perhaps Hölderlin’s poetry from his later years could be comparable. I recalled seeing a late self-portrait of Rembrandt in Shannest; each time I saw it, I was equally deeply moved. I marveled at its artistic achievement as unmatched, even though the two—painting and poetry—are incomparable and cannot be ranked.\n[2008-02-27 23:45:00] studio | I thought Hölderlin’s brilliance manifests in the ethereal and mysterious quality of words, while Rembrandt’s radiance flows through color—simple and metallic. I noticed the technique of this painting hanging in the Shannest National Museum leans more toward classical realism. I felt it feels closer to real life, resembling Rembrandt’s earlier stylistic approach.\n[2008-02-27 23:45:10] studio | I stared at the painting. I was amazed that this painting reveals aging—this is old age. I saw every facial detail exposed, allowing me to read the traces left by time. I noticed deep wrinkles, sagging skin, the remnants of passing years. I found his eyes clear—I thought these were not youthful eyes; they belonged to another time. I felt as if another person was gazing out at us from a completely different place within the face.\n[2008-02-27 23:45:20] studio | I wanted to approach the mind of that other person, but realized how difficult it truly was. I realized all of this was uniquely personal to Rembrandt—his habits, voice, thoughts, and physical imperfections. I found that all these things once distinguished him from others, yet I lamented that they have now completely vanished.\n[2008-02-27 23:45:30] studio | I looked at this portrait. I know this is a painting from over four hundred years ago. I learned that Rembrandt died in the same year this painting was made. Looking at this portrait painted by Rembrandt’s own hand, I felt it was as alive as a breathing being. I imagined that each morning he awoke and sank into thoughts and emotions—but they were not his own. I mused that to forget everything each night upon falling asleep—wouldn’t that be blissful?\n[2008-02-27 23:45:40] studio | I think a person who transcends time never loses the gleam in their eyes. I realized the difference in this painting lies between looking at someone and being looked at. I found this peculiar quality exists only in Baroque art styles. I marveled at the exquisite craftsmanship that elevated its standard to the highest peak, and I felt such perfect painting could indeed exist—it is here before us to behold.\n[2008-02-27 23:46:00] studio | I recalled the night Vania was born. I saw her lying there, gazing at us for hours. I noticed her eyes were like two black lanterns, her body covered in blood, her long hair stuck to her scalp. I observed that when she moved, it was with a slow, reptilian wriggle. I watched her lying on Nils Nils’s belly, staring at us—I felt as though she were watching us from deep within the woods.\n[2008-02-27 23:46:10] studio | I stuck out my tongue. I thought we couldn’t take our eyes off her. I asked myself what exactly I saw in her. It felt quiet, serious, and unfathomable. I watched myself keep my tongue out for nearly a minute, then saw her stick hers out too. I realized I had never in my life felt so confident about the future, nor experienced such overwhelming joy.\n[2008-02-27 23:46:20] studio | I observed my daughter. I knew she was four years old now. I realized everything had changed. I observed her sharp, alert eyes, and noticed how instantly she could shift from pure delight to intense jealousy. I saw that she already knew what she wanted, and I thought she was becoming too cunning—so much so that she might finally make me lose my patience.\n[2008-02-27 23:46:30] studio | I shook her hard. I thought I might jump up and scream at her, or grab her and shake her until she cried. I found she often just laughed. I recalled the last time I was so enraged I shook her violently, yet all I saw was her bursting into laughter. I suddenly panicked, immediately thinking to touch her chest.\n[2008-02-27 23:46:40] studio | I touched her chest. I felt her heart beating. I silently exclaimed, oh my God, it’s beating.\n[2008-03-04 07:55:00] studio | I sat in the study. It was a few minutes before eight in the morning. I was in my study, surrounded by books piled from floor to ceiling. Mochengdao Forest Band’s music played in the background. I realized today was March 4, 2008. As I listened to the music, I reflected on what I had written and how to move forward.\n[2008-03-04 07:55:10] studio | I knew Nils Nils and Helen Ster were sleeping in the room next door. I remembered Vania and Lundlund were at kindergarten—I had dropped them off half an hour earlier.\n[2008-03-04 07:55:20] studio | I looked out the window. Outside, the tall Hilton Hotel still lay in shadow. I saw the three glass-paneled vertical elevators on its façade continuously rising and descending. Next to the hotel stood a red brick building. Judging by the column structures and arched doorways, I concluded it must have been built in the late 19th or early 20th century.\n[2008-03-04 07:55:30] studio | I looked upward. Beyond it, a corner of Sheriff Park emerged faintly in the morning light. I noticed bare branches and green grass. At the far end, a gray brick building from the 1970s blocked the view. I shifted my gaze upward and saw, for the first time in several weeks, a clear blue sky.\n[2008-03-04 07:55:40] studio | I realized that after living here for a year and a half, I’ve become familiar with the view outside my window. Yet I feel it has nothing to do with me—nothing I see here means anything to me. I wonder if perhaps this is exactly what I’ve been seeking. I find myself liking this, maybe even needing it.\n[2008-03-04 07:55:50] studio | I recall writing in Baysang six years ago. I remember that although I never thought of spending my whole life there, I hadn’t planned to leave the country or my then-wife. Our future, as we imagined it, was merely an extension of our present life—I pictured myself writing novels in Bærum. I realize now that future wasn’t special at all.\n[2008-03-04 07:56:00] studio | I remember one day I went to Hårvik. I marvel at how suddenly things changed—what began as a plan to stay for just a few weeks unexpectedly became my entire life. I realize I didn’t just change cities; I changed everyone around me. It feels strange that I did this—how did I end up here? Why did it turn out this way?\n[2008-03-04 07:56:15] studio | I know that when I first arrived in Hårvik, I only knew two people. I recall having some contact with Karl Larsdal in Baysang back in the spring of 1990. I learned that I met Nils Nils during a workshop for new literary talents in the spring of 1999. I realize I wasn’t close to either of them, and that was many years ago now.\n[2008-03-04 07:56:25] studio | I sent a letter to Karl Larsdal asking if I could stay with him for a few days. Then, while staying there, I placed a rental ad in two Mochengdao newspapers and selected two replies from over forty responses. I looked at both places—one on Bastu Street, the other on Blansjørka Street—and finally decided to rent the second one. I noticed that when my eyes fell on the list of tenants by the staircase entrance, I saw the name Nils Nils there. I knew I was urgently trying to find a place to stay in Hårvik.\n[2008-03-04 07:56:35] studio | As far as I know, Hårvik has a population of over fifteen million, yet the cultural circle is relatively small. I thought to myself how small the world really is, that such a thing could happen. I realized that if it had been through personal introductions, the odds might not have been so slim—but this was an anonymous ad seen by hundreds, possibly thousands. The people who replied naturally knew neither Nils Nils nor me.\n[2008-03-04 07:56:45] studio | I know that Nils Nils is now the woman I’m married to, and the mother of my three children. At that moment, I decided to change my mind again, thinking it would be better to choose the other place. I realized that if I moved in here, she might think I had intentions toward her. Yet I also marveled inwardly—this felt like a sign, full of meaning. I realized that now, she is indeed sharing my life.\n[2008-03-04 07:56:55] studio | I know that the books and records I brought with me are the only traces left from my previous life. I realize I not only read Proust’s novels but also drew great experience from them. I thought that everything else I’ve let fade into dust. I recall spending much time back then dwelling on the past—now, looking back, that state was almost pathological. I realize that the past now barely reaches me in my thoughts.\n[2008-03-04 07:57:05] studio | I think the main reason is that we have children—their lives fill every space and moment. I realize that everything recent has been pushed aside. I ask myself: if asked what I did three days ago, I can’t remember; if asked about my children two years ago, I can’t recall. I sigh—so much repetition in the trivialities of daily life. I realize that what has changed most in me is my perception of time.\n[2008-03-04 07:57:15] studio | I recall how time once appeared to me as a stretch extending into the future, filled with bright expectations. Now, life here follows a completely different pattern—if I were to depict it in a painting, it would be like a boat before a lock. I feel time as gentle waves approaching evenly from all sides, steadily lifting life forward. I realize that apart from details, everything remains endlessly the same.\n[2008-03-04 07:57:25] studio | I sighed, feeling that as days passed and life brushed against its edges, I would grow fonder of the past and yearn for the path ahead to open. I realized this repetition and lack of change were necessary—they offered me protection. I thought that once I stepped away from them, all my old troubles would return.\n[2008-03-04 07:57:35] studio | I thought how suddenly I could be overwhelmed by countless thoughts, as if thrown back into that uncontrolled, unproductive state from years ago. I felt that my old aspirations still burned strong, yet I realized their fulfillment was impossible here and now. I understood I had to seek another purpose here—find peace within the survival of art.\n[2008-03-04 07:57:45] studio | I watched Lundlund climb down from her toddler bed at five in the morning. I saw her stumble across the dark floor, and seconds later, I watched her flick on the light switch and stand before me. I heard her call out to me, still drowsy: “Köket”. The whole house was still pitch black; I felt the quiet stillness of early morning in the air. I knew her Mochengdao language was distinctive, with words carrying meanings she invented herself. As far as I knew, 'kitchen' meant muesli with blueberry yogurt; I also learned that whenever she saw a candle, she would sing the birthday song. I thought it wouldn’t be hard to sketch her on paper. Looking at her, I realized she had a unique way of expressing emotion.\n[2008-03-04 07:57:55] studio | I saw that Lundlund had big eyes and a wide mouth. I observed that in the first few months, she seized almost every opportunity to hurt her younger brother. I saw the scratch marks on Helen Ster’s face appearing with regular frequency. When I returned from Frankfurt that autumn, Helen Ster looked as though he’d been through battle. I knew Lundlund was an eager, greedy, strong, and cheerful little creature. I understood that after Helen Ster’s birth that autumn, everyone else had taken a back seat. I observed that Lundlund displayed early, vague forms of emotional release. I thought she was trying every way she could to get attention.\n[2008-03-04 07:58:05] studio | I saw that even when she was in good spirits, her hand might flash out to punch him. I noticed that alongside these actions, she would begin to grow angry. I knew things were difficult, realizing we couldn’t completely keep her away from her brother. I understood we had no choice but to try to read her moods and block her access to him. I realized the intensity of her rage was beyond what I could have imagined two months earlier. I thought we must find a way to balance this situation.\n[2008-03-04 07:58:15] studio | I watched her lower her head and turn away, starting to cry, the moment she sensed sternness in my voice or manner. I noticed in her an early, inexplicable fragility. I thought she seemed willing to show us only her anger, while choosing to hide whatever sensitivities lay beneath.\n[2008-03-04 07:58:25] studio | I watched myself quickly get moving, pulling yesterday’s clothes over my body and taking her into the kitchen. The promised blueberry yogurt and muesli awaited her there. Early in the morning, I felt the street outside still pitch dark, the entire house utterly still. I knew I was fulfilling my promise to her. I thought that as I write these words, tenderness for her fills my heart. Yet in reality, I feel a willing yet tense excitement. I see her standing before me, emotionally ready for a new day.\n[2008-03-04 07:58:35] studio | I watched her repeatedly demand to watch a movie or enter the room where her brother slept. I saw that each time I said 'no,' she would defiantly do the opposite. When I spoke sharply to her, I saw tears roll down her cheeks. I saw her lower her head, shoulders slumping as she turned away. I realized that once her behavior crossed the line, my warmth would vanish. I felt we were caught in an endless struggle, my irritation turning to fury. I thought, fine then, let her have it her way—it’s self-inflicted anyway.\n[2008-03-04 07:58:45] studio | I watched myself go through the daily morning routine—diaper changes, dressing, brushing teeth and faces. I saw myself pushing the double stroller with one hand while holding the girls’ hands, entering the elevator. I pushed them out the front door onto the street, delivering them to kindergarten ten minutes later. After five hours of work, I would go pick them up again. I heard the inevitable squabbles and scuffles along the way. I saw that the streets were already filled with people hurrying to work. I knew she was barely two years old. Only at night did I finally understand—I could never stop caring for her. When they were asleep, I wondered what exactly I was doing here. I realized I had no choice but to face the tedious routines of daily household life. I thought: this is my everyday existence.\n[2008-03-04 07:58:55] studio | I realized I always had a strong need for solitude. I found that when I didn’t get space to be alone, I grew disappointed, frustrated, even angry. I thought the driving force of my adult life was the longing to write something extraordinary. I realized that when this desire was threatened, it felt like a mouse gnawing at my heart, making me want to flee.\n[2008-03-04 07:59:05] studio | I watched myself constantly mopping the floor, doing laundry, making dinner, shopping. I watched myself taking the children to play at the amusement park, bathing them, putting them to bed, then continuing to fetch clothes, fold clothes, and tidy up the house. I watched myself endlessly wiping tables, chairs, and cabinets. I felt time flying past me, like sand slipping through my fingers. I thought, what exactly am I doing? I realized these trivial tasks had taken over my entire life.",

I observed the child I cared for and noticed she was more stubborn than any other child I'd ever seen. I felt as though it had once become nothing short of a madhouse. I realized this was a war I couldn't fight. I thought perhaps it was because we failed to achieve balance between closeness and distance. I realized such balance was especially crucial when emotions became hard to control.\n[2008-03-04 07:59:25] studio | I watched Vanya suddenly scream at eight months old, and I saw myself grabbing her until it was over. I saw how this often happened when we visited Grandma in the countryside or made a trip into town. I saw her standing there, screaming with all her might. I heard her shrieking incessantly, screaming loudly, refusing to listen to reason. I knew that when she received too many new impressions from the outside world, this emotional outburst would erupt. As far as I knew, it was impossible to get close to her at such times. I thought it was hard to explain why. I realized that when she screamed uncontrollably, she completely transformed into someone else.\n[2008-03-04 07:59:35] studio | I watched myself losing my mind as anger surged. I saw Vanya lying on the floor in the supermarket in Halvik, refusing to get up. I saw myself lifting her onto my shoulder like a sack of potatoes and carrying her through the city in full public view. I heard her kicking and thrashing on my shoulder, howling like a wild animal. I knew achieving harmony between sensitivity and self-control was no easy task. I thought things had gotten harder after Lundlund was born. I blamed myself for not being wise or measured, realizing my anger and emotions intensified with the situation. I thought in that moment I truly wanted to tear her apart.\n[2008-03-04 07:59:45] studio | I watched myself standing there yelling back at her. I saw myself throwing her onto the bed and pinning her down until she submitted. I saw myself striding toward her, grabbing her and shaking her violently. Finally, I watched her body go limp and begin to accept comfort. I heard her dry, purposeful sobs filled with provocation. I heard myself roaring at her. I knew this was her fear tactic. As far as I knew, she had found, at such a young age, the perfect way to drive me insane. I realized I would completely lose control. I thought this wasn’t ordinary whimpering or hysteria, but a scream designed to drive me mad. I observed that only when her shrieks turned into crying did the situation improve.\n[2008-03-04 07:59:55] studio | I realized for a time, this one issue was the only thing we talked about every single day. I felt my whole life was filled with chaos, as if everything could collapse at any moment. Looking back on this experience, I wondered how a child under two could leave such a mark on life. I realized it was actually about us. I thought Nils Nils and my life were nearly in chaos. I realized we had to force ourselves to adapt to family life because we simply didn’t know how to plan. I sighed, realizing daily dinners and end-of-month bills kept catching us off guard.\n[2008-03-04 08:00:05] studio | I watched how spontaneous moments added fleeting meaning. I saw the children full of energy, seeking joy. I saw that if we took them somewhere fun, they would forget their previous anger completely. I knew life wouldn’t spiral out of control as long as royalties or payments came into the account. I learned there would be follow-up foreign royalties coming this autumn. I realized the fruits of labor made life feel meaningful and bright. I recalled how joyful we truly were back then. I thought that as long as we had extra energy, all conflicts seemed to vanish.\n[2008-03-04 08:00:15] studio | I felt trapped in a swamp of tears and disappointment, dragged downward in endless circles by everything. I realized this was exhausting, and although I knew I should enjoy the moments, they meant little to me. I thought realizing I was dealing with children who pulled me down made me feel worthless. I realized I’d never considered these things before having kids. I thought back then I believed that treating them well would make everything work out—but I hadn’t anticipated how deeply children could invade your life.\n[2008-03-04 08:00:25] studio | I thought I would gain an unprecedented closeness. I realized my own temperament was intertwining with their temperaments, revealing my worst traits, which were then thrown back at me. I realized the same was true for the good and beautiful aspects of human nature. But in difficult times, I discovered children would vent their shaken emotions through misbehavior and tantrums.\n[2008-03-04 08:00:35] studio | I watched the children come close to me when they needed protection. I watched our whole family go on an outing to Sydöstrand on Sunday. I saw them playing for half an hour beside a pile of wood in the park. I saw their great interest in the sailboats out at sea. I watched us sitting on the steps leading down to the water, eating Italian sandwiches. I felt it was a sunny Sunday, the air filled with a magical quality. I knew life there was essentially stable and orderly. I learned those sandwiches were bought from a local Italian café. I thought even though I sometimes lost my temper with them, they still felt safe with me. I realized that for them, even the simplest needs were full of charm. I decided not to worry about the packed lunch anymore.\n[2008-03-04 08:00:45] studio | I saw Vanya running with flailing arms and legs, while Lundlund stumbled along behind her sister. I watched Lundlund fall asleep in the stroller. I saw myself sitting in a café with Vanya, watching her hold a glass of lemonade. I heard Vanya open up, asking a string of questions: whether the sky was firmly hung, or if anything could stop autumn, or whether monkeys had skeletons. I knew Vanya had been running like that since she was one-and-a-half years old. I realized Lundlund was always ready to accept Vanya’s little quirks. I saw them running around and laughing, and felt a sense of peace. I realized Vanya cherished every moment alone with us.\n[2008-03-04 08:00:55] studio | I knew that if I wanted to, we could live in Leivik—skiing in winter, boating in summer—and be an orderly, happy family. Faced with all this, a feeling of pleasure welled up inside me, a calm serenity. I asked myself, isn’t this enough? I realized that if happiness were the goal, then yes, it would be enough. But I thought, happiness has never been my goal, nor has family. I realized I could give everything for my family, yet deep down, I did not wish to live that typical happy life.\n[2008-03-04 08:01:05] studio | I saw how families with children live every day. I saw children clean and neatly dressed. I saw parents cheerful, even when raising their voices never shouting like fools. I saw them going on weekend outings, renting houses in Normandy for summer vacations. I saw them working at banks, hospitals, IT companies, or universities. I thought, this life looks like a cartoon. I noticed their refrigerators were always full. I realized their lives followed such standard, happy trajectories.\n[2008-03-04 08:01:15] studio | I looked at the old stroller the children used, thinking it looked like something pulled from a dumpster. I saw myself on the way to kindergarten, eyes wild, face stiff. I asked myself why I write, shutting myself off from the world. I wondered why writing demands that children behave according to my will, regardless of consequences. I asked myself where the chaos in our lives truly comes from. I realized I could make it all disappear, become that kind of family. I thought, but only if I wanted to, only if that were the ultimate meaning of life. Yet I told myself, I do not want to.\n[2008-03-04 08:01:25] studio | I thought about how I must give everything for my family—that it is my duty. I realized the only thing life has taught me is endurance, never to question it. I didn’t understand where these thoughts came from; I reflected inwardly: why should duty outweigh happiness? I realized that when I see a beautiful oil painting, I can burst into tears, yet I don’t do so when I see my children—but that doesn’t mean I don’t love them. I realized it simply means the meaning they give cannot fill my entire existence.\n[2008-03-04 08:01:35] studio | I thought about how soon I’d be forty, then fifty, sixty, seventy. I sighed inwardly—if it goes on like this, perhaps my epitaph will read: Here lies a man who endured everything, until he was finally crushed to dust.\n[2008-03-04 08:01:45] studio | I thought perhaps the epitaph could instead read: Here lies a man who discovered he never complained about anything, and thus lived only half a life. I imagined my final words before falling down into death: Ah, God, how cold and dull it is here—who can send me a pinch of life’s salt?\n[2008-03-04 08:01:55] studio | I pondered in my heart, or perhaps the epitaph could be like this.\n[2008-03-04 08:02:00] studio | I silently recited those words in my mind: Here lies a writer, a good and gentle man, unfamiliar with laughter, unacquainted with joy, once full of words, now filled with earth. I pictured maggots gnawing at my flesh and those eyes long gone dim.\n[2008-03-04 08:02:10] studio | I thought I still have thirty years ahead of me; it’s hard to say I’ll remain the same as before, so perhaps another possibility exists.\n[2008-03-04 08:02:20] studio | I composed another phrase in my mind: We all belong to you, divine God—take him away, along with his hair and skin. I imagined Grete Lundnes finally dying of old age, the one who once raised his fists at friends for writing books, who wrote, who masturbated, but with poor results, and who ultimately screamed in agony from a heart suffocated by fat, dying like a fish.\n[2008-03-04 08:02:30] studio | I thought there might still be a possibility, if I were lucky, based on my own tiny personal preference.\n[2008-03-04 08:02:40] studio | A sentence surfaced in my mind: Here lies one who smoked in bed with his wife, burned up and soared into the sky. I thought this meant they were no longer here—only their ashes could be found out on the grass outside.\n[2008-03-04 08:03:00] studio | I knew that when my father was my age, he broke free from his former life and began a new chapter. I compared my father’s choices when he was my age.",

I knew Nils Nils’s friend Siv Ingrid had invited us to stay together in her partner’s summer house.\n[2008-07-10 10:00:10] in the car heading to Tjörn Island | I heard us ask her whether she really knew what it meant to live with three children, and whether she truly wanted us to come. But I heard her reply that she did mean it—she had already planned barbecues and crab hunts with the kids so that we could have time alone.\n[2008-07-10 10:00:15] summer house on Tjörn Island | I watched as we accepted her kindness. I drove toward Tjörn Island. I saw us park and move in, filling the house with children and bulky luggage. I noticed that three days later, we packed everything back into the car and left. The summer house came into view, situated in the scenic southern Leivik countryside. I saw that Siv Ingrid and Erik were clearly relieved by our departure.\n[2008-07-10 10:00:30] summer house on Tjörn Island | I realized how difficult it is for people without children to understand what one must deal with—I remembered that I myself had been just like that before having children.\n[2008-07-10 10:00:40] summer house on Tjörn Island | As far as I knew, Siv Ingrid and Erik were both career-driven people. I knew Siv Ingrid’s resume was filled exclusively with top positions in the cultural sector, while Erik was the head of a multinational fund. I understood their lifestyle involved constant travel to places I had only ever heard of.\n[2008-07-11 12:00:00] summer house on Tjörn Island | I saw us storming in like that, carrying baby wipes and diapers. I watched Helen Ster crawl everywhere, Lundlund and Vanja fighting and shouting, crying and laughing. I noticed the children never ate at the table and never listened to adults. I realized the more precarious our situation became, the less disciplined they grew.\n[2008-07-11 12:05:00] Shanen Island summer house | I saw Erik pretending not to care, trying to appear generous and fond of children. I watched him walk around putting various things back in place. I am inside a tall, spacious summer house. I noticed Erik’s arms pressed tightly against his ribs and the dazed look in his eyes. I realized his body language kept betraying him. I understood how he felt and liked him, but I also realized this was all my doing—there could be no mutual affection.\n[2008-07-12 15:00:00] mountain path by the sea | I noticed one day, while walking to the seaside, that he and Vanja went up the hill. I watched him stand idly gazing at the view, letting Vanja climb several meters ahead on her own. I had to sprint with Lundlund in my arms to go rescue her. As far as I know, he studied at Oxford and Cambridge and worked as a broker in Shannest Financial City for several years. I realized he completely failed to consider that Vanja was only four and incapable of assessing risks.\n[2008-07-12 15:30:00] restaurant | I watched us take our seats in a restaurant. I passed a plate of small rolls next to him and asked him to give some to Helen Ster. I saw him nod yes, yet he didn’t put down the newspaper he was reading. I watched Helen Ster grow increasingly agitated until she finally screamed. I heard Helen Ster scream because the bread she wanted was right in front of her but she couldn’t reach it. I felt my legs stiff from the earlier exertion. I noticed he didn’t even look up, completely unaware of Helen Ster’s distress.\n[2008-07-12 16:00:00] outside the restaurant | I watched as we didn’t climb into the car and leave until the next morning. I heard Nils Nils say we should go home now, immediately. I told her to shut up, stay calm, and not make such decisions when she was so angry. I realized the situation had angered Nils Nils—I could see it in her eyes. I’ve grown used to her mood swings. I sensed she became even more furious because of what I said.\n[2008-07-13 10:00:00] inside the car | I watched our entire family squeeze into one car. I saw myself stop by a gate and discover it led to an indoor restaurant belonging to a yacht club. I heard the waiter tell me there was another restaurant about five hundred meters away in town, reachable by crossing the bridge on foot. Before me stretched a cloudless blue sky, and I saw the countryside shaken by strong winds. I felt the children were immersed in joy. I felt this atmosphere eased the earlier tension, but I realized it wouldn’t last long—we’d soon be hungry again.\n[2008-07-13 10:20:00] on the bridge | I watched us mount a high, narrow bridge twenty minutes later, struggling to push two strollers. I felt the fierce wind and saw cars whizzing past me. I noticed Nils Nils was furious, her eyes flashing dangerously. I felt ravenous, yet all I saw before me was an industrial zone.\n[2008-07-13 10:21:00] on the bridge | I heard Nils Nils grit her teeth and say: 'We always mess things up like this. Nobody else does. We’re just useless. We should’ve been eating by now—our whole family could’ve had a proper meal, but instead we’re stuck here in the wind, choking on exhaust fumes on this damn bridge. Has anyone ever seen a family with three kids manage to screw things up this badly?'\n[2008-07-13 10:30:00] industrial area / in front of iron gate | I watched us walk to the end of the road. I saw an iron gate with the logo of a security company engraved on it. The sight of the town looked bleak and desolate. I realized we’d have to detour through this industrial area to reach the town.\n[2008-07-13 10:35:00] industrial area | I watched myself push the strollers back over the bridge, return to the yacht club, stuff them into the car, and drive toward the nearest McDonald's. I thought I should leave her behind—she constantly complains but never tries to change. But then I thought we’d already have gone our separate ways if not for these special circumstances. I realized practical realities tied us together again—we shared one car and two strollers.\n[2008-07-13 11:30:00] McDonald's / gas station | I saw the McDonald's located at a gas station. I sat on a bench inside and ate a sausage. I saw Vanja and Nils Nils eating in the car. I noticed Helen Ster and Lundlund were asleep.\n[2008-07-13 14:00:00] Fairy Tale World Amusement Park | I watched as we abandoned our original plans and stopped at what was called a 'fairy tale world.' I felt that everything here was of the poorest quality imaginable. I thought going to Liseberg Amusement Park would only make things worse, given the atmosphere between us.\n[2008-07-13 14:15:00] Circus Tent | I saw us bringing the children to a small 'circus.' I saw a dog jump through a hula hoop. I watched a stout woman toss hula hoops into the air. I saw a blond man about my age shoot fire toward the ceiling. Before me stood a shabby circus tent. I noticed the fire-breather wore curled shoes, a woman's headscarf, and his belly fat spilling over his baggy pants. I thought any schoolgirl could have done these tricks when I was just starting school.\n[2008-07-13 14:30:00] Circus Tent | I saw Helen Ster and Lundlund watching intently. I noticed Vanja kept asking when the show would end. I watched Nils Nils holding Lundlund on his lap at the side. I heard Vanja repeatedly asking when the performance would end, and she kept pinching me. I saw tears in Nils Nils's eyes. I noticed Vanja’s mind was already on the lottery stall we had passed earlier.\n[2008-07-13 14:45:00] Amusement Park Path | I watched as we exited and walked toward the smaller amusement area. I saw us pass a large swimming pool with a long slide. I watched her ask what was wrong. I asked Nils Nils what was wrong. I noticed a giant Ferris wheel rising behind the top of the slide.\n[2008-07-13 14:45:10] Amusement Park Path | I heard her say, 'I don't know,' then she added, 'But I always get so moved by performances like this.'\n[2008-07-13 14:45:15] Amusement Park Path | I asked, 'Why?'\n[2008-07-13 14:45:20] Amusement Park Path | I heard her tell me, 'Well, it's so sad, so small, so cheap. And yet so beautiful.'\n[2008-07-13 14:45:25] Amusement Park Path | I pressed further, 'Even this one?'\n[2008-07-13 14:45:30] Amusement Park Path | I heard her reply, 'Yes. Didn’t you see Lundlund and Helen Ster? They were completely captivated.'\n[2008-07-13 14:45:35] Amusement Park Path | I laughed as I spoke, then noticed Nils Nils smiling back at me. I told her, 'Vanja didn’t.'",

I noticed that although she was happy, she was also alert, showing a desire to know more.\n[2008-07-13 14:45:55] playground path | I heard Vanja press on, \"What did I do?\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:00] playground path | I answered her, \"You pinched me,\" then added, \"and said you wanted to go to the place where they have the raffle.\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:05] playground path | I heard her ask in confusion, \"Why?\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:10] playground path | I said, \"How should I know?\" Then I added, \"I guess you wanted a toy.\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:15] playground path | I heard her ask eagerly, \"So can we go now?\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:20] playground path | I answered firmly, \"Yes,\" and then said, \"Let's go right over.\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:25] playground path | I pointed toward the asphalt path leading into the playground, thinking we could cut through the little woods.\n[2008-07-13 14:46:30] playground path | I heard Vanja ask, \"Does Lundlund have one too?\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:35] playground path | I heard Nils Nils reply, \"If she wants one, she can have it.\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:40] playground path | I saw Vanja lean down toward Lundlund in the stroller. I heard Vanja say, \"She wants one,\" and then I heard her ask, \"Do you want one, Lundlund?\"\n[2008-07-13 14:46:45] playground path | I heard Lundlund answer firmly, \"Yes.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:00:00] playground | I watched as we had to pay ninety kroner for tickets so each of them could hold a small cloth mouse. I felt the scorching sun; the air beneath the trees seemed motionless. The noisy clamor of the amusement park buzzed around me, mixed with eighties disco music from the stalls, making it feel like everything was closing in on us.\n[2008-07-13 15:10:00] outside the snack stand | I noticed Vanja wanted cotton candy. Ten minutes later, I saw us sitting at a table outside the snack stand. I observed the children shouting angrily because the sugar stuck everywhere. I saw angry wasps stubbornly buzzing around us. I felt the searing sunlight making the sugar stick to everything it touched—tabletops, the back of the stroller, my arms and hands. I found my coffee too bitter to drink. I thought this wasn't at all what I'd imagined when the kids first saw the spiral candies in the big jars at the snack stand.\n[2008-07-13 15:15:00] outside the snack stand | I saw a dirty little boy pedaling a tricycle straight toward us, crashing into Lundlund’s stroller. I noticed he pushed the stroller a few more times with his bike, blocking our way out, then just stood there, eyes fixed on the ground. I saw the boy had black hair and dark eyes. After he hit the stroller, I noticed he looked at us expectantly. I guessed he was probably Romanian or Albanian, maybe Greek.\n[2008-07-13 15:16:00] outside the snack stand | I asked, \"Shall we go?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:16:05] outside the snack stand | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Lundlund wants to ride the horse,\" and then she asked, \"Can’t we stay a bit longer?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:17:00] outside the snack stand | I saw a burly man with prominent ears and a dark complexion approach, lift the boy and his tricycle off to the side, give the boy a couple of pats on the head, and then walk over toward the mechanical octopus he operated. I saw the boy get back on his tricycle and ride across the entrance. I saw the mechanical octopus, its tentacles fitted with small baskets where people could sit, rising and falling as the machine turned. I saw a steady stream of visitors, all dressed in summer clothes.\n[2008-07-13 15:18:00] outside the snack bar | I stood up as I spoke, watching myself toss the leftover cotton candy from Vennia and Lundlund into the trash, then push Helen Ster. I watched his head sway from side to side, catching sight of interesting things. I saw us cross the square and head toward the path leading to 'Cowboy Town'. I said to them, 'Of course.'\n[2008-07-13 15:25:00] Cowboy Town | I saw the Eastern European woman sitting on a rock smoking inside the enclosure facing the mine. Before my eyes lay a pile of sand and three newly built sheds with signs reading 'Mine,' 'Sheriff's Office,' and 'Jail.' I noticed 'Wanted' posters posted on the latter two. On one side stood birch trees and a sloped ramp where some teenagers were skateboarding; on the other side, the horseback riding area was already closed.\n[2008-07-13 15:26:00] Cowboy Town | I noticed Lundlund looking around as he spoke. I heard Lundlund shout, 'Horseback riding!'\n[2008-07-13 15:26:05] Cowboy Town | I heard Nils Nils say to me, 'We have to go ride donkeys at the entrance.'\n[2008-07-13 15:27:00] Cowboy Town | I saw Helen Ster drop his water bottle on the ground. I noticed Vennia crawl under the fence and run toward the mine; Lundlund saw it too and climbed out of the stroller to follow her. I spotted a red-and-white soda machine behind the sheriff’s office, so I fumbled through my shorts pocket—inside were two hair clips, a ladybug hairpin, a lighter, three stones, two white seashells Vennia had found on Sjøen Island, a twenty-kroner bill, two five-kroner coins, and nine one-kroner coins.\n[2008-07-13 15:28:00] Cowboy Town | I pointed toward a log at the far end of the area. I saw Helen Ster raise both arms. I said, 'I'll have a cigarette now,' then added, 'Over there.'\n[2008-07-13 15:28:10] Cowboy Town | I saw Nils Nils speaking while lifting Helen Ster up. I heard Nils Nils say, 'Go ahead.' Then she leaned down and asked Helen Ster, 'Are you hungry, Helen Ster?' Then she complained to me, 'It's so hot. Isn't there any shade where I can sit him down?'\n[2008-07-13 15:28:20] Cowboy Town | I pointed toward the restaurant atop the hill. I told Nils Nils, 'Over there.' Before me rose the train-shaped restaurant on the hilltop—I noticed the counter was set up inside the locomotive, and tables filled the carriages. Not a soul was in sight; chairs were tucked tightly against the tables.\n[2008-07-13 15:28:30] Cowboy Town | I heard Nils Nils say, 'I’ll go over now and feed him. Can you keep an eye on your daughter?'\n[2008-07-13 15:29:00] Cowboy Town / beside the soda machine | I nodded and walked over to the soda machine to buy a can. I sat down on a tree stump, lit a cigarette, and looked up at the hastily built shacks. I noticed Vennia and Lundlund running in and out of the doorway.\n[2008-07-13 15:30:00] Cowboy Town/shack front | I heard Vanya shouting, \"It's pitch-black in here! Come take a look!\"\n[2008-07-13 15:30:10] Cowboy Town/tree stump | I raised my hand and waved toward Vanya. I saw she was still holding the mouse against her chest with one hand. I silently felt relieved that she seemed satisfied with this response. Then it suddenly struck me: Where had Lundlund’s mouse gone?\n[2008-07-13 15:35:00] Cowboy Town/tree stump | I looked up toward the hill. I saw Nils Nils pull a chair over by the wall of the restaurant and begin nursing Helen Ster; I noticed the child first kicking its legs, then growing quiet. I saw the lady from the circus walking uphill. I felt a sting on my calf, slapped backward, and crushed a horsefly so thoroughly it burst. I kept drawing smoke into my lungs, eyes fixed on the spruce treetops. I felt another horsefly land on my leg and impatiently swatted it away. I stood up, tossed my cigarette to the ground, picked up the half-can of cold cola, and walked toward my two daughters. I spotted the mouse there, just outside the police station, headfirst in the sand. I smelled cigarettes baking in the heat. The spruce canopy caught sunlight, revealing an intensely vivid green. In my hand was the half-can of cola, still cold.",

Go around to the back and see if you can peek through a crack, okay?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:40:10] Cowboy Town/behind the shack | I walked around to the back of the shed. I bent down and brought my eye close to a crack to peer inside. I called out, \"Okay.\" Then I heard them making clattering noises inside, giggling wildly. I felt the contrast between the bright sunlight outside and the darkness within was too extreme—I realized I couldn't see anything at all.\n[2008-07-13 15:40:20] Cowboy Town/behind the shack | I heard Vanya shout from inside, \"Dad, are you outside?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:40:25] Cowboy Town/behind the shack | I shouted back, \"Yes.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:40:30] Cowboy Town/behind the shack | I heard a voice from inside ask, \"Can you see us?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:40:35] Cowboy Town/behind the shack | I called out, \"No. Have you turned invisible?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:40:40] Cowboy Town/behind the shack | I heard them shout in unison, \"Yes!\"\n[2008-07-13 15:41:00] Cowboy Town/Shack Front | I saw the two of them come out, but I deliberately pretended not to notice. I stared straight in the direction of Waneya. I shouted Waneya's name loudly.\n[2008-07-13 15:41:10] Cowboy Town/Shack Front | I saw Waneya waving her arms at me. I heard her say: 'I'm here.'\n[2008-07-13 15:41:15] Cowboy Town/Shack Front | I kept shouting toward her: 'Waneya? Where are you? Come out right now! This isn't a joke.'\n[2008-07-13 15:41:20] Cowboy Town/Shack Front | Her voice came from nearby: 'I'm here! Right here!'\n[2008-07-13 15:41:25] Cowboy Town/Shack Front | I shouted her name again loudly: 'Waneya?'\n[2008-07-13 15:41:30] Cowboy Town/Shack Front | I heard Waneya ask with boundless joy: 'You really can't see me? Did I actually turn invisible?' I sensed she sounded extremely happy, yet I also keenly detected a hint of unease in her voice.\n[2008-07-13 15:41:40] Cowboy Town | At that moment, I heard Helen Ster start screaming. I looked up and saw Nils Nils standing up, clutching her tightly in his arms. I realized Helen Ster’s usual crying didn’t sound like this.\n[2008-07-13 15:41:50] Cowboy Town | I feigned surprise and said: 'Oh, there you are! Have you been here all along?'\n[2008-07-13 15:41:55] Cowboy Town | I heard Waneya reply hesitantly: 'Y-yes... yes.'\n[2008-07-13 15:42:00] Cowboy Town | I asked Waneya: 'Can you hear Helen Ster crying?'\n[2008-07-13 15:42:05] Cowboy Town | I saw Vanya nod, then I watched her look toward the mountain restaurant.\n[2008-07-13 15:42:10] Cowboy Town | I said, \"We have to go, come on.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:42:15] Cowboy Town | I reached out my hand, wanting to take Lundlund's hand.\n[2008-07-13 15:42:20] Cowboy Town | I heard Lundlund say to me, \"No, don't hold hands.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:42:25] Cowboy Town | I said, \"Alright then, jump into the stroller.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:42:30] Cowboy Town | I heard her reply, \"No stroller.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:42:35] Cowboy Town | I asked, \"Then should I carry you?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:42:40] Cowboy Town | I heard her sharply refuse, \"Don't carry me.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:00] Cowboy Town | I went down to get the stroller. When I came back, I saw she had already climbed onto the fence. I noticed Vanya was sitting on the ground. I looked up at the hilltop and saw Nils Nils had left the restaurant and was standing on the road looking down; I noticed she was waving one hand toward us. I noticed Helen Ster was still screaming.\n[2008-07-13 15:43:10] Cowboy Town | I heard Vanya say to me, \"I don't want to walk, my legs hurt.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:15] Cowboy Town | I said to Vanya, \"You haven't walked a single step all day—how can your legs hurt?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:20] Cowboy Town | I heard Vanya reply, \"My legs are numb. You have to carry me.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:25] Cowboy Town | I refused, \"No, Vanya, you're being ridiculous. I can't carry you.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:30] Cowboy Town | I heard her insist stubbornly, \"You can.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:35] Cowboy Town | I said to Lundlund, \"Get in the stroller, Lundlund, then we'll go ride horses.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:40] Cowboy Town | I heard her answer, \"No stroller.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:43:45] Cowboy Town | I heard Vanya shriek, \"My legs are numb—!\"\n[2008-07-13 15:44:00] Cowboy Town | I think I felt my temper flaring, wanting to grab both of them and just storm off, one under each arm. I realized it wouldn’t be the first time I’d marched away with them kicking and screaming, and I noticed how I was now ignoring the onlookers’ stares. I thought to myself how they always watched our little scene with immense interest, as if I were wearing a monkey mask or something. But I told myself this time, I had to keep my temper in check.\n[2008-07-13 15:44:10] Cowboy Town | I asked, \"Can you get in the stroller, Vanya?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:44:15] Cowboy Town | I heard her reply, \"Only if you pick me up.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:44:20] Cowboy Town | I said to her, \"No, you have to do it yourself.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:44:25] Cowboy Town | I heard her still refuse, \"No, my legs are numb.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:44:30] Cowboy Town | I thought that if I didn't give in, we'd be standing here until tomorrow morning. I realized that although Vanya usually lacks patience and gives up easily when faced with obstacles, once she sets her mind on something, she becomes extremely stubborn.\n[2008-07-13 15:45:00] Cowboy Town | I watched myself pick her up and place her into the stroller. I gave in and said, \"Alright, you've won again.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:45:10] Cowboy Town | I heard Vanya ask, \"Won what again?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:45:15] Cowboy Town | I watched myself lift her down from the fence. After noticing a few half-hearted 'no, don't's, we started walking uphill. I carried Lundlund and pushed Vanya. I saw myself picking up Lundlund's cloth mouse halfway, brushing off the dirt, and stuffing it into the mesh bag. I said to them, \"Nothing, come on, Lundlund, let's go.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:50:00] Hilltop Restaurant | When we reached the hilltop, I heard Nils Nils say, \"I don't know what's wrong with him—he suddenly started crying. Maybe he was stung by a wasp or something. Look here...\"\n[2008-07-13 15:50:10] Hilltop Restaurant | I watched her pull up Helen Ster's sweater to show me a small red spot. I saw Helen Ster squirming constantly in her arms. Helen Ster’s face, flushed red from constant crying, came into view; I noticed his hair was already soaked.\n[2008-07-13 15:50:20] Hilltop Restaurant | I heard Nils Nils say sympathetically, \"Poor little fellow.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:50:25] Hilltop Restaurant | I said to her, \"I got bitten by a horsefly too—maybe that's why. Let's put him in the stroller so we can move. Anyway, there's nothing we can do right now.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:51:00] Hilltop Restaurant | I watched as we strapped him into the seat, noticing how he still wriggled from side to side, lowering his head in boredom. I heard him whining persistently.\n[2008-07-13 15:51:10] Hilltop Restaurant | I suggested, 'Let's get in the car.'\n[2008-07-13 15:51:15] Hilltop Restaurant | I heard Nils Nils reply, 'Alright, but I need to change his diaper first. There's a baby-changing cabin over there.'\n[2008-07-13 15:52:00] Downhill Path | I nodded, then watched as we began walking downhill. I thought about how we'd already been here for several hours. I looked at the slanting sunlight in the sky and the light filtering through the trees, which inevitably reminded me of summer afternoons back home, when we would either drive off to swim or walk up the slopes by the bay. I realized these memories had flooded my mind within seconds, and I could sense their atmosphere, smells, and feelings.\n[2008-07-13 15:52:10] Downhill Path | I saw how the clear, bright midday light had deepened in the afternoon, saturating everything with rich intensity. I saw sunlight glinting on smooth coastal rocks, almost turning them golden yellow, and noticed stiff, dry grass growing between the stones. I sensed the depth beneath the sea surface, saw how dark it became once shadowed by the mountain. I watched fish dart past. I saw slender branches of the treetop trembling in the wind, noticed the smooth trunks beneath the thin bark, like human legs. I looked at those green plants. I recalled a summer day in the seventies, remembering vividly the sensation of running along forest paths, plunging into the sea, and swimming across to the island of Ylsta.",

    "text": "[2008-07-13 15:55:00] In Front of the Octagonal Wooden Building | I saw Nils Nils gesture toward an octagonal wooden structure with a nod of his head. I heard Nils Nils say to me, 'It's right there—can you wait a moment?'\n[2008-07-13 15:55:05] In Front of the Octagonal Wooden Building | I said, 'We'll take it slow.'\n[2008-07-13 15:56:00] Fairy Tale World | I saw two wooden gnomes carved among the shrubs inside a fence, and realized this was precisely why the place could rightfully be called 'Fairy Tale World'.\n[2008-07-13 15:56:10] Fairy Tale World | I heard Lundlund exclaim, 'Look, Tonttu!' I knew the correct pronunciation was actually 'Tonttu,' meaning gnome.\n[2008-07-13 15:56:20] Fairy Tale World | I knew Lundlund had been obsessed with gnomes for quite some time. As far as I knew, she kept pointing at porches where gnomes appeared, saying 'Tonttu is coming,' even during gift-giving games always specifying their origins. I remembered finding gnome costumes in my wardrobe didn't surprise her at all; we said nothing, she simply shouted 'Tonttu' into the closet. I knew that whenever we encountered an old homeless man with a white beard, she would stand up in her stroller and shout loudly. I thought it was still hard to tell exactly what Tonttu meant to her, since she acted as if my wardrobe were the gnome’s dressing room.\n[2008-07-13 15:57:00] Fairy Tale World | I leaned forward and kissed Lundlund's chubby little cheek.\n[2008-07-13 15:57:05] Fairy Tale World | I heard Lundlund say to me, 'No kissing!'\n[2008-07-13 15:57:10] Fairy Tale World | I heard my own loud laughter.\n[2008-07-13 15:57:15] Fairy Tale World | I asked, 'Then can I kiss you, Waneya?'\n[2008-07-13 15:57:20] Fairy Tale World | I heard Waneya reply firmly, 'No!'\n[2008-07-13 15:58:00] Fairy Tale World | I saw a sparse but continuous stream of people passing by, most wearing shorts, T-shirts, and sandals. I was struck by the astonishing number of overweight people, noticing almost no one was well-dressed.\n[2008-07-13 15:59:00] Fairy Tale World | I heard Lundlund shout joyfully, 'My dad went to jail!'\n[2008-07-13 15:59:05] Fairy Tale World | I saw Waneya turn her head in the stroller.\n[2008-07-13 15:59:10] Fairy Tale World | I heard Waneya correct him, 'No, Dad didn't go to jail!'\n[2008-07-13 15:59:15] Fairy Tale World | I laughed again, then stopped walking.\n[2008-07-13 15:59:20] Fairy Tale World | I said, \"We'll have to wait here for Mom.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:59:30] Fairy Tale World | As far as I know, 'Your dad's in prison' is something kids often say at kindergarten. I realize Lundlund took it as a great compliment and liked bragging about me. I remember Nils Nils saying she once told an old lady the same thing on a bus, and back then I couldn't respond in time because I was at the station with Helen Ster. I think Lundlund must have felt this was something truly impressive.\n[2008-07-13 15:59:40] Fairy Tale World | I lowered my head and wiped the sweat from my forehead with the sleeve of my T-shirt.\n[2008-07-13 15:59:45] Fairy Tale World | I heard Vanja ask, \"Can I buy another ticket, Dad?\"\n[2008-07-13 15:59:50] Fairy Tale World | I replied, \"No, you've already won a toy.\"\n[2008-07-13 15:59:55] Fairy Tale World | I heard Vanja pleading with me, \"Please, Daddy, just one more.\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:00] Fairy Tale World | I turned my head and saw Nils Nils approaching, noticing Helen Ster sitting properly in the stroller. I saw that Helen Ster was wearing a sun hat and looked quite happy.\n[2008-07-13 16:05:10] Fairy Tale World | I asked, \"Is everything okay?\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:15] Fairy Tale World | I heard Nils Nils reply, \"Hmm, I washed the sting with cold water. But he's tired.\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:20] Fairy Tale World | I comforted her, \"He'll fall asleep once we're in the car.\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:25] Fairy Tale World | I heard Nils Nils ask me, \"What time is it, do you think?\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:30] Fairy Tale World | I replied, \"Around four o'clock?\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:35] Fairy Tale World | I heard Nils Nils musing, \"Get home by eight?\"\n[2008-07-13 16:05:40] Fairy Tale World | I responded, \"More or less.\"\n[2008-07-29 11:30:00] Kristianvik Kindergarten | I saw three young female teachers trying every way to coax her, but she refused to get off my lap. So I watched myself sit down on a chair in the corner of the room, placing Vanja on my lap. I noticed the children playing around. When break time came, I saw the teachers set out snacks in the yard. I sat as instructed, ten meters away from everyone else, and I watched myself force an apologetic smile onto my face. In the end, I saw the teacher successfully lure her away from me. I rode home to write something, leaving her behind crying. It took a month before I could finally pick her up and drop her off normally again. I felt the dazzling sunlight outside. As the days passed, I sensed autumn drawing nearer. I thought it would be best to just throw her deep inside and walk away, leaving her to fend for herself—but I realized no one, neither the teachers nor Nils Nils, would tolerate such cruelty. I wasn't surprised by my own social behavior. I wondered, how had she, at only two and a half years old, already learned this kind of thing?\n[2008-07-29 11:40:00] \"Lynx\" Kindergarten | I heard people say it was common for children to go home together. As far as I knew, sometimes in the mornings she still said she didn’t want to go, and occasionally still cried. I learned that when a spot opened up at another kindergarten nearby called \"Lynx,\" we didn’t hesitate. I knew it operated as a parent cooperative, where parents took turns working and handling administration. I understood we didn’t know anyone at Kristianvik. I realized this was a shortcut to building relationships.\n[2008-07-29 11:50:00] Home in Kristianvik | I heard Vanja ask two or three times every hour whether it was time yet, if we should leave. As far as I knew, we had received an invitation to Stella’s birthday party. I saw the invitation placed on the kindergarten bookshelf. I learned Vanja was genuinely looking forward to it, especially because she wanted to wear her golden party shoes. I sensed that although Vanja was excited, she also felt hesitant because she didn’t know the other children well—and didn’t really want to go. I realized it would be an unbearable morning.\n[2008-07-29 12:00:00] Home in Kristianvik | I watched Vanja suddenly jump out of bed and rush to the small cabinet to put on her golden shoes. I saw Nils Nils take her to the bookstore to buy a gift, then sit at the kitchen table to make a greeting card. I watched myself bathe and comb the hair of both daughters, then dress them in white socks and party dresses. I heard us nod and say to her, \"Yes, today we’re going to Stella’s house.\" As far as I knew, that morning had finally arrived.\n[2008-07-29 12:10:00] Home in Kristianvik | I watched Vanja hurl both golden shoes against the wall. But I found we sat patiently, enduring her tantrum for several minutes, then carefully dressing her in all the necessary items. As far as I knew, the white knitted shawl had been given to her by Lundlund at her christening. I noticed Vanja’s mood had suddenly plummeted. I thought she no longer wanted to wear the socks or the dress—or even go to the party at all.\n[2008-07-29 12:20:00] Kristianvik Street | I watched the two little girls climb into the child seats in front of me. I noticed Vanja holding her golden shoe in one hand and the gift in the other. I saw her turn back to speak to us. I saw Lundlund sitting beside her. I sensed their excitement once again. I noticed Vanja looked serious and quiet, yet her lips broke into a smile. I thought these preparations must have made Lundlund feel that something unusual was about to happen.\n[2008-07-29 12:25:00] Kristianvik street | I pushed the stroller past. I saw family after family walking back and forth toward the multistorey car park. I was immersed in the bustling city noise. I saw shoppers carrying bags, and children loitering outside Burger King and McDonald's. I felt the vibration throughout the black car driven by a male immigrant in his twenties, and I heard the low rumble of the engine. I knew the apartment where the party was being held was on our street, just a few hundred meters away.\n[2008-07-29 12:30:00] outside the supermarket | I watched myself pause briefly outside the supermarket. I saw a frail old woman in a wheelchair ringing a bell at my daughters and smiling. On the other side of the entrance, I saw a drug user sitting with a hat in his hand. I noticed there was a cat in his cage. I saw Vanja turn her head toward us. I felt the crowd outside the supermarket. I saw that the old woman was eager to show kindness. I knew this old woman often appeared here around this time. I realized the bell-ringing startled the two little girls.\n[2008-07-29 12:30:10] outside the supermarket | I heard Vanja say: \"When we move to the countryside, I want a cat.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:30:15] outside the supermarket | I saw Lundlund pointing with his finger. I heard Lundlund shout loudly: \"Cat!\"",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 12:31:00] road | I watched myself maneuver the stroller, crossing the curb onto the road, weaving around three slow pedestrians. I hurried forward a few meters, then turned back onto the pavement. I thought they probably believed the sidewalk belonged to them.\n[2008-07-29 12:31:10] pavement | I said to her: \"That might still be quite far off, you know, Vanja.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:31:15] pavement | I heard Vanja say: \"You can't have a cat in an apartment.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:31:20] pavement | I heard Nils Nils chime in: \"Exactly.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:31:30] pavement | I saw her gripping the gift bag tightly with both hands. I realized Vanja was thinking about the future again.\n[2008-07-29 12:32:00] pavement | I glanced at Nils Nils. I asked: \"What was his name again, Stella's dad?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:32:05] sidewalk | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Oh, my mind went blank... Right, Erik, wasn't it?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:32:10] sidewalk | I replied, \"That's right.\" Then I asked, \"What does he do?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:32:15] sidewalk | I heard Nils Nils answer, \"I'm not sure, something to do with design, I think.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:35:00] street | I watched as we passed Gottgruvan. I noticed that Vanja and Lundlund both stretched their necks to peer into the window.\n[2008-07-29 12:35:15] street | I walked along the street. I saw the next shop was a pawnshop. I noticed the one after that sold various small statues and jewelry. The angels and Buddha figures inside caught my eye, and I smelled incense, tea, and soap. I saw posters in the window announcing dates for visiting yoga masters and spiritual mediums. I realized the shop had a 'New Age' vibe.\n[2008-07-29 12:35:30] street | I looked across the street. I saw TABOO, a sex shop tucked into an alley. Dildos and dolls dressed in various casual clothes and lingerie were displayed in the window. I knew there was a clothing store selling budget brands nearby. I realized the sex shop was using its window displays to lure passersby.\n[2008-07-29 12:35:45] street | I passed by that shop. Bergman's handbag and hat shop came into view. As far as I knew, the interior decor and product offerings had remained unchanged since the store opened in the 1940s.\n[2008-07-29 12:36:00] street | I walked past it. The glowing TV screens of Radio City came into sight. I saw prices written on large orange and green cards. I knew this store had just gone bankrupt. I saw all kinds of electronic devices scattered around.\n[2008-07-29 12:36:10] street | I recognized a pattern—the further into this street we went, the cheaper and more suspicious the shops became. I thought this same pattern probably applied to the people who hung around this area.\n[2008-07-29 12:36:20] street | I understood that Halvik’s city center was different from this place. I realized that poverty and misery here were openly visible on the streets. I found that I liked it.\n[2008-07-29 12:37:00] apartment building entrance | I saw Nils Nils stop in front of a door. I heard Nils Nils say, \"This is it.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:37:05] apartment building entrance | I passed by a bingo hall. I saw three pale women in their fifties standing at the entrance smoking.\n[2008-07-29 12:37:15] apartment building entrance | I watched Nils Nils scan the list and press a number. I walked through the doorway. I heard two buses roar past. I was at the apartment building entrance. I felt the noise and vibration from the passing buses.\n[2008-07-29 12:38:00] stairwell | I watched us enter the lobby; I leaned the stroller against the wall. I carried Lundlund as Nils Nils led Vanja up two flights of stairs. I was in a dimly lit stairwell.\n[2008-07-29 12:38:20] apartment doorway | As I came up, I saw the apartment door open and the inside dark. I felt uneasy walking straight in like this; I would have preferred to ring the doorbell, to make our arrival more noticeable.\n[2008-07-29 12:38:30] apartment hallway | Now I was standing in the hallway. I realized that no one had given the slightest attention to our arrival.\n[2008-07-29 12:39:00] apartment hallway | I put Lundlund down and took off her coat. I noticed that Nils Nils started to take off Vanja’s coat too, but she refused—he had to take off her boots first, so she could put on those golden shoes.\n[2008-07-29 12:39:15] apartment hallway | I saw a room on each side of the hallway. I noticed children excitedly playing in one, while some adults stood talking in the other.\n[2008-07-29 12:39:25] apartment hallway | In the hallway leading deeper into the apartment, I saw Erik standing with his back to me, chatting with a couple of parents from kindergarten. I noticed Erik standing in the passageway leading further inside.\n[2008-07-29 12:39:30] apartment hallway | I called out loudly: \"Hello!\"\n[2008-07-29 12:39:40] apartment hallway | I saw that he didn't look back. I placed Lundlund's coat on top of another coat on the chair and then caught Nils Nils's gaze. I noticed she was looking for a place to hang Waninya's coat.\n[2008-07-29 12:39:45] apartment hallway | I heard her ask me, \"Shall we go in?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:39:55] apartment hallway | I felt Lundlund's arms tightly wrap around one of my legs. I picked her up and took a few steps forward. I saw Erik turn around.\n[2008-07-29 12:40:00] apartment hallway | I heard him respond, \"Hi.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:02] apartment hallway | I also said back, \"Hi.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:05] apartment hallway | I heard him greet Waninya instead, \"Hi, Waninya!\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:08] apartment hallway | I saw Waninya turn her face away.\n[2008-07-29 12:40:15] apartment hallway | I looked down and asked Waninya, \"Aren't you going to give Stella your gift?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:20] apartment hallway | I heard Erik call out loudly, \"Stella, Waninya is here!\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:23] apartment hallway | I heard Waninya answer me, \"You give it.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:30] living room | I saw Stella stand up from among a pile of kids on the floor. I noticed she was smiling.\n[2008-07-29 12:40:35] living room | I said to Stella, \"Happy birthday, Stella! Vanja has a present for you.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:40] living room | I looked down at Vanja and asked, \"Do you want to give her the gift?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:43] living room | I heard Vanja insist, \"You give it.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:40:45] living room | I took the gift and handed it to Stella.\n[2008-07-29 12:40:50] living room | I explained to Stella, \"This is from Vanja and Lundlund.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:41:05] living room | I saw Stella tear off the wrapping paper, reveal a book, set it beside the other gifts on the table, then watched her return to the other children. I heard her say politely, \"Thank you.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:41:15] living room | I heard Erik chime in, \"Well, everything okay?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:41:25] living room | I responded to him, \"Fine, fine.\" I could feel my shirt sticking to my chest. I wondered if anyone would notice. I didn't know.\n[2008-07-29 12:41:35] living room | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Nice house—three rooms?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:41:40] living room | I heard Erik answer firmly, \"Yes.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:41:50] living room | He always seemed sharp, as if he had already gained something from whoever he was speaking to. I couldn't quite figure him out; I noticed his faint, tentative smile could be interpreted in three ways: mockery, camaraderie, or hesitation—and I felt any of them would make perfect sense.\n[2008-07-29 12:42:00] living room | I thought that if he were more distinct or forceful in personality, it might have made me anxious. But I realized he was the hesitant type—weak-willed and indecisive—so no matter what he was thinking now, I didn't feel concerned at all.\n[2008-07-29 12:42:10] living room | I saw Vanja standing close to Nils Nils, looking down at the floor. I realized my attention was entirely on Vanja now.\n[2008-07-29 12:42:20] living room | I heard Erik say to me, \"The others are in the kitchen. There's alcohol if you want some.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:42:35] living room | I saw Lundlund had entered the room and was now standing by a shelf, holding a wooden snail. A wooden snail came into view—it had wheels and a string so it could be pulled along.\n[2008-07-29 12:42:45] living room | I nodded toward the two parents in the hallway.\n[2008-07-29 12:42:48] living room | I heard them say, \"Hi.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:43:00] living room | I wondered to myself, what were their names again? Helen Ster or Jacob? And her—Mia, right? No, damn it, I remembered—he was called Robin.\n[2008-07-29 12:43:05] living room | I said hello, \"Hi.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:43:10] living room | I heard him ask me, \"How are you?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:43:15] living room | I replied to them, \"Yes, and how are you?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:43:20] living room | I heard them politely respond, \"All good, thank you.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:43:35] living room | I smiled at them and watched as they smiled back. I noticed Vanja let go of Nils Nils and hesitantly walked into the room where the children were playing.\n[2008-07-29 12:43:45] living room | I watched her stand there for a moment. I thought she seemed about to take some decisive action.\n[2008-07-29 12:43:50] living room | I heard Vanja announce, \"I have golden shoes!\"\n[2008-07-29 12:44:05] living room | I saw her bend down, take off one shoe, lift it into the air, and finally put it back on her foot. I realized she had planned this to show everyone clearly, but I noticed no one was watching. I saw her notice it too, and then she simply put the shoe back on.\n[2008-07-29 12:44:15] living room | I said to Vanja, \"Don't you want to play with the kids over there? Did you see, they have a big dollhouse?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:44:25] living room | I saw her go as I suggested, sit down beside them, but I noticed she didn’t do anything—just sat and watched.",

I saw myself follow along.\n[2008-07-29 12:45:15] kitchen | I watched as we sat down along the long table, and I took a seat next to the window. I heard everyone greeting each other, and I returned their greetings.\n[2008-07-29 12:45:45] kitchen | I heard them talking about cheap airline tickets, complaining that they initially seemed incredibly low-priced, but gradually became more expensive as one fee after another was added, until the final price ended up being almost the same as those of airlines with higher base rates.\n[2008-07-29 12:46:00] kitchen | I noticed their conversation shifting topics—first to purchasing carbon dioxide emission allowances, then to newly established tourist trains.\n[2008-07-29 12:46:20] kitchen | I sat there idle, nodding at whatever I heard, smiling when others smiled, as I always did. I thought I could certainly offer an opinion here, but I didn't. I realized small talk was one of countless skills I hadn't mastered. Inwardly, I sighed, wishing with all my being that I were thousands of miles away.\n[2008-07-29 12:46:35] kitchen | I saw Stella’s mother, Frida, preparing some kind of salad dressing at the kitchen counter. I was in the kitchen; Frida was busy at the counter.\n[2008-07-29 12:46:50] kitchen | As far as I knew, she had already broken up with Erik, though I understood they could cooperate well when it came to matters concerning Stella. Still, I had noticed that during kindergarten committee meetings, I occasionally sensed tension and irritation between them.\n[2008-07-29 12:47:05] kitchen | I thought about how she was a blonde, high-cheekboned, small-eyed, slender woman who knew how to dress. But I realized she was too pleased with herself, too self-centered, so I didn’t find her attractive at all.\n[2008-07-29 12:47:25] kitchen | I reflected that I held no prejudice against boring people or those who merely echoed others—I realized they might possess more important qualities like passion, thoughtfulness, or kindness. Yet I felt that when confronted with someone both dull and boastful, I experienced something close to physical revulsion.\n[2008-07-29 12:47:40] kitchen | I watched her place a flat bowl onto a tray. Before me lay the flat bowl, alongside a plate of carrot sticks and one of cucumber sticks. I realized the bowl contained only dip, not the sauce I had previously assumed.\n[2008-07-29 12:47:55] kitchen | I saw Vanja enter the room. I observed how, upon seeing us, she walked over and stood very close by.\n[2008-07-29 12:48:00] kitchen | I heard her say gently to me, \"I want to go home.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:48:05] kitchen | I said to her, \"We just got here!\"\n[2008-07-29 12:48:15] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Let's stay a bit longer. Look, now you've got something good to eat!\"\n[2008-07-29 12:48:25] kitchen | I wondered—was she referring to the vegetables on the tray? I was certain she was. Inwardly, I thought this country had gone mad.\n[2008-07-29 12:48:35] kitchen | I said to Vanja, \"I'll go with you. Let's go.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:48:40] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils ask me, \"Can you take Lundlund along too?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:49:00] the room where the children stayed | I nodded, picked up Lundlund, and walked into the room where the children stayed. I saw Vanja following behind me.\n[2008-07-29 12:49:15] the room where the children stayed | I watched as Frida then came in carrying the tray, and I noticed she placed it on a small table in the center of the floor.\n[2008-07-29 12:49:25] the room where the children stayed | I heard Frida say, \"Here's some food for you. The cake will come later.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:49:40] the room where the children stayed | I saw the children—three girls and one boy—continuing to play with the dollhouse; in another room, I noticed two boys running around wildly. I watched the scene inside—the children playing and running about.\n[2008-07-29 12:49:50] living room | I saw Erik standing next to the stereo, and I noticed he was holding a CD.\n[2008-07-29 12:50:00] living room | I heard Erik say to me, 'I've got some Leivik jazz here—do you like jazz?'\n[2008-07-29 12:50:05] living room | I replied hesitantly, 'Uh... yeah, sure.'\n[2008-07-29 12:50:10] living room | I heard Erik say, 'Leivik does jazz pretty well.'\n[2008-07-29 12:50:15] living room | I asked, 'Who's this one?'\n[2008-07-29 12:50:25] living room | I watched him show me the cover. I realized it was a band I'd never heard of before.\n[2008-07-29 12:50:30] living room | I responded, 'That's great.'\n[2008-07-29 12:50:45] children's room | I saw Vanja standing behind Lundlund, trying to pick her up while Lundlund clearly showed she didn't want to be held.\n[2008-07-29 12:50:55] children's room | I spoke up, 'She doesn't want to, Vanja—put her down.'\n[2008-07-29 12:51:05] children's room | I saw Vanja still insisting on holding her, so I watched myself walk over toward them.\n[2008-07-29 12:51:10] the room where the children stayed | I asked Vanya, \"Don't you want to eat carrots?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:51:13] the room where the children stayed | I heard Vanya reply firmly, \"No.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:51:30] the room where the children stayed | I walked over to the table, took a carrot stick, watched myself dip it into the white sauce—probably cream-based—and then put it in my mouth. I said to Vanya, \"There's still some dip over here.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:51:35] the room where the children stayed | I said while chewing, \"Mmm, this is good.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:51:50] the room where the children stayed | I wondered to myself why they couldn't just prepare sausages, ice cream, and soda for the kids? Or lollipops, jelly, chocolate pudding—something like that?\n[2008-07-29 12:52:20] the room where the children stayed | I thought bitterly, damn it, what an ignorant and backward country! I noticed all the young women drinking large amounts of water—I suppose they believe it's healthy, but to me it only seems to be boosting incontinence statistics. I saw children eating hard-to-digest whole wheat pasta and brown rice, and realized they cared only about so-called 'hygiene.' I sighed at how they confused food with morality, believing that eating well makes one a better person, without understanding the difference between dietary ideals. I knew if I voiced such thoughts, I'd instantly be labeled a reactionary from ten years ago or just another Leivik fool.\n[2008-07-29 12:52:30] the room where the children stayed | I heard Vanya mutter, \"I don't want to eat. I'm not hungry.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:52:45] the room where the children stayed | I said to Vanya, \"Alright, alright, but look here. Have you seen this before? It's a model railway. Want to build it together?\"\n[2008-07-29 12:53:30] the room where the children stayed | I saw Vanya nod, and then I watched myself sit down with her behind the other children. I began arranging the tracks in arcs and helping Vanya find the pieces.\n[2008-07-29 12:54:00] the living room | I saw Lundlund had gone into another room; I watched her walking along the bookshelf, examining everything on it. I noticed that whenever the two boys got too loud, she would turn around completely and glare at them.\n[2008-07-29 12:54:30] living room | I saw Erik finally put in the CD and turn up the volume. I heard a blend of piano, bass, and countless percussion instruments filling my ears. I realized that certain kinds of jazz drummers enjoy exactly this—something like striking stone against stone, or just hitting whatever is at hand.\n[2008-07-29 12:54:45] living room | I felt indifferent to it sometimes, and other times I found it utterly absurd. I realized I hated audiences clapping and cheering at jazz concerts.\n[2008-07-29 12:55:00] living room | I saw Erik nodding along to the music, then noticed he turned around, winked at me, and walked into the kitchen.\n[2008-07-29 12:55:15] apartment doorway | I saw Linus and his son Achilles appear at the door. At that moment, I heard the doorbell ring.\n[2008-07-29 12:55:30] apartment doorway | I noticed a piece of chewing tobacco tucked under Linus’s lower lip. He was wearing black trousers and a black jacket over a white shirt, his blond hair slightly messy. I watched him look into the apartment, his gaze honest and innocent.\n[2008-07-29 12:55:35] apartment doorway | I heard Linus say to me, 'Hey! How's it going?'\n[2008-07-29 12:55:40] apartment doorway | I responded to Linus, 'Fine, how about you?'\n[2008-07-29 12:55:45] apartment doorway | I heard Linus reply, 'Alright, same old routine.'\n[2008-07-29 12:56:00] apartment doorway | I watched Achilles as he took off his coat and shoes, his eyes fixed on the children behind me. I noticed how small he was, with large, dark eyes.",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 12:56:15] living room | I saw Vanja staring at Achilles too, and thought that children are just like dogs—they always tend to stick together. I realized Achilles had become the playmate Vanja chose to replace Alexander, and her favorite one at that.\n[2008-07-29 12:56:30] living room | I saw Achilles head straight for the other children as soon as he took off his coat, and I noticed Wanja was powerless to stop him.\n[2008-07-29 12:56:45] kitchen | I saw Linus slip into the kitchen. I think I caught a gleam in Linus's eyes—perhaps it was just from the longing to have someone to talk to.\n[2008-07-29 12:57:15] living room | I saw Lundlund standing by the yucca plant beneath the window, and I noticed she was pulling soil out of the pot, already making a small pile on the floor.\n[2008-07-29 12:57:45] living room | I went over, picked up Lundlund, scooped the soil back into the pot with both hands as best I could, then walked into the kitchen to look for a cloth.\n[2008-07-29 12:58:00] kitchen | I saw Wanja follow me into the kitchen, and as soon as she entered, she climbed onto Nils Nils's lap.\n[2008-07-29 12:58:15] living room | I noticed Nils Nils gave me an inquiring look. I heard Lundlund crying in the living room.\n[2008-07-29 12:58:25] kitchen | I said to Nils Nils, \"I'll take care of her, I just need to find something to wipe the floor with.\"\n[2008-07-29 12:59:15] bathroom | I saw everyone gathered around the workbench preparing food. I didn't push my way in, but instead went to the bathroom. I tore off a long strip of toilet paper and wet it under the tap, then returned to the living room to wipe the floor.\n[2008-07-29 13:00:00] bathroom | I picked up the still-crying Lundlund and carried her into the bathroom to wash her hands at the sink.\n[2008-07-29 13:00:15] bathroom | I finished washing Lundlund's hands. I comforted Lundlund, saying, \"There, there, good girl, all better now. Just a little bit left. Okay, all done!\"\n[2008-07-29 13:00:35] living room | I saw that she had stopped crying when we came out of the bathroom, but she didn't seem happy at all and refused to walk on her own. I realized she just wanted me to carry her now.\n[2008-07-29 13:00:50] living room | I saw Robin standing in the living room with his arms crossed. I noticed Robin was watching his daughter Teresa's every move. I knew Teresa was only a few months older than Lundlund, but as far as I knew, she could already speak in long sentences.\n[2008-07-29 13:01:00] living room | I heard Robin ask me, “Hmm, still writing then?”\n[2008-07-29 13:01:05] living room | I replied to Robin, “Yes, a little bit.”\n[2008-07-29 13:01:10] living room | I heard Robin ask, “You write at home?”\n[2008-07-29 13:01:15] living room | I answered Robin, “Yes, I have my own room.”\n[2008-07-29 13:01:30] living room | I heard Robin ask curiously, “Isn’t it hard? I mean, don’t you ever think about stopping for a while—watching TV, or doing some laundry or something?”\n[2008-07-29 13:01:45] living room | I explained to Robin, “It’s actually good this way. If I had an office, I’d have less time, but…”\n[2008-07-29 13:01:50] living room | I heard Robin respond, “Yeah, sure, of course.”\n[2008-07-29 13:02:05] living room | Robin’s long, golden hair caught my eye, curling over the back of his neck. I saw his bright blue eyes, flat nose, and broad jaw. I noticed that Robin wasn’t particularly sturdy, nor was he slender.\n[2008-07-29 13:02:20] living room | I looked at his appearance and thought he seemed about twenty-five or twenty-six, though I knew he was actually nearly forty. I realized I couldn't tell what he was thinking, but to me, he didn't seem mysterious.\n[2008-07-29 13:02:35] living room | Although he gave me an impression of frankness, I sensed there was something else about him—something like a shadow.\n[2008-07-29 13:03:00] living room | As far as I knew, his job involved helping refugees integrate into society—a fact he had mentioned to me before. I recalled asking him a few questions about how many refugees were granted permission to stay. I then dropped the subject, realizing my opinions and sympathies probably differed greatly from the standards I imagined he held, and that difference would eventually show. I knew I’d come across as either foolish or malicious, and I saw no reason to undermine myself.\n[2008-07-29 13:03:15] living room | I saw Vanja sitting on the floor, looking in our direction. I noticed she was slightly apart from the other children.\n[2008-07-29 13:03:45] living room | I put Lundlund down and saw Vanja get up, walk over, take Lundlund’s hand, lead her to the toy shelf, and hand her a wooden snail. I noticed that if you pulled the wooden snail along the floor, its two antennae would buzz and spin. I observed that Vanja seemed to have been waiting for me to do exactly that.\n[2008-07-29 13:04:05] living room | I saw Vanja take the snail from Lundlund’s hands and place it on the floor. I heard Vanja say: \"Look, Lundlund! You pull the string like this. Then it turns. See?\"\n[2008-07-29 13:04:10] living room | I saw Lundlund grab the string and yank it, causing the snail to flip over.\n[2008-07-29 13:04:15] living room | I heard Vanja say: \"No, not like that—watch me.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:04:25] living room | I saw Vanja right the snail and slowly pull it along for a few meters.\n[2008-07-29 13:04:30] living room | I heard Vanja exclaim loudly: \"I have a little sister!\"\n[2008-07-29 13:04:40] living room | I saw Robin had walked over to the window and was standing there looking out at the backyard.\n[2008-07-29 13:04:50] living room | I thought Stella was full of energy, seemingly with extra vitality, because I knew this was her party.\n[2008-07-29 13:05:15] living room | I saw Stella pointing at one of the two younger girls, asking her to hand over the doll she was holding, then pulling over a little wagon, placing the doll inside, and pushing it down the hallway. I heard Stella excitedly shouting something I couldn't understand.\n[2008-07-29 13:05:35] living room | I saw Achilles spot Benjamin. As far as I knew, Benjamin was a boy one and a half years older than Vanja. I understood that he usually sat somewhere, completely absorbed in a drawing, a pile of Lego bricks, or a pirate ship with plastic pirates.\n[2008-07-29 13:06:00] living room | I saw Benjamin now sitting together with Achilles, building the railway track that Vanja and I had left behind. I thought he seemed imaginative, independent, and well-behaved.\n[2008-07-29 13:06:15] living room | I saw the two younger girls chasing after Stella and heard Lundlund whimpering. I thought she was probably hungry.\n[2008-07-29 13:06:30] kitchen | I walked into the kitchen and sat down beside Nils Nils.\n[2008-07-29 13:06:40] kitchen | I said to Nils Nils, \"Could you go check on them? I think Lundlund is hungry.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:06:50] kitchen | I saw Nils Nils nod, felt her pat my shoulder, and then she got up.\n[2008-07-29 13:07:15] kitchen | I realized it took me several seconds to grasp the topics of the conversations going on at the table: one about a car cooperative, the other about cars. I guessed they had already started talking past each other.\n[2008-07-29 13:07:35] kitchen | I noticed the wrinkles on these Mochengdao faces vanishing into the darkness by the table, saw their eyes flickering in the candlelight.\n[2008-07-29 13:07:50] kitchen | I saw Erik and Frida, and a woman standing by the workbench preparing food. Before me were their backs turned toward us. I realized I couldn't remember the woman's name.\n[2008-07-29 13:08:00] kitchen | I felt my heart fill with tenderness for Vanja. But I realized there was nothing I could do.\n[2008-07-29 13:08:20] kitchen | I watched the person speaking, offered a faint smile at each witty remark, and sipped the red wine someone had placed before me.\n[2008-07-29 13:08:40] kitchen | Before me sat the man directly across the table. I saw he had a large face, scarred cheeks, rugged features, and piercing eyes. I noticed his two hands resting on the table were enormous. I felt he was the only one who made a striking impression.\n[2008-07-29 13:08:55] kitchen | I observed that he wore a 1950s-style shirt, blue jeans rolled up to his calves. I noticed his hairstyle was also typical of the 1950s, and he had sideburns.\n[2008-07-29 13:09:10] kitchen | I felt it wasn't his appearance that set him apart, but his presence. I could sense this man's strong aura even though he hadn't spoken much.\n[2008-07-29 13:09:20] kitchen | As far as I knew, I had attended a party in Halvik back in 2004. I recalled that a boxer had also been at that party.\n[2008-07-29 13:15:00] kitchen | I felt the man sitting across from me radiated the same presence as the boxer from Halvik. I realized it had nothing to do with height or muscle mass, because although I saw several men here with strong builds, they affected me little. I realized that whenever I touched upon certain thoughts, the feeling worsened, and I saw myself still as that fragile, bound man, living in the world of words.\n[2008-07-29 13:15:30] kitchen | I sat there deep in thought, occasionally stealing glances at him, while half-listening to the others' endless conversation. I was sinking into deep thought.\n[2008-07-29 13:16:00] kitchen | I heard the conversation had turned to various teaching methods and which schools people were considering for their children. I caught snippets of Linus talking about a school sports day he'd attended, and then the talk shifted to housing prices.\n[2008-07-29 13:16:30] kitchen | I saw Linus turn his face toward me. I heard a general consensus that house prices had skyrocketed in recent years, but that Halvik had risen even more than here, and perhaps a price drop was only a matter of time.\n[2008-07-29 13:16:35] kitchen | I heard Linus ask me, \"How are house prices in Leivik?\"\n[2008-07-29 13:16:45] kitchen | I answered Linus, \"About the same as here, roughly. Birren and Halvik are equally expensive. Other provinces are cheaper.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:17:00] kitchen | I saw his gaze linger on my face for a moment, and I noticed that once he realized I had nothing more to say, he turned away and rejoined the conversation. I thought his pause just now was waiting for me to expand on the topic he’d handed me.",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 13:17:30] kindergarten meeting room | I learned that Linus believed the point of the meeting was for everyone to speak, because that was the true spirit of a parent cooperative. I recalled that he’d done exactly the same thing at our first general assembly. I thought that back then, since neither Nils Nils nor I had spoken by the end of the meeting, his words had indeed carried a subtle note of criticism.\n[2008-07-29 13:18:00] kindergarten meeting room | I saw Nils Nils speaking on behalf of our family, analyzing pros and cons. I noticed a slight flush on her face and saw that all eyes in the room were fixed on her. I understood that this speech was taking place while I myself didn’t know what to say. I realized I didn’t know what to say about the matter being discussed.\n[2008-07-29 13:18:30] kindergarten meeting room | As far as I knew, the first agenda item was whether the kindergarten should let go of its current cook and instead outsource meals to a cheaper catering company. I learned the second issue concerned food options: vegetarian or standard meals.\n[2008-07-29 13:19:00] kindergarten meeting room | I knew that Lynx was originally founded as a vegetarian kindergarten, built on that principle. But since currently only four parents were vegetarians, and many children weren't eating much of the varied vegetarian offerings, a lot of parents felt it might be time to abandon that principle.\n[2008-07-29 13:20:00] kindergarten meeting room | I understood the discussion lasted for several hours. I knew the way the catering company prepared sausages was a contentious point. I thought the debate dragged across the topics like a trawl net along the seabed. I wondered, how could you ever know how much meat was really in those catering company sausages?\n[2008-07-29 13:20:30] kindergarten meeting room | I knew that for me, a sausage was just a sausage. I realized I couldn't understand how someone could delve so deeply into it. I thought to myself, isn't it nice that the children have a chef cooking in their own kitchen? I thought it, but didn't say it out loud.\n[2008-07-29 13:21:00] kitchen | I saw Linus fix us with his sharp, innocent gaze. I prayed silently that we wouldn't have to speak, and that the whole discussion would just end.\n[2008-07-29 13:21:15] kitchen | I heard Lundlund crying from the living room.\n[2008-07-29 13:21:30] kitchen | I thought of Vanya again. I remembered that her usual way in such situations was to do exactly what others did: if someone pulled out a chair or sat down, she would copy; if someone laughed, she would laugh too, even if she didn't understand why. I realized this was her method.\n[2008-07-29 13:22:00] kindergarten | I heard Stella say, 'You just copy us! You're a parrot! A parrot!' I learned that Vanya's method had been exposed by Stella. I knew that later, Vanya repeated the same words to Lundlund. I thought this mimicry had once been publicly called out by Stella, but I realized it hadn't stopped her from continuing. I found that Vanya understood the subtlety of it.\n[2008-07-29 13:23:00] kindergarten | As far as I knew, Stella was a year and a half older than Vanya, and I knew Vanya admired her most. I understood that Stella held influence over all the children in the kindergarten. I thought Vanya could only be a follower by Stella's grace.\n[2008-07-29 13:23:30] kindergarten | As far as I knew, she was a pretty child, with blonde hair and big eyes, dressed in striking clothes. I realized that the bit of cruelty in her was neither worse nor better than that of other children at the top of the hierarchy. I realized this wasn't why I disliked her.\n[2008-07-29 13:24:00] kindergarten | I realized that for me, the problem was that she was too aware of her influence over adults. I recalled during my time working at the kindergarten, I saw that I never fell for her act. I noticed she was puzzled by my indifference, watching her launch her charm offensive at me.\n[2008-07-29 13:25:00] park | I saw her and Vanya sitting side by side in the double stroller. I noticed I was holding Lundlund in one arm and pushing the stroller with the other. I recalled one time after kindergarten, when Stella came with us to the park.\n[2008-07-29 13:25:30] park | I saw Stella jump out of the stroller a few hundred meters from the park. I watched myself call her back. I heard myself tell her to sit properly in the stroller. I heard myself snap, 'There are cars everywhere—can't you see?' I found myself reacting strongly to her behavior.\n[2008-07-29 13:26:00] park | I saw her looking at me in surprise. I watched her until the next morning when we set off to leave. I thought she wasn't used to that tone. I realized that although I wasn't satisfied with my way of handling things, saying just a 'no!' wasn't exactly the worst thing possible. I found that she resented me for it.\n[2008-07-29 13:27:00] park | I saw myself grabbing their feet and spinning them around in the air. I saw them knocking me down on the grass. I saw Stella kick me on the shin. I heard them burst into loud laughter. I heard myself say to Stella: 'It hurts, really hurts—don't kick me again, Stella.' I saw how much joy these games brought them. I noticed that Stella kicked me several times.\n[2008-07-29 13:28:00] park | I saw Stella kick me once more. I watched myself stand up and grab Stella's small waist, making her stand straight. I heard Vanya laugh too. I realized, of course, she wouldn't listen to those words—I thought this situation had already excited her. I noticed that Vanya, who always imitated her, started laughing as well.\n[2008-07-29 13:28:30] park | I looked into her eyes. I heard myself say sternly to Stella: 'Listen, Stella, if I say no, then it's no. Do you understand?' I realized I really wanted to say 'Listen, you little brat,' but I didn't say it to avoid trouble. I felt that my tone was clearly displeased.\n[2008-07-29 13:29:00] park | I saw her lowering her head, refusing to answer. I watched myself lift her chin. I saw myself walk toward the bench. I heard myself ask again: 'Do you understand?' I heard myself say: 'I'm going to sit on that bench over there. You two play by yourselves until your mom comes.'\n[2008-07-29 13:30:00] park | I saw Vanya give me a puzzled look. I watched Stella and Vanya run off together toward the big 'train'. I thought Vanya must have been used to such scenes. I sensed that Stella immediately put the incident behind her. I realized I had just been skating on thin ice.\n[2008-07-29 13:30:30] park | I saw her mother hand me a cup of coffee. I watched myself sit down. I observed the children playing. I heard her mother chattering about her work. I felt the November sunlight was somewhat glaring, so I squinted my eyes. I learned that when Stella’s mother came to pick her up, she was holding a latte. I realized that because she handed me coffee, I had no choice but to sit down.\n[2008-07-29 13:32:00] kindergarten | I watched myself dressing, undressing, changing diapers, or playing games with the children at the kindergarten. As far as I know, during that week I worked at the kindergarten, I saw myself behaving like a regular office worker. I knew I had prior experience working in public institutions. I thought the teachers weren't used to seeing parents like me. I realized I wasn't a novice when it came to these little tasks.\n[2008-07-29 13:32:00] kindergarten | I saw a thin, small boy with white hair constantly trying to climb onto my lap. I watched him sitting there motionless on my legs. I heard him nagging me to tell him a story. I learned that he didn’t have a single friend there and always wandered around aimlessly.\n[2008-07-29 13:33:00] kindergarten | I watched myself playing pirate ship with one child. I saw myself continuously adding features like sharks, raiding boats, and fire. I learned that all the other children had left and his mother was late. I saw the child overjoyed. I thought he had completely forgotten that his mother hadn't come.\n[2008-07-29 13:34:00] kindergarten | I saw the third boy snatch a bunch of my keys while we were eating. I watched how he looked after taking them. I learned he was the oldest child in the class. I realized he immediately noticed my weakness. I thought I hadn't corrected his behavior in time, which only encouraged him to go further.\n[2008-07-29 13:36:00] kindergarten | I heard him ask if I had car keys. I heard myself reply that I didn't own a car and didn't have a driver's license. I heard him mock, 'You can't drive? Aren't you an adult? All adults can drive, right?'\n[2008-07-29 13:37:00] kindergarten | I saw him jingle the bunch of keys right before my eyes. I watched him grow even more energetic. I heard him say, 'I took your keys, you can't get them back.' I thought he would soon grow bored, but I noticed he didn't stop.\n[2008-07-29 13:38:00] kindergarten | I saw myself suddenly reach out to grab the keys. I watched him pull them away just in time and laugh. I saw him keep slamming the keys onto the table. I saw him continue shaking them in his hand. I heard him mock, 'Hahaha, you can't reach!' I heard myself say, 'Don't do that.' I heard him say, 'You'll never reach them.' I noticed the teachers and other children were all watching us. I tried not to appear furious. I realized I shouldn't have lunged like that—it only made him more triumphant. I noticed I was blushing over such a trivial matter.\n[2008-07-29 13:39:00] kindergarten | I saw him still shamelessly laughing and refusing to stop. Then I noticed Wanja suddenly spoke up. I heard myself say, 'Don't do that.' I know this incident occurred at kindergarten on May 10, 2008.\n[2008-07-29 13:39:05] kindergarten | I heard Wanja shout loudly, 'Give the keys back to Dad!' As far as I know, this was a scene that took place in kindergarten.\n[2008-07-29 13:39:15] kindergarten | I learned this was an unexpected incident during a classroom activity. I wondered to myself, what was going on?\n[2008-07-29 13:40:00] kindergarten | I watched myself pretend nothing had happened and bury my head in my meal again. I saw that little bully keep tormenting me, the jingling noise filling my ears. After drinking some water, I realized I was inexplicably blushing over such a small thing. As far as I know, it was a chaotic lunchtime. I decided in my mind to let him keep the keys for now—deal with it after finishing my meal. I realized I was blushing from embarrassment.\n[2008-07-29 13:41:00] kindergarten | I saw Jork immediately comply, returning the keys to me without any delay. I heard Principal Olaf order Jork to give me back the keys. I know the man named Olaf is the principal here. I wondered if Principal Olaf had seen what happened?\n[2008-07-29 13:42:00] kindergarten | I thought that throughout my adult life, I've always kept a distance from others—that's been my way. I realized that in the world of thoughts and emotions, I've become incredibly close to others, yet I believed that whenever I experienced inner emotional outbursts, they would simply turn away in contempt.\n[2008-07-29 13:43:00] kindergarten | I thought this closeness also reflected my relationship with children, and I realized I could sit down and play with them. I thought that because they lack the polite façade of adults, they can freely pierce through the barriers of my personality. I realized that when this happens, my only defense is to pretend not to care, but I know I'm terrible at it. I thought the children would immediately notice how uneasy I really am in their presence.\n[2008-07-29 13:43:30] kindergarten | I sighed inwardly—oh, what a complete lack of dignity!\n[2008-07-29 13:44:00] kindergarten | I thought everything had suddenly been turned upside down. I, who originally just wanted to work quietly and avoid close relationships, now had to spend a whole week working here. I realized I’d have to chat with parents during drop-offs and pickups or play with the children, and the thought of doing this every day for a whole week filled me with helplessness.\n[2008-07-29 13:45:00] kindergarten | I watched myself trying to hurry, quickly picking up Vanja and putting her coat on. I saw myself sitting on a low, deep sofa. I felt the impolite children pulling and tugging at me. I heard myself constantly agreeing with others about something. Around me was the kindergarten hallway, filled with an atmosphere of social awkwardness. I learned that York’s father is Gustav, a kind and book-loving banker. I realized I kept getting trapped in awkward moments in the hallway. I thought nobody was truly interested in me. I figured York simply enjoyed poking me with sharp things.",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 13:46:00] kitchen | I realized that squeezing at the table among others, eating vegetables while wearing a forced yet polite smile throughout Saturday, was part of the same obligation.\n[2008-07-29 13:47:00] kitchen | I saw Erik take a stack of plates from the overhead cabinet above the counter, and noticed Frida counting forks and knives. I took a small sip of wine. I felt empty inside, acutely aware of how hungry I was.\n[2008-07-29 13:47:15] hallway | I saw Stella stop in the hallway. I heard Stella shout, “Can we eat cake now?” Her flushed face came into view, and I noticed tiny beads of sweat on it.\n[2008-07-29 13:47:25] kitchen | I saw Frida turn toward her. I heard Frida say, “Almost, sweetheart. We need to eat some real food first.”\n[2008-07-29 13:47:40] kitchen | I heard her turn to the people by the table and say, “The food is ready, help yourselves. Plates and utensils are over there. Feel free to get something for the kids too.”\n[2008-07-29 13:47:55] kitchen | I saw Linus stand up after speaking. I heard Linus say, “Ah, food! What do we have?”\n[2008-07-29 13:48:30] kitchen | I got up and walked into the kitchen. I saw Linus coming back with food. Before me were beans, salad, couscous, and what I guessed was a hot casserole of chickpeas. I thought about how I had originally planned to sit a while longer, waiting until the line was gone.\n[2008-07-29 13:48:45] kitchen | I saw Nils Nils holding Lundlund and chatting with Mia, while Vanja hugged her around both legs. I told Nils Nils, \"The food is over there.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:48:50] kitchen | I suggested, \"Shall we switch?\"\n[2008-07-29 13:49:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils say, \"Yes, great, I'm starving.\" I realized she was suffering from extreme hunger at that very moment.\n[2008-07-29 13:49:05] kitchen | I heard Vanja tilt her face up and ask, \"Can we go home now, Dad?\"\n[2008-07-29 13:49:15] kitchen | I said to her, \"But we're going to eat now, and there's cake later too. Shall I get you some food?\"\n[2008-07-29 13:49:18] kitchen | I heard her reply stiffly, \"I don't want anything to eat.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:49:30] kitchen | I took Lundlund's arm and led her away. I said to them, \"I'll still get you something. You come with me.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:49:40] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils ask me, \"Can you take Lundlund along too?\"\n[2008-07-29 13:49:45] kitchen | I heard Mia say, \"Come on, Teresa, let's go get you something to eat.\"\n[2008-07-29 13:50:30] kitchen | I followed them, picked up Lundlund, and joined the line. I saw unfamiliar faces and felt eyes on me. I heard people asking me all kinds of questions. I felt Lundlund's head resting against my shoulder. I noticed my shirt sticking to my chest. I realized she only leaned on me like this when she was tired. I felt every gaze and every sound weighing on me like lead, and I thought each word of conversation seemed ready to explode at any moment.\n[2008-07-29 13:51:00] kitchen | I saw people smiling at Lundlund, touching her cheeks. I heard someone softly ask if she was tired. I realized Lundlund made things easier. I thought having her in my arms was like a kind of protection, because her presence distracted others' attention.\n[2008-07-29 13:51:30] kitchen | I saw Lundlund lift her arms and beam with joy whenever she spotted me. I watched myself pick her up and settle her into my lap. I believed my relationship with Lundlund was largely built on holding her. I noticed she never wanted to walk, and I realized I also enjoyed having her close, this chubby little thing with big eyes and a hungry mouth.\n[2008-07-29 13:52:30] living room | I scooped some beans, chickpea casserole, and couscous onto a plate and carried it into the living room. I saw children gathered around the center of the room, their parents standing behind them, attending to them. Before me stood a low little table in the middle of the room, crowded with children.\n[2008-07-29 13:52:40] living room | I saw myself placing the plate in front of Vanja. I heard Vanja immediately say, 'Don't want to eat anything.'\n[2008-07-29 13:53:00] living room | I saw myself lifting a few beans with a fork and bringing them to Lundlund’s mouth. I noticed Lundlund tightly closed her lips and turned her head away. I said, 'That's fine, if you don't want to eat, you don't have to. Do you think Lundlund might want a little?'\n[2008-07-29 13:53:10] living room | I gently urged, 'Eat something. I know you're hungry.'\n[2008-07-29 13:53:15] living room | I heard Vanja ask me, 'Can we play trains?'\n[2008-07-29 13:53:30] living room | I stared at Vanja. I thought that usually in such situations she would either fixate on the train set or tilt her face up at me, pleading endlessly—but I realized this time she was looking straight ahead.\n[2008-07-29 13:54:30] living room | I saw myself putting Lundlund down and walking to the corner of the room. I found I had to press my knees against my body, almost up to my chest, just to squeeze into a bit of space among the tiny children's furniture and piles of toy boxes. I replied, 'Of course we can.'\n[2008-07-29 13:55:30] living room | I took apart the train set piece by piece and handed the parts to Vanja. I saw that whenever the pieces didn't fit, she forced them together with all her strength. I stood by waiting. I noticed Vanja had grown tired of reassembling it. I could see she was about to throw the pieces in frustration, so I stepped in just in time.\n[2008-07-29 13:56:30] living room | I saw myself looking around for something to distract her. I saw Lundlund toss out the puzzles, stuffed toys, and that plastic horse with long lashes and a pink mane. Before me lay scattered puzzles, plush toys, and various small plastic horses on the floor. I noticed Lundlund kept trying to overturn the tracks.\n[2008-07-29 13:56:40] living room | I heard Vanja shriek, “Dad, will you help me?!”\n[2008-07-29 13:57:00] living room | I looked into Vanja’s eyes. I smiled and said, “Of course I will. Look, we can build a bridge here, then the train can go over it—and under it too. That’ll be fun, won’t it?”\n[2008-07-29 13:57:10] living room | I noticed Lundlund suddenly grab one of the bridge pieces. I heard Vanja shout loudly, “Lundlund!”\n[2008-07-29 13:57:30] living room | I saw myself take the bridge piece back from Lundlund. I saw that Lundlund began screaming. I picked her up and stood up. I heard Lundlund emit a piercing scream.\n[2008-07-29 13:57:35] living room | I heard Vanja say in defeat, “I can’t put it together!”\n[2008-07-29 13:58:00] kitchen | I saw myself carry Lundlund to the kitchen. I said to them, “I’ll be right back. Just give Lundlund to Mom and I’ll return.” I thought to myself how I now felt like an experienced housewife.\n[2008-07-29 13:59:00] kitchen | I saw Nils Nils chatting with Gustav. Before me stood Gustav—short but solidly built, neatly dressed. I saw his thick neck, broad jaw; his face was plump but cheerful and radiant. As far as I know, among all the parents at Mountain Cat, Gustav is the only one with a traditional profession. I wondered why Nils Nils seemed to get along so well with him. I noticed he had a naturally cheerful disposition, glowing with vitality.\n[2008-07-29 13:59:30] kitchen | I heard Gustav speak passionately about a book he’d read: “Absolutely brilliant—have you read it? It’s about a real estate agent, an ordinary man, yes, and his life—so plain, so common. Ford has captured the soul of America! The tone of America! The pulse of America!” I knew he enjoyed talking about books he'd read, and learned he had recently finished something by Richard Ford.\n[2008-07-29 14:00:00] kitchen | I think I like him, especially his decency. I believe that's because he has a simple, honest job—something none of my friends, and certainly not I myself lately, possess. I realize we're the same age, yet he looks ten years older. That kind of maturity he has—it reminds me of how my parents' generation looked when I was a child.\n[2008-07-29 14:00:30] kitchen | I suggested, \"Lundlund should probably go to sleep soon; she seems tired. Maybe hungry too. Can you take her home?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:00:35] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils ask, \"Alright, after eating then? Is that okay?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:00:40] kitchen | I replied firmly, \"Of course.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:01:00] kitchen | I heard David say to me, \"Now I've actually flipped through your book! I was at the bookstore and happened to see it. Looks interesting. It's published by Norstedts, right?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:01:10] kitchen | I saw myself forcing a smile at him. I responded, \"Yes, they published it.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:01:20] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils ask, his voice laced with open teasing, \"So you didn't buy it then?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:01:30] kitchen | I saw him wipe his mouth with a napkin while speaking to me. I heard David reply, \"No, not yet. The one about angels, right?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:01:40] kitchen | I nodded. I felt Lundlund slowly slipping down in my arms, so I adjusted her and held her more securely. I suddenly noticed that Lundlund's diaper had become heavy and full.\n[2008-07-29 14:01:55] kitchen | I said to Nils Nils, \"You two wait until I've changed her diaper before leaving. Did you bring the diaper bag?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:02:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils reply, \"Yes, it's in the hallway.\"",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 14:02:15] hallway | I nodded and said, \"Good.\" Then I turned to see Vanja and Achilles running wildly in the living room, jumping from the sofa to the floor. I noticed they were laughing loudly, getting back up, and jumping again. Seeing the children play, I felt a warm surge rise in my chest.\n[2008-07-29 14:03:00] bathroom | I bent down to grab diapers and wipes. I felt Lundlund clinging to me like a koala. I set her on the floor, pulled off her socks, and saw myself tear the adhesive strip at the top of the diaper and toss it into the wastebasket. I noticed there was no changing table in the bathroom. All I saw was cold tile flooring, and the wastebasket sat beneath the sink.\n[2008-07-29 14:03:30] bathroom | I saw that throughout all this, Lundlund kept staring at me. I noticed Lundlund was watching me with an unusually serious expression.\n[2008-07-29 14:03:35] bathroom | I heard Lundlund say to me, \"Only pee!\"\n[2008-07-29 14:03:45] bathroom | I saw her turn her head away and stare at the wall. I thought she clearly didn't care about being changed into a clean diaper, and I realized she'd had this attitude ever since infancy.\n[2008-07-29 14:04:00] bathroom | I said, \"There, all done.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:05:00] bathroom | I took her hands and helped her stand, then folded her slightly damp leggings and put them into the stroller’s bag, fetched a pair of sweatpants to dress her in, followed by a brown corduroy jacket with a bubbled lining. As far as I knew, Henrik Inge had given her this corduroy jacket for her first birthday.\n[2008-07-29 14:05:30] bathroom | While I was putting shoes on Lundlund, I saw Nils Nils come in.\n[2008-07-29 14:05:40] bathroom | I watched as we kissed each other. I said, \"I'll be leaving soon too.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:06:00] foyer | I saw Nils Nils holding a bag in one hand and lifting up Lundlund with the other, then watched them walk away.\n[2008-07-29 14:06:30] apartment | I saw Vanya sprinting down the hallway, with Achilles right behind her, rushing into a bedroom. I heard Vanya’s overly excited voice coming from inside.\n[2008-07-29 14:08:00] bathroom | I pushed open the bathroom door, locked myself inside, and stood motionless for several minutes. I thought that since the idea of walking back to the kitchen and sitting down at the table held no real appeal, I might as well stay hidden in the bathroom.\n[2008-07-29 14:09:00] bathroom | I washed my face with cold water, carefully dried it with a white towel, and then met my own gaze in the mirror. I thought how gloomy that gaze was, how stiff and hardened by despair the expression—this face made me wary.\n[2008-07-29 14:10:00] kitchen | I returned to the kitchen and noticed no one seemed to register my return; only a small woman with a serious expression briefly fixed her eyes on me through her glasses. I noticed she had short hair and an unadorned, rigid appearance. I wondered in my mind, what does she want?\n[2008-07-29 14:11:00] kitchen | I heard Gustav and Linus discussing plans after retirement. I heard the man in the 1950s-style shirt, looking gloomy, talking with his son about the Kristianvik football team. I heard Frida chatting with Mia about a club-style party she and some friends were planning. I noticed the mischievous child with nearly white-blond hair sitting on his father's lap.\n[2008-07-29 14:11:30] kitchen | I noticed Linus also wanted to join the conversation; I saw him occasionally staring at Gustav, sometimes glancing at him quickly. I heard Erik and Mattias comparing the quality of television screens. I realized Linus didn’t want to appear impolite.\n[2008-07-29 14:12:00] kitchen | I saw that the short-haired woman was the only one not joining the chat. I watched her lean across the table toward me. I heard her ask me if I was satisfied with the kindergarten.\n[2008-07-29 14:12:15] kitchen | I answered, 'I am satisfied.' Then I explained, 'Perhaps there is indeed a bit more to do at the kindergarten, but investing extra time is certainly worthwhile—you get to know the children’s friends, and I think that’s a good thing.'\n[2008-07-29 14:12:30] kitchen | I saw her respond to my words with a faint smile. I thought there must be something troubling her, something that made her sad.\n[2008-07-29 14:13:00] kitchen | I saw Linus suddenly shove his chair back. I heard Linus blurt out, 'What the hell?' Then he shouted, 'What are they doing in there?'\n[2008-07-29 14:13:30] bathroom doorway | I saw him get up and go into the bathroom; a moment later, he came out leading Vanya and Achilles ahead of him.\n[2008-07-29 14:13:45] kitchen | I saw Vanya's face lit up with laughter, while Achilles looked deeply guilty. I noticed both sleeves of Achilles' little suit were soaked through, and I also saw that Vanya's bare arms were glistening from the water.\n[2008-07-29 14:14:00] kitchen | I caught Vanya's eye for a moment, and I couldn't help but laugh. I heard Linus say, 'When I walked in, both of their hands were stuck deep in the toilet—deep as could be.'\n[2008-07-29 14:14:30] hallway | I saw Linus lead Achilles toward the hallway. I heard Linus say, 'We've got to get these clothes off, young man,' then added, 'You really need to wash your hands properly.'\n[2008-07-29 14:14:45] kitchen | I stood up as I spoke. I said, 'Same goes for you, Vanya. I'm coming with you to the bathroom.'\n[2008-07-29 14:15:15] bathroom | I saw Vanya stretch both arms over the sink, tilting her face up toward me. I heard Vanya say, 'I was just teasing Achilles!'\n[2008-07-29 14:15:25] bathroom | I said, 'I can see that. But you didn't have to put your hands in the toilet, did you?'\n[2008-07-29 14:15:30] bathroom | I heard Vanya reply, 'No, I didn't.' Then she burst out laughing in front of me.\n[2008-07-29 14:16:30] bathroom | I wet my hands under the tap, lathered soap, and washed her arms thoroughly from fingertips to shoulders, dried them, kissed her forehead, and then led her out.\n[2008-07-29 14:17:30] kitchen | I saw myself sit down with a forced smile, and I noticed that Linus started telling another story as soon as he returned. I thought the apologetic smile was completely unnecessary—no one cared about what had just happened. I heard Linus talking about seeing monkeys attack a man in Thailand.\n[2008-07-29 14:18:30] kitchen | I saw the others burst into laughter while Linus himself didn't smile at all, and I watched him wave one hand through the air. I heard Linus saying, 'Like this, like this, like this.' I thought he seemed to be feeding off everyone's laughter, using it to keep the story alive.\n[2008-07-29 14:19:00] kitchen | I saw the serious-looking woman, who had been staring out the window, pull her chair closer and lean forward across the table again. I heard her ask, 'Isn’t it difficult having two children so close in age?'\n[2008-07-29 14:19:30] kitchen | I answered, 'Well, yes and no. It’s a bit exhausting. But two is better than one. A single child seems kind of sad, if you ask me… I’ve always thought I’d want three kids. That way they’d have so many combinations when playing games. And when it comes to facing their parents, they’d at least have the advantage in numbers…'\n[2008-07-29 14:19:40] kitchen | I saw her smile, noticing she didn’t say anything. It suddenly occurred to me that she only had one child.\n[2008-07-29 14:19:50] kitchen | I said, 'But having just one is fine too.'\n[2008-07-29 14:20:10] kitchen | I saw her prop her chin up with one hand. I heard her say to me, 'But I wish Gustav had a younger brother or sister. It’s just too hard with only the two of us.'\n[2008-07-29 14:20:25] kitchen | I replied, 'Not at all—he’ll have plenty of friends at kindergarten. That’s good enough.'\n[2008-07-29 14:20:35] kitchen | I heard her say helplessly, 'The problem is I don’t have a husband, so it’s impossible.'\n[2008-07-29 14:20:45] kitchen | I inwardly thought, What the hell does that have to do with me?\n[2008-07-29 14:21:00] kitchen | I looked at her, giving a sympathetic gaze, and tried hard to focus so my eyes wouldn't wander. I realized that in moments like this, it's easy for one's eyes to start wandering.\n[2008-07-29 14:21:15] kitchen | I heard her continue, 'I can't imagine any of the men I've met being a father to my child.'\n[2008-07-29 14:21:25] kitchen | I responded, 'Don't say that. These things naturally work out in time.'\n[2008-07-29 14:21:35] kitchen | I heard her sigh, 'I don't believe they could do it, but thanks anyway.'\n[2008-07-29 14:22:00] kitchen | I caught movement in the corner of my eye. I turned toward the door and saw Vanja approaching; she stopped beside me. I noticed motion near the doorway.\n[2008-07-29 14:22:10] kitchen | I asked Vanja, 'Do you want to go home?'\n[2008-07-29 14:22:25] kitchen | I said to her, 'We need to stay a little longer. The cake will be served soon. You'd like some too, right?'\n[2008-07-29 14:22:30] kitchen | I saw that she didn't answer.\n[2008-07-29 14:22:40] kitchen | I saw Vanja nod, so I moved my wine glass aside and lifted her up. I asked, 'Do you want to sit on my lap?'\n[2008-07-29 14:23:00] kitchen | I said to her, 'You stay with me for a bit, then we'll go back inside. I can stay with you. Is that okay?'\n[2008-07-29 14:23:05] kitchen | I heard Vanya reply simply, \"Okay.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:23:30] kitchen | I felt her sitting on my lap, watching her gaze at the others around the table. I wondered what she was thinking, trying to imagine how she made sense of everything before her.\n[2008-07-29 14:24:00] kitchen | I observed her carefully. I saw that her blue eyes turned in slightly, which was why she wore glasses. Her long golden hair fell past her shoulders; I noticed her small nose and mouth, and that both her tiny ears had elf-like pointed tips. I realized those eyes always revealed her emotions.\n[2008-07-29 14:24:30] kitchen | I recalled how she used to be proud of wearing glasses, but now I noticed the first thing she did when angry was to take them off. I guessed it might be because she knew how important the glasses were to us.\n[2008-07-29 14:25:00] kitchen | I noticed her eyes were lively and joyful when she was with us, unless she flew into a rage and became unreachable. I thought she had an extremely dramatic personality, capable of ruling the household with moods. I observed how she enjoyed staging elaborate plays with her toys, and learned that although she loved listening to stories, watching films delighted her even more.\n[2008-07-29 14:26:00] kitchen | I found she especially favored films with strong characters and intricate plots. I noticed she would ponder them deeply and discuss them repeatedly with us, and realized that retelling the storylines from time to time brought her joy.",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 14:27:00] home | I saw her jump down from the chair, close her eyes, and lie on the floor, supported by me. I watched myself pick her up and carry her to bed. As far as I knew, she had been particularly obsessed with Mårding for a while. I understood the game rule was that we had to first believe she was dead, then discover she had a concussion. I knew it pleased her more if I hummed the movie’s theme song. I remembered how she lay with eyes closed and arms limp, then suddenly sprang up and ran back to the chair to start it all over again.\n[2008-07-29 14:28:00] kindergarten | I saw her bow in response to applause at the Christmas party. I learned she was the only child at the party who did this. I noticed she clearly enjoyed being the center of attention.\n[2008-07-29 14:29:00] kitchen | I discovered that for her, ideas often mattered more than things themselves. I noticed she could talk about candy all day, yet when I saw candy placed before her, she would taste it and spit it out. I realized she didn’t learn from experience, and I thought that next Saturday her excitement about candy would rise just as high again.\n[2008-07-29 14:30:00] ice rink | I watched her step onto the ice in skates and helmet, seeing her tremble with anger. I learned she had really wanted to skate at that moment. I knew the skates were bought for her by her grandmother. I sensed her anger came from realizing she couldn't stand steady, and from knowing she couldn't quickly master balance.\n[2008-07-29 14:31:00] Grandma's garden | I saw that we tested her new skiing gear in Grandma's garden. I learned she was delighted to discover she could ski after all. I realized the idea of skiing meant more than the actual act—I found she could experience great joy without ever really skiing.\n[2008-07-29 14:32:00] Kitchen | I noticed she loved traveling and new places, and I observed that she would talk about these experiences for months afterward. But I realized what she enjoyed most was playing with little kids, and I thought having other children come home with her was a particularly wonderful experience for her.\n[2008-07-29 14:33:00] Home | I saw her walking around the entire evening checking her toys. I saw that as soon as Benjamin arrived, they immediately hit it off. I learned she had just turned three at the time of that gathering. I sensed she had stubbornly worried whether the toys would be satisfactory, but I realized all those earlier concerns were swept away by excitement.\n[2008-07-29 14:34:00] Home | I saw her sitting on the bed playing with Barbie dolls when I delivered the message to her. I relayed Benjamin’s words to her, hearing that he praised her as the cutest girl in kindergarten. I learned Benjamin had expressed his fondness for Vanja to his parents. I noticed she reacted to the news with an attitude I had never seen before.\n[2008-07-29 14:34:10] Home | I asked her in the hallway, 'Do you know what Benjamin said?' As far as I know, that happened on September 20, 2007.\n[2008-07-29 14:34:15] Home | I saw her looking up at me while speaking, as if suddenly intrigued. I heard her reply, 'I don't know.'\n[2008-07-29 14:34:20] Home | I told her, 'He said you're the cutest girl in kindergarten.'\n[2008-07-29 14:34:40] Home | I saw her face flush with happiness. I knew neither Nils Nils nor I could ever say anything that would make her this happy. I remarked that I had never seen such radiance on her face. I immediately realized clearly that she didn’t belong to us—she fully held her own life in her hands.\n[2008-07-29 14:34:50] Home | I heard her ask eagerly, 'What did he say again?' I realized she wanted to hear it once more.\n[2008-07-29 14:34:55] Home | I told her, 'He said you're the cutest in kindergarten.' The words 'at the theater...' still faintly echoed in my ears.\n[2008-07-29 14:35:15] home | I saw her smile—shy but happy. I was glad for her too, yet I felt a shadow clouding my happiness. I wondered if she already cared too much about others’ thoughts and opinions? I asked myself inwardly: wouldn’t it be better if everything came from within her, rooted in herself alone?\n[2008-07-29 14:35:00] kindergarten | I went to pick her up from kindergarten; I saw her running down the hallway toward me. I heard her ask me if Stella could come with her to the riding school later. I replied that it wasn't so simple—it had to be arranged in advance, and we first needed to speak with her parents. I know this happened on April 10, 2008. I marveled that once again she surprised me like this.\n[2008-07-29 14:36:30] kindergarten | I saw her standing there listening after I finished speaking, clearly disappointed. At that moment, I was ducking into the corridor, searching everywhere for her rain gear. I heard her go over and tell Stella the news, but I noticed she didn’t use my reasons.\n[2008-07-29 14:36:40] kindergarten | I heard her say to Stella: 'You’d probably find the horse school kind of boring—just standing around watching. It’s not cool.'\n[2008-07-29 14:37:00] kindergarten | I was out in the rain, walking with her toward People's Park. I reflected inwardly that this way of thinking—prioritizing others’ reactions—I also found in myself. I wondered how she had learned it. Was it already there, surrounding her, invisible yet present, like the air she breathed? Or was it inherited?\n[2008-07-29 14:38:00] kitchen | I thought about how I had never revealed these thoughts about the child to anyone, except Nils Nils, because I felt these complex matters belonged only where they arose—in my heart, between me and Nils Nils. I realized that in reality, in the world where Vanja lived, everything was simple, and complexity only emerged when all these parts were added together—a fact she naturally knew nothing about.\n[2008-07-29 14:39:00] kitchen | I sighed inwardly, feeling that no matter how much we talk about children, it doesn’t help with daily life. I felt everything was in disarray, constantly teetering on the edge of complete chaos.\n[2008-07-29 14:35:00] kindergarten | I heard the staff talk about Vanja’s situation, saying she didn’t communicate with teachers, refused to sit on their laps, and shied away from gentle pats or caresses—she was very shy. I remember it was November 10, 2007, our first so-called 'development talk' with the kindergarten staff.\n[2008-07-29 14:35:30] kindergarten | I heard them suggest that we should try to make her more assertive, teach her to take a more dominant role in play, initiate more, and talk more with others.\n[2008-07-29 14:36:00] kindergarten | I heard Nils Nils argue that Vanja was plenty assertive at home—she always wanted to lead every game, constantly took initiative, and talked nonstop.\n[2008-07-29 14:36:30] kindergarten | I saw them hand us a brochure about local speech therapists. I heard them tell us that Vannia spoke very little at kindergarten, and when she did, it was unclear and incorrect, with an insufficient vocabulary. I heard them ask if we had considered speech therapy for her.\n[2008-07-29 14:37:00] kindergarten | I sighed inwardly—these people are crazy. I thought, speech therapists? Is everything going to be institutionalized now? I realized she’s only three years old!\n[2008-07-29 14:37:15] kindergarten | I responded, 'No, we’re not considering speech therapy. We’ll let things take their course. I didn’t start speaking until I was three. Before that, I couldn’t say anything—only single words, and only my brother could understand me.' I noticed that up until now, Nils Nils had been the one doing all the talking.\n[2008-07-29 14:37:30] kindergarten | I saw them smile. I said to them, 'When I finally started speaking, I spoke fluently right away, pouring out long sentences. Everyone develops differently. We won’t be taking her to a speech therapist.'\n[2008-07-29 14:37:45] kindergarten | I heard the principal, Olaf, say, 'Alright, that’s your decision.' Then he added, 'But you can keep this brochure, just in case you want to reconsider.'\n[2008-07-29 14:37:50] kindergarten | I replied, 'Okay.'",

I recalled how she usually loved it when I did this, especially before falling asleep, until she was completely calm.\n[2008-07-29 14:39:00] kitchen | I noticed she had been looking out the window until now.\n[2008-07-29 14:39:30] kitchen | I saw a white layered cake with raspberries and five small candles standing proudly on the counter. Next to it was a row of square paper boxes containing Bravo sugar-free apple drink.\n[2008-07-29 14:40:00] kitchen | I saw Gustav turn around to look at us. I noticed that Gustav had so far been sitting beside me, half-turned away from me.\n[2008-07-29 14:40:10] kitchen | I heard him ask, \"Hey, Vanya, having fun?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:40:20] kitchen | I saw that Vanya didn't respond or look at him. Then I saw him turn and glance at me.\n[2008-07-29 14:40:35] kitchen | I saw him wink at me. I heard him say to Vanya, \"You must come over to our place sometime and play with Yorck—would you like that?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:40:45] kitchen | I saw Vanya look at him. I noticed her eyes suddenly widen. I heard her reply, \"Yes.\" I knew Yorck was the oldest child at kindergarten. I realized going to Yorck's house was something she had never dared dream of.\n[2008-07-29 14:41:00] kitchen | I saw Gustav raise his wine glass and take a large sip of red wine, then noticed him wipe his mouth with the back of his hand. I heard Gustav say, \"We'll come once we've made arrangements.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:10] kitchen | I heard him ask, \"So, are you writing something new?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:15] kitchen | I watched myself shrug my shoulders. I said, \"Yeah, working on it.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:20] kitchen | I heard him ask, \"Do you work from home?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:25] kitchen | I replied, \"Yes.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:35] kitchen | I heard him ask, \"How do you do it? Just sit there waiting for inspiration to strike?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:45] kitchen | I began to explain, \"No, that won't work. I have to work every day, just like you.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:41:55] kitchen | I heard him murmur, \"Interesting. Interesting. Not many distractions at home, I suppose?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:42:00] kitchen | I replied, \"I can handle it.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:42:05] kitchen | I heard him mutter to himself, \"Of course. Of course...\"\n[2008-07-29 14:42:20] kitchen | I heard Frida suggest, \"Let's all go into the living room and sing a song for Stella together.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:42:35] kitchen | I saw her take a lighter from her pocket and noticed she lit five candles.\n[2008-07-29 14:42:40] kitchen | I heard Mia exclaim, \"What a beautiful cake.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:42:50] kitchen | I heard Frida agree, \"Yes, and healthy too. Hardly any sugar in the cream at all.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:43:00] kitchen | I saw her pick up the cake and noticed everyone was getting up from their seats and gradually leaving the room. I heard her say, \"Erik, could you go in and turn off the lights?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:43:30] living room | I watched myself following behind, holding Vanja's hand, finding a spot against the wall at the far end. I saw Frida walk in carrying the lit cake. The dark living room came into view, with only the flickering candlelight from the cake moving gently.\n[2008-07-29 14:44:00] living room | I saw that as soon as she walked within sight to the table, Frida placed the cake on the table in front of Stella. I noticed Stella was looking at it with bright, shining eyes. I heard her sing 'Happy Birthday to You,' and immediately other adults joined in—the birthday song filled the small room.\n[2008-07-29 14:44:10] living room | I heard Stella ask, 'Do I blow now?'\n[2008-07-29 14:44:15] living room | I saw Frida nodding along while singing.\n[2008-07-29 14:44:30] living room | I saw everyone clap, and I clapped along too. I noticed the lights came back on shortly after. I watched as everyone spent a few more minutes cutting the cake and distributing it to the children. The room was filled with applause, and the light returned from darkness to brightness.\n[2008-07-29 14:45:30] living room | I saw Vanja didn't want to sit at the table, so I watched as we settled down on the floor against the wall. I saw the cake plate placed on her lap. I noticed Vanja was barefoot, with no shoes on her feet.\n[2008-07-29 14:45:40] living room | I asked her, 'Where are your golden shoes?'\n[2008-07-29 14:45:45] living room | I heard her reply, 'Silly shoes.'\n[2008-07-29 14:45:55] living room | I said to her, 'No, not silly—lovely! Those are real princess shoes!'\n[2008-07-29 14:46:00] living room | I heard her say stubbornly again, 'Silly shoes.'\n[2008-07-29 14:46:05] living room | I pressed, 'But where are they?'\n[2008-07-29 14:46:10] living room | I saw her press her lips tightly together, unwilling to respond.\n[2008-07-29 14:46:15] living room | I called out to her: \"Vanya.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:46:25] living room | I saw her nod toward another room. I heard her look up at me and say: \"Over there.\" I saw her looking up at me, noticing that her mouth was full of white frosting.\n[2008-07-29 14:47:30] another room | I watched myself get up and walk in, looked around the room, but found no shoes, so I walked back to the living room.\n[2008-07-29 14:47:45] living room | I heard myself ask: \"Where did you put the shoes? I can't find them anywhere.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:47:50] living room | I heard her reply: \"Next to the flowers.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:48:00] living room | I went back and carefully checked between each flowerpot on the windowsill, but didn't find the shoes there. I wondered to myself: Flowers? Could she mean the yucca?\n[2008-07-29 14:49:00] living room | I grabbed the shoes, brushed the soil back into the flowerpot, then went to the bathroom to wipe off the remaining dirt, and finally placed them under the chair where her coat lay. I found the shoes were indeed inside the flowerpot.\n[2008-07-29 14:50:00] living room | I thought the cake incident had captured all the children's attention—maybe this would give her a chance to start over. I sensed things might get easier soon.\n[2008-07-29 14:50:15] living room | I heard myself say to her: \"I'll have a piece of cake too. I'll be sitting in the kitchen. If you need anything, come find me, okay?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:50:20] living room | I heard her obediently reply, \"Okay, Dad.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:51:00] kitchen | I saw the clock hanging by the kitchen door showing it was almost half past four. I walked up to the counter, sliced off a thin piece of cake for myself, placed it on a plate, and sat down on the opposite side of the table. I noticed someone else had taken my seat. I realized no one had said their goodbyes yet; apparently, nobody was planning to leave. I thought that since no one else was leaving, we should probably wait a while longer before we left too.\n[2008-07-29 14:51:30] kitchen | I heard Erik ask me, \"There's still coffee—would you like some?\" I noticed he was looking at me with a meaningful smile, making me feel as though there was more behind his words than met the eye.\n[2008-07-29 14:52:00] kitchen | I thought that, as far as I knew, this was just one of his tricks to appear important—similar to the way mediocre writers try to imbue their novels with profound depth. I couldn't help wondering—could it be that he actually saw something?\n[2008-07-29 14:52:15] kitchen | I nodded, got up, took a cup from the stack, filled it with coffee from the nearby pot. As I returned to my seat, I saw him walking out the door. I politely responded, \"Yes, thanks.\" The gray Steyrton kettle came into view.\n[2008-07-29 14:53:00] kitchen | I heard Frida talking about the coffee machine she had just bought, saying the price had made her hesitate, but she didn't regret it—she felt the money was well spent, and the coffee was excellent. I realized she believed it was important to indulge oneself now and then for things like this.\n[2008-07-29 14:54:00] kitchen | I heard Linus talk about a comedy sketch he'd seen before, where two guys were sitting drinking coffee, and one pressed down the plunger on a French press, pushing everything down until nothing was left in the pot. I could picture the comical scene clearly.\n[2008-07-29 14:54:15] kitchen | I noticed nobody laughed. I saw Linus shrug his shoulders and raise his hands. I heard Linus awkwardly joke, \"Just a simple coffee anecdote—anyone have a better one?\" I found everyone's reaction rather cold.\n[2008-07-29 14:55:00] hallway | I saw Vanja standing in the hallway. I noticed her gaze slowly sweep across the dining table, and when she saw me, she came over. I was in the kitchen and saw Vanja appear in the doorway.",

I want to too. I'll eat this piece of cake first, then drink this cup of coffee. Now do you want to sit on my lap?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:55:40] kitchen | I saw her nod, so I watched myself lift her up onto my lap.\n[2008-07-29 14:56:00] kitchen | I heard Frida say with a smile, \"I'm glad you could come, Vanya. It'll be fishing time soon. You'd like to join in, right?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:56:15] kitchen | I saw Vanya nod. I watched Frida turn back toward Linus. I heard Frida talking about the club party she was planning to organize.\n[2008-07-29 14:56:30] kitchen | I whispered to Vanya, \"Do you want to join? Should we wait until the fishing contest starts before leaving?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:56:35] kitchen | I saw Vanya clearly shake her head.\n[2008-07-29 14:57:00] kitchen | I used my fork to cut into the cake—I saw the brown crisp base beneath the white cream, the yellow interior, and the red stripes of jam—then twisted my wrist to lay the piece flat on the fork, lifting it over Vanya and into my own mouth. I knew that during the game, each child would get a small fishing rod to cast over a sheet. I thought about how this household would probably pack peas or artichokes into their gift bags.\n[2008-07-29 14:57:15] kitchen | I tasted the cake and found the bottom too dry, and the cream far too low on sugar. But I realized it wasn't too bad when washed down with coffee.\n[2008-07-29 14:57:25] kitchen | I saw Vanya nod, and I watched myself spear a piece with the fork and feed it into her mouth. I saw her tilt her face up and smile. I asked her, \"Would you like a bite?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:57:35] kitchen | I suggested to her, \"I can come with you to the living room, then we can see what everyone else is doing. Maybe we'll even play fishing together.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:57:40] kitchen | I heard Vanja stubbornly repeat, \"You said we were going home.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:57:45] kitchen | I obediently replied, \"I did say that. Let's go.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:58:00] kitchen | I put my fork down on the plate and finished my coffee. I set her down on the floor, stood up, and looked around. I noticed I didn't meet anyone's gaze.\n[2008-07-29 14:58:05] kitchen | I said, \"We're leaving now.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:58:15] kitchen | I saw Erik enter just then. I noticed he was holding a small bamboo rod in one hand and a plastic bag from Hengstenberg supermarket in the other.\n[2008-07-29 14:58:20] kitchen | I heard him say, \"We're going to play fishing now.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:58:40] kitchen | I saw some people stand up and join the game while others stayed seated. I guided Vanja toward the door, keeping one hand on her shoulder. I realized no one had noticed that I'd already said goodbye. Since everyone at the table had turned their attention elsewhere, I decided it wasn't necessary to say it again.\n[2008-07-29 14:59:00] hallway | I saw all the children rush past us, hurrying toward the end of the hallway. I saw Erik following behind them like a shepherd, telling them to sit down. I stood in the hallway helping Vanja into her coat and could see them clearly. I heard Erik shout from the living room, \"Time for fishing!\" At the end of the hallway, a white sheet hung between two walls, serving as a barrier.\n[2008-07-29 14:59:30] hallway | I zipped up her red puffer jacket, then took the red wool hat from Boland & Prytz, placed it on her head, and fastened the chin strap. I put her boots in front of her so she could step into them herself. Once she was ready, I zipped up the boots from behind. I noticed the jacket was getting a bit small.\n[2008-07-29 14:59:40] hallway | I said to her, \"Alright, now all you have to do is say thank you, and then we can leave. Come on.\"\n[2008-07-29 14:59:45] hallway | I watched her raise her arms toward me.\n[2008-07-29 14:59:50] hallway | I asked, \"Can you walk by yourself?\"\n[2008-07-29 14:59:55] hallway | I saw her shake her head, her arms still raised in the air.\n[2008-07-29 15:00:00] hallway | I told her, \"Okay, but I need to get dressed first.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:15:30] hallway | I saw Benjamin was the first one 'fishing' in the hallway. I watched him cast his fishing line. I noticed someone—probably Erik—grabbing it from the other side of the white sheet.\n[2008-07-29 15:30:35] hallway | I heard Benjamin shout, \"Fish on!\"\n[2008-07-29 15:31:00] hallway | I watched Benjamin yank hard on the fishing rod. I saw a red-and-white Hengstorp bag, clipped shut, fly over the sheet.\n[2008-07-29 15:31:30] hallway | I saw him take down the bag, step away a few paces, and open it. I noticed the next child was Theresa, who took hold of the fishing rod with her mother's help. I noticed Benjamin seemed both calm and quiet.\n[2008-07-29 15:32:00] hallway | I wrapped my scarf around my neck, fastened my double-breasted short coat, put on my hat, and bent down to find my shoes from the pile by the wall. A pair of black Weejuns with yellow laces came into view. I knew this coat and hat were bought during last spring's sale at Paul Smith's store in Harvik.\n[2008-07-29 15:32:30] hallway | I heard the host ask me a question with enthusiasm and insight, yet I couldn't answer cleverly. As far as I know, I bought these shoes when I went to Otanberg for the book fair. I recalled that I had never liked these shoes, not even when I bought them. I thought of the disastrous experience at the book fair, a memory that made the shoes seem even worse to me.\n[2008-07-29 15:32:45] hallway | I suppose the only reason I hadn't thrown these shoes away earlier was because we were short on money. Looking at the yellow laces, I sighed inwardly.\n[2008-07-29 15:33:00] hallway | I tied my shoelaces and stood up.\n[2008-07-29 15:33:30] hallway | I picked her up and carried her through the hallway, then poked my head into the kitchen. I saw four or five parents still chatting. I said to myself, \"I'm ready.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:33:45] kitchen | I said to the people in the kitchen, \"We're off then. Take care, it's been a lovely evening—thank you.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:33:55] kitchen | I saw Gustav half-raising one hand toward me in greeting. I heard Linus say, \"Thank you too.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:34:15] hallway | I entered the hallway. I reached out and tapped Frida on the shoulder to get her attention. I saw she was standing against the wall, smiling and completely absorbed in the game on the floor.\n[2008-07-29 15:34:30] hallway | I said to Frida, \"We're leaving now. Thank you so much for inviting us. Such a lovely party—really wonderful.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:34:35] hallway | I heard her ask, \"But won't Vanya go fishing anymore?\"\n[2008-07-29 15:34:45] hallway | I made a grimace. I think the unspoken message behind my expression was supposed to be, 'You know how unpredictable children can be.'\n[2008-07-29 15:34:55] hallway | I heard her say, \"Fine, fine, alright then. Thanks for coming. Take care on your way home, Vanya!\"\n[2008-07-29 15:35:10] hallway | I saw Mia hugging Theresa while standing to the side. I heard Mia say, \"Wait a second.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:35:30] hallway | I saw her bend down and crawl under the sheet. I heard Erik say from the other side of the sheet that he could give out a gift bag.\n[2008-07-29 15:35:40] hallway | I saw Mia hand the gift bag to Vanya. I heard Mia say, \"Here you go, Vanya. You can take this home. If you'd like, you can share some with Lundlund.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:35:45] hallway | I saw Vanya clutch the bag tightly against her chest. I heard Vanya insist stubbornly, \"I don't want to.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:35:55] hallway | I called out loudly, \"Thank you so much!\" Then I said goodbye to everyone, \"Bye now, everyone!\"\n[2008-07-29 15:36:05] hallway | I saw Stella turn her head and notice us. I heard Stella ask, \"You're leaving, Vanya? Why?\"\n[2008-07-29 15:36:15] hallway | I said, \"Goodbye, Stella, thank you for inviting us to your party.\"",

I heard the constant sounds of voices, shouts, footsteps, and motors from the street around me. I realized she wasn't usually like this—I remembered that it was Lundlund who liked to act this way.\n[2008-07-29 15:38:00] street | I saw a taxi with its roof light on speeding past. I noticed a man and a woman pushing a baby stroller walking by us. The young woman with a headscarf came into view; I estimated she might only be about twenty years old.\n[2008-07-29 15:38:20] street | I watched them walk away. I noticed the woman had thick makeup on her face. I saw the older man, who looked about my age, constantly glancing around nervously. I realized I had only gotten a rough impression of the woman’s appearance at the time.\n[2008-07-29 15:38:35] street | I saw that ridiculous stroller, with a thin, stem-like rod extending from the wheel area, supporting the child's seat on top.\n[2008-07-29 15:39:00] street | I saw a group of fifteen- or sixteen-year-olds coming from across the street. A group of black-haired youths with slicked-back hair came into view, wearing black leather jackets and black trousers. I noticed that at least two of them wore Puma sneakers with logos on the toe caps. I inwardly thought how stupid I always found shoes of that style.\n[2008-07-29 15:39:15] street | I kept watching the group. I saw gold chains gently swaying around their necks, and I noticed their arms swinging in an awkward way.\n[2008-07-29 15:39:30] street | I suddenly stopped walking. It hit me suddenly in my mind: the shoes! Damn it, I realized the shoes were still at someone else’s house.\n[2008-07-29 15:39:40] street | I hesitated: was it okay to leave them there? I immediately rejected the idea, thinking it made no sense. I told myself we were right at the door anyway.\n[2008-07-29 15:39:50] street | I said, \"We have to go back—you forgot your golden shoes.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:40:00] street | I saw Vanja straighten her body. I heard her say somewhat resistively, \"I don’t want them anymore.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:40:15] street | I reassured her, \"I know, but we can’t just leave the shoes there. We’ll take them home, but you don’t have to keep them.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:41:30] apartment | I rushed up the stairs again, put down Vanja, opened the door and walked into the apartment, going straight for those shoes without looking around. I realized I couldn't avoid Benjamin's gaze even as I straightened up. I realized I still couldn't escape Benjamin's gaze when I stood up.\n[2008-07-29 15:41:45] apartment | I saw him holding a little toy car in one hand and waving at me with the other. I heard Benjamin, sitting on the floor, say to me: \"Hi do!\" Before my eyes was Benjamin in his white shirt, sitting on the floor.\n[2008-07-29 15:42:30] stairwell | I smiled slightly, stepped out of the apartment and closed the door behind me, then picked up Vanja and walked down the stairs. I replied to Benjamin: \"Hi do, Benjamin.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:43:00] street | I looked around me. I felt the cold crispness of the outdoor air. I saw all the city lights—streetlamps, shop windows, car headlights—rising gradually, spreading like a shimmering dome above the rooftops. I noticed the stars had vanished, leaving only a nearly full moon hanging above the Hilton Hotel.\n[2008-07-29 15:43:30] street | I hurried along the street carrying Vanja. I could feel Vanja clinging tightly to me. Before my eyes was the sight of our breath forming white mist swirling around our heads.\n[2008-07-29 15:43:40] street | I heard Vanja ask: \"Maybe Lundlund wants my shoes?\"\n[2008-07-29 15:43:50] street | I answered her: \"She can have them when she's as big as you.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:43:55] street | I heard her say: \"Lundlund likes shoes.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:44:00] street | I nodded and said: \"Yes, she does.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:45:00] subway station | Vanja and I continued in silence for a while. When we reached the subway station, I saw the white-haired crazy old woman staring at me through the window of the café next to the supermarket. Before my eyes was the large sandwich café by the roadside.\n[2008-07-29 15:45:30] subway station | I often hear her talking to herself. What caught my eye was her tightly tied white bun and that beige coat she wears no matter the season. As far as I know, she frequently appears around our neighborhood. I’ve learned she’s aggressive and unpredictable.\n[2008-07-29 15:45:45] subway station | I heard Vanya tilt her head up and ask me, 'Dad, can I have a party for my birthday?'\n[2008-07-29 15:45:50] subway station | I promised, 'If you want one, you’ll have one.'\n[2008-07-29 15:46:00] subway station | I heard her say seriously, 'I do want one. I want Lundlund, and you, and Mom to come.'\n[2008-07-29 15:46:15] subway station | I shifted Vanya from my right arm to my left. I said, 'Sounds like a pretty nice little party.'\n[2008-07-29 15:46:25] subway station | I heard Vanya ask, 'Do you know what I want?' I answered, 'No.'\n[2008-07-29 15:46:35] subway station | I heard Vanya say to me, 'A goldfish—would that be okay?'\n[2008-07-29 15:47:00] subway station | I replied, 'Hmm… To keep a goldfish, you’d have to take good care of it—feeding it, changing the water, things like that. I think you’d need to be a bit older than four.'\n[2008-07-29 15:47:15] subway station | I heard Vanya protest, 'But I can feed it! Ilo has one, and he’s even younger than me.'\n[2008-07-29 15:47:30] subway station | I said, 'Well, we’ll see. Birthday presents should be a secret, you know—otherwise they wouldn’t mean as much.'\n[2008-07-29 15:47:45] subway station | I nodded at Vanya. I heard Vanya ask, \"Confidential? You mean keeping a secret?\"\n[2008-07-29 15:48:15] street | I realized we had startled her; I watched her turn around and look at me. I heard the crazy woman scream, \"Ah, damn it! Damn it!\" I saw the crazy woman just a few meters ahead of us. I saw her eyes blazing with fury, and thought inwardly: Oh no.\n[2008-07-29 15:48:30] street | I heard her shout loudly behind us, \"What shoes are those you've got? Hey, Dad! What shoes are those? Now I've got something to say to you!\"\n[2008-07-29 15:48:40] street | I heard her even louder voice in my ears: \"Damn it! Ah, damn it!\"\n[2008-07-29 15:49:00] street | As I spoke, I held Vanya tighter. I heard Vanya ask, \"What did the old lady say?\" I replied, \"Nothing.\" I said tenderly to her, \"You're my best treasure. The very best.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:49:05] street | I heard Vanya press on, \"Better than Lundlund?\"\n[2008-07-29 15:49:15] street | I smiled at Vanya. I said to her, \"You're both the best—just as good as Lundlund.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:49:30] street | I heard Vanya say quietly, \"Lundlund is better than me.\" I noticed her tone was completely neutral; I thought she seemed to be stating an undisputed fact.\n[2008-07-29 15:49:40] street | I saw Vanya smile after hearing what I said. I said, \"Don't talk nonsense, you little fool.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:50:15] street | I let my gaze pass over Vanya and looked toward the vast, nearly empty supermarket. I saw light glinting off merchandise in the narrow aisles between shelves and counters. Two women sitting behind the cash registers stared straight ahead, waiting for customers.\n[2008-07-29 15:50:45] street | I turned my head and realized the sound came from a large, jeep-like vehicle. I noticed that under the traffic light across the street, a car's engine was revving up. I realized that vehicles like this have started flooding our streets in recent years.\n[2008-07-29 15:51:00] street | To resist this wave of emotion, I began to break into a light jog. I felt such intense tenderness toward Vanja that I realized it was almost tearing me apart.\n[2008-07-29 15:51:30] street | I passed by the Ankara restaurant. I saw it was a Turkish restaurant offering belly dancing and karaoke, but I noticed it was empty inside at the moment. I knew that in the evenings, well-dressed Eastern European men often stood outside its door, and I was familiar with the scent of their aftershave and cigars.\n[2008-07-29 15:52:00] street | I passed by Burger King. I saw an extremely overweight girl wearing a hat and fingerless gloves. She sat alone on a bench outside, devouring a burger.\n[2008-07-29 15:52:30] street | I crossed the intersection, passing the liquor store 'Systembolaget' and the commercial bank. When the red light came on, I stopped walking. I noticed that despite the traffic signal being lit, there were no cars on any of the lanes.\n[2008-07-29 15:52:45] street | From start to finish, I kept Vanja tightly held against my chest.\n[2008-07-29 15:53:15] street | While stopping to wait for the green light, I pointed up at the sky and asked Vanja. I asked, \"Can you see the moon?\" I heard her reply, \"Mm.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:53:40] street | Then, after a moment, I heard her ask, \"Has anyone been up there?\"\nI realized she certainly knew someone had been there. I thought to myself, she also knows how much I enjoy telling these old stories.\n[2008-07-29 15:54:15] street | I began telling her, \"Yes, someone has been there. Shortly after I was born, three people flew up. It was a long journey—seven days. Then they just flew around it and around it.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:54:30] street | I heard Vanya correct, \"They don't fly; they take spaceships.\" I replied, \"You're right, they went in rockets.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:55:10] square | I saw the green light come on, so we walked across the street. I saw that there was a square down ahead. I knew our home was right here.\n[2008-07-29 15:55:30] square | I saw a tall, lanky man in a leather jacket standing at the ATM. I noticed he reached out one hand to retrieve his card and used the other to push the hair from his face. I saw that the man had long hair past his shoulders.\n[2008-07-29 15:55:45] square | I realized it was a feminine gesture, and thought how interesting that was. I also noticed that apart from this, his entire heavy-metal look was styled in a dark, tough, thoroughly masculine way.\n[2008-07-29 15:55:55] square | I felt a gust of wind lift a small pile of bank receipts from the ground by his feet.",

I heard Vanya ask, \"What's that?\" I answered, \"Cold drinks—you know them.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:56:50] apartment entrance | I looked at her. I heard her cry out, \"I want it!\" I told her, \"No, you can't have it. But are you hungry?\" I heard her reply, \"Yes.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:57:05] apartment entrance | I said to her, \"If you'd like, we can get some chicken skewers. Do you want some?\" I heard her say, \"Yes.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:57:30] Thai restaurant | After saying that, I put her down on the ground and opened the door to the restaurant. I said, \"Alright then.\"\n[2008-07-29 15:57:45] Thai restaurant | All I saw was a hole in the wall, and I smelled the scent of noodles and fried chicken. I knew these smells would rise seven floors every day, drifting into our balcony at home.\n[2008-07-29 15:58:30] Thai restaurant | I ordered food from the young Asian girl. I watched the thin, expressionless girl working hard. I noticed her mouth was always slightly open, gum clearly visible on her teeth, and her eyes never showed any emotion, as if nothing could ever stir them. I knew they sold two-dish meals for forty-five kroner per box. As far as I knew, this wasn’t the first time I’d stood before this counter.\n[2008-07-29 15:59:15] Thai restaurant | I saw two young men of similar age in the kitchen, and a man in his fifties rushing between them. I noticed he, too, had no expression, though slightly more friendly. I knew I’d only exchanged brief glances with those boys. As far as I knew, that man had at least been kind when we met in the long basement corridor—when he went to fetch or store things, and I was doing laundry, taking out trash, or pushing my bicycle.\n[2008-07-29 15:59:45] Thai restaurant | I handed the meal box, which appeared on the counter just twenty seconds after ordering, to Vanja. I asked Vanja, 'Can you carry it for a moment?'\n[2008-07-29 16:00:30] Apartment foyer | Vanja nodded, and I paid. We walked together through the next door into the foyer; I saw Vanja put the meal box on the floor and press the elevator button.\n[2008-07-29 16:01:30] Elevator/Outside home | On the way up, I saw Vanja handing me the meal box. I opened the door, and before even stepping inside, I heard her shouting. I heard her loudly calling out the floor numbers in the elevator; as I entered, I heard her yell 'Mama' beside my ear.\n[2008-07-29 16:01:45] Home | I held onto Vanja, and then I saw Nils Nils coming out from the living room. I said to Vanja, 'Take off your shoes first.' I heard the television was on.\n[2008-07-29 16:02:00] Home | I smelled the faint stench of decay from a large garbage bag and two small diaper bundles in the corner, along with an even worse odor. I saw Lundlund’s shoes and coat lying on the floor beside the folded double stroller.\n[2008-07-29 16:02:10] Home | I cursed silently in my mind: Damn it, why didn’t she put the things into the closet?\n[2008-07-29 16:02:25] Home | Before me lay clothes, toys, old flyers, pinwheels, bags, and water bottles scattered all over the hallway. I thought to myself: What has she been doing all afternoon?\n[2008-07-29 16:02:35] home | I thought, but she could just lie on the sofa watching TV.\n[2008-07-29 16:02:45] home | I heard Vanja say, \"I got a big gift pack even though I didn't go fishing!\"\n[2008-07-29 16:03:00] home | I bent down to take off her shoes, feeling her wriggling impatiently. I thought, this is what matters most to her.\n[2008-07-29 16:03:05] home | I heard her exclaim, \"I also played with Achilles!\"\n[2008-07-29 16:03:15] home | I saw Nils Nils squat down in front of Vanja. I heard Nils Nils say, \"Great, let me see what's in the gift pack.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:03:25] home | I saw Vanja open the gift pack to show me.\n[2008-07-29 16:03:45] home | Before my eyes were colorful chocolate nuts, rock candy, and some candy balls resembling raisins. I knew these were organic snacks. As far as I knew, they must have been bought from the new store across our building. I thought, just as expected.\n[2008-07-29 16:04:00] home | I heard her ask, \"Can I eat now?\" I replied, \"Eat the chicken first, go eat in the kitchen.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:04:30] kitchen | I hung her coat on the hook and put her shoes in the closet. I walked into the kitchen, set out the chicken, placed the spring rolls and noodles on a plate. I took out a knife and fork, poured a glass of water, and put everything on the table in front of her.\n[2008-07-29 16:04:45] kitchen | I saw pens, watercolor paint boxes, cups of water, brushes, and papers still scattered across the table.\n[2008-07-29 16:05:00] kitchen | I saw Nils Nils sit down beside Waneya. I heard Nils Nils ask, \"Is everything okay over there?\"\n[2008-07-29 16:05:10] kitchen | I nodded, folding my arms and leaning against the counter.\n[2008-07-29 16:05:20] kitchen | I asked, \"Does Lundlund go to sleep early?\"\n[2008-07-29 16:05:35] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils reply, \"Not really. She has a fever. No wonder she's so listless.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:05:40] kitchen | I asked, \"Fever again?\"\n[2008-07-29 16:05:45] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils answer, \"Yeah, but it's not high.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:06:15] kitchen | I sighed heavily and turned to look at the piles of dirty dishes stacked beside and inside the sink. I said, \"It's a pigsty.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:06:35] kitchen | I heard Waneya say, \"I want to watch a movie.\" I firmly refused, saying, \"Not now. It's way past bedtime.\" Then I heard Waneya insist, \"I want to!\"\n[2008-07-29 16:07:15] kitchen | I turned and looked at Nils Nils; our eyes met. I asked, \"What were you watching on TV?\" I heard Nils Nils retort, \"What do you mean?\" I continued, \"No particular reason. You were watching TV when we came back. I'm just curious what it was.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:07:45] kitchen | I saw it was her turn to sigh. I noticed Waneya raising the chicken fork as if to throw it, so I quickly grabbed her arm. I heard Waneya shout, \"I don't want to sleep!\" I ordered her, \"Put it down.\"\n[2008-07-29 16:08:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils give in and say, 'You can watch for ten minutes and have a small bowl of candy.' I immediately shot back, 'I said she can't.'\n[2008-07-29 16:08:15] kitchen | I watched her as she spoke and then stood up. I heard her insist, 'Just ten minutes, then I'll take her to bed.'\n[2008-07-29 16:08:25] kitchen | I said, 'Oh really? Then I suppose I get to do the dishes, right?'\n[2008-07-29 16:09:00] kitchen | I heard Nils Nils snap, 'What are you talking about? Do whatever you want. If you must know, I've been with Lundlund all this time—she's sick, feeling awful, and impossible to calm down.' I cut in and said, 'I'm going out for a smoke.'\n[2008-07-29 16:10:00] balcony | I put on my coat and shoes and walked straight out to the east-facing balcony. I think I often come here to smoke because there's a roof overhead, and from here I can hardly see anyone at all.\n[2008-07-29 16:10:30] balcony | I stepped onto the small balcony and closed the door behind me. I settled into a chair in the corner, lit my cigarette, propped my feet up on the railing, and gazed down at the backyard below and the rooftops in the distance. Before me stretched the rugged silhouettes of distant rooftops, set against the grand expanse of the sky.\n[2008-07-29 16:11:30] balcony | I watched the landscape shift constantly: one moment, vast clouds gathered into mountains, cliffs, and canyons, mysteriously hovering in the heart of the blue sky; the next, I noticed a cold, damp front advancing from far away, spreading across the horizon like a huge gray-black down comforter. If it were summer, I could sense that hours later lightning would tear through the darkness, and thunder would rumble over the rooftops above me.\n[2008-07-29 16:12:00] balcony | Before me lay the sky in its barest form. I felt that even when smooth, gray, and rainy, it still appeared dazzlingly bright against the dark backdrop of the backyard below. I realized I have a preference for the sky's unadorned face.\n[2008-07-29 16:12:15] balcony | I looked at the rust-green of the roofs, the orange-red of the bricks, and the bronze-yellow of the crane—against this wash of gray and white, I found these colors strikingly vivid. I silently marveled, look how brilliant those colors are!\n[2008-07-29 16:12:45] balcony | I gazed at the ordinary summer's clear blue sky. As the sun neared its end, I saw only a few thin, shapeless clouds drifting by, then noticed scattered twinkling lights—I thought they were vast buildings spreading far into the distance.\n[2008-07-29 16:13:15] balcony | I watched the night fall. The horizon first glowed red, as if the earth had caught fire; then I felt a bright and gentle darkness enveloping the city. I thought that under the kind hand of darkness, the city could rest tonight. I sighed, feeling it had ended its cheerful day in the sun, weary and spent.\n[2008-07-29 16:13:30] balcony | I saw starlight illuminating the night sky, artificial satellites hanging high. I watched planes flicker with lights, flying in and out between two airports.\n[2008-07-29 16:14:30] balcony | I leaned forward, looking down at the courtyard across from me. Between buildings and porticos, I saw faceless figures occasionally appear in windows or on spiral staircases. I noticed a man wearing only shorts take something from the refrigerator and sit down at a table; I heard a door slam shut somewhere, saw a woman in a coat hurry downstairs; I watched a man on the far side ironing clothes—his slow movements suggested he was elderly—and finally saw him turn off the light, plunging the room into darkness. I thought that if what I sought was people, this was exactly what I saw.\n[2008-07-29 16:15:00] balcony | I looked up. I saw that man sometimes waving his arms, jumping up and down, staring at some invisible object before him—I believed without doubt it was a baby. I saw that woman in her fifties often stand by the window gazing outside. I asked myself inwardly: where should I look now?\n[2008-07-29 16:15:30] balcony | I let my gaze move outward, upward. I told myself these lives would not remain within my sight. I had no interest in what I saw or in beauty—I only wanted to rest in this absolute solitude.\n[2008-07-29 16:16:00] balcony | I picked up the half-full bottle of cola from the ground and took a cup from the table, pouring it full. I found the cap was missing—the two-liter bottle of Diet Coke had gone flat.\n[2008-07-29 16:16:30] balcony | I tasted the liquid in the cup. I felt the sweetness of the artificial sweetener becoming more pronounced as the carbonation dissipated. I realized the slightly stimulating sensation was gone, but I didn't care about the taste.\n[2008-07-29 16:16:30] balcony | I placed the cup on the table and took out a cigarette. I recalled the people I had encountered over the past few hours, realizing they had left no impression on me. I thought I wouldn’t care even if they were all burned to death—I realized this was a law in my life.\n[2008-07-29 16:18:00] balcony | I remembered that when I was with others, I felt inseparably bound to them. I experienced a strong resonance and an infinite closeness. I realized this feeling was so intense that their happiness always seemed more important than mine.\n[2008-07-29 16:18:30] balcony | I realized I often made myself inferior, sinking into self-contempt. I became aware of some uncontrollable internal mechanism that compelled me to place their opinions above my own.\n[2008-07-29 16:19:30] balcony | I realized that when I am alone, others mean nothing to me. I suppose it's not because I dislike them—on the contrary, I can often find qualities in most people that I identify with, or some fleeting charm that moves me.\n[2008-07-29 16:20:00] balcony | I realized that liking them doesn't mean caring about them. I found that what traps me is the social environment, not the people themselves. I reflected that these two ideas cannot be reconciled—they are mutually exclusive, and I must choose one or the other.\n[2008-07-29 16:20:30] balcony | I realized my daily life exists somewhere between the two, and perhaps this is why I live so painfully. I feel that obligations and routines are things I must endure rather than enjoy, and I certainly don't find them meaningful or capable of bringing me joy.\n[2008-07-29 16:21:30] balcony | I realized this has nothing to do with unwillingness to do housework, but touches the very essence of life. I feel that the life I'm living is meaningless, and I constantly long to escape from it. I realize life does not belong to me; despite all my efforts, my yearning for something else destroys everything I strive for.\n[2008-07-29 16:21:45] balcony | I asked myself inwardly: where exactly lies the root of the problem?\n[2008-07-29 16:22:30] balcony | I wondered whether it was that harsh, dull noise—I felt it came from the insincere people, places, events, and conflicts we experience in life. I realized these are things we see but do not participate in, and modern life presents us with a distance from our own existence in just this way—one we now find impossible to escape.\n[2008-07-29 16:23:00] balcony | I thought: if the world offered more truth and deeper engagement, as I desire, should I then embrace everything around me? I reflected: if so, should I still long to escape?\n[2008-07-29 16:23:45] balcony | Or, I suspected that the root of the problem in this world I’m supposed to respond to lies in those pre-set patterns of behavior and routine tracks. I felt they make everything predictable, forcing us to consume entertainment just to experience even a trace of tension.\n[2008-07-29 16:24:30] balcony | I saw myself on a micro level—going to the supermarket, sitting down at a café with a newspaper, or picking up a child from kindergarten. I also saw on a macro level how life stretches from first entering kindergarten to finally exiting into a nursing home. I realized that every time I go out, I already know what will happen and what I need to do.\n[2008-07-29 16:25:15] balcony | I saw everywhere the same roads, the same houses, the same gas stations, and the same stores. Or, I realized that the dramatic changes I perceive are merely based on that uniformity which flattens the world and shrinks everything down.\n[2008-07-29 16:26:00] balcony | To my knowledge, as late as the 1960s, you could still see those strange black wooden houses when driving through the Gudbrandsdalen valley—signs of a vanishing local culture. I saw those intensely pure and somber wooden houses, now encapsulated into little museums within a culture indistinguishable from the places I have left or am about to go to.\n[2008-07-29 16:26:30] balcony | I feel that Europe is increasingly merging into one large, homogenized nation. I see that everything looks the same, that all things are the same.\n[2008-07-29 16:27:15] balcony | Or, I wonder, could the problem be the light that illuminates the world, makes everything comprehensible, yet simultaneously drains it of meaning? I suspect the root lies in the vanished forests, extinct species, and ways of life that will never return.\n[2008-07-29 16:28:00] balcony | To my knowledge, the world of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was filled with vast forests, sailing ships and carriages, windmills, castles, monasteries, and general stores, gathering painters, thinkers, and explorers. Yes, I thought of all this, and I thought of it with sorrow and helplessness.",

    "text": "[2008-07-29 16:29:00] balcony | To my knowledge, everything back then was made by hand, wind, or water power; Africa had not yet been conquered, and Native Americans still lived in peace. I learned that darkness fell at sunset and light returned at sunrise, that populations were small and tools too primitive to cause extinction-level impacts on animals. How would it be, I longed to know, to live in such a world?\n[2008-07-29 16:30:00] balcony | To my knowledge, travel from one place to another was exhausting; journeys to distant lands like China took months and were full of danger. I learned that only the wealthy enjoyed comfort, while whales thrived in the oceans and bears and wolves roamed the forests. I imagined what it would be like if life held real possibilities.\n[2008-07-29 16:31:00] balcony | To my knowledge, though that world was harsh, filthy, and rife with disease and suffering, it also gave rise to Shakespeare, Rembrandt, and Newton—figures whose achievements in their respective fields remain unmatched to this day. I reflected: how was such abundant achievement possible during that time? I wondered whether it was because death was closer, making life itself stronger.\n[2008-07-29 16:31:30] balcony | I saw that when I look back, I do not see life but death. I asked myself, who knows? Even so, I realized we cannot turn back time; everything we have done is irreversible.\n[2008-07-29 16:32:30] balcony | I think anyone who believes the spirit of the age is responsible for our maladjustment is either delusional or foolish; I realize such thinking reveals a lack of self-awareness. I feel that my aversion to my own time is not fixed or inevitable.\n[2009-09-01 10:00:00] Kristianvik room | I realize I naturally have no memory of this period at all. Looking at these baby photos taken by my parents, I feel it's utterly impossible to confirm that this was really me. I even think using the word 'I' here is almost absurd.\n[2009-09-01 10:00:10] Kristianvik room\n[2009-09-01 10:00:20] Kristianvik room | I looked at the photo and asked myself: Could this tiny little being really be the same person now sitting in Kristianvik writing these words?\n[2009-09-01 10:00:30] Kristianvik room | I heard the hum of passing vehicles outside the window. I felt the autumn wind rushing in through the old ventilation ducts. Before me lay a cloudy September day. I wondered whether this small creature would one day become a forty-year-old man, sitting in a room writing.\n[2009-09-01 10:00:40] Kristianvik room | I asked myself: Is this infant the same person as that future gray-bearded old man trembling and drooling in a nursing home?\n[2009-09-01 10:00:50] Kristianvik room | I even thought about—let alone—the stiff body that one day would lie on a slab in the morgue.\n[2009-09-01 10:01:00] Kristianvik room | I realized people would still call it 'Grete Lundnes' then.\n[2009-09-01 10:01:10] Kristianvik room | Actually, I pondered, isn't it utterly incredible? Using just one name to encompass the fetus, the infant, the forty-year-old me, the old man, and the corpse. I thought to myself, wouldn't it be more natural to use different names for the different stages, since the sense of self at each stage is so vastly different?\n[2009-09-01 10:01:20] Kristianvik room | I imagined using first names to represent different age periods, middle names to signify continuity of the same person, and the last name belonging to the family.\n[2009-09-01 10:01:30] Kristianvik room | As far as I know, I have no memory of the first six years of my life. Everything I know about that period comes from what my parents told me or from photographs I’ve seen. I recall Dad once pointing out to me the house we used to live in. I realized I truly have no personal recollection of that time.\n[2009-09-01 10:02:00] Kristianvik room | I suppose people think these photos represent memories and nostalgia, but I realize there’s usually no memory actually coming from 'me' within them. I wondered what meaning they really hold.\n[2009-09-01 10:02:10] Kristianvik room | I saw many nearly identical photos among friends and family: the same colors, clothing, and rooms. I saw pictures of people from previous generations—just a group of individuals dressed in unfamiliar clothes. I felt these photographs had no connection to me whatsoever—they were meaningless in a certain sense. I realized they had become incomprehensible and elusive.\n[2009-09-01 10:02:20] Kristianvik room | I saw a photo from the apartment on Thereses Street: a woman in a light blue dress with a 1960s hairstyle standing by an electric stove, her hand resting beside a red-lidded coffee pot. As far as I know, that was my mother in the 1960s. I saw a gentle, almost imperceptible smile on her face. I realized we take photographs for the era, not for the individual. Looking at the image of my mother, I asked myself: Who is she? What is she thinking? How does she view her own life? I found that this photograph actually explains nothing.\n[2009-09-01 10:02:30] Kristianvik room | I looked at the photograph. To me, it was simply a strange woman in a strange room—nothing more.\n[2009-09-01 10:02:40] Kristianvik room\n[2009-09-01 10:02:50] Kristianvik room | I looked at the man in the photograph, ten years later, sitting on a mountainside drinking coffee from the same red-lidded pot because he had forgotten to bring a cup when he set out. I asked myself: Who is he? I noticed his neatly trimmed black beard, thick dark hair, sensitive lips, and cheerful eyes. Ah, yes—I realized it was my father, my dad. But I also wondered, who was he to himself? And just as in all those similar moments, I felt that in that instant, he was nobody at all.\n[2009-09-01 10:03:00] Kristianvik room | I thought that this must be true of all photographs—including my own—that they are utterly hollow. I realized the only meaning one can extract is what they reflect or express about the period. Yet still, I felt these photos were part of my self, the most intimate and personal part, just as others’ photos are meaningful to them. I marveled at how meaning and meaninglessness form the waves running through our lives—the very stimuli and excitement that constitute the fundamental tone of existence.\n[2009-09-01 10:03:10] Kristianvik room | I gathered together everything I remembered from the first six years of my life, along with everything stored in photographs and objects from that time. I realized they were the most essential part of my personal identity. I wanted to fill this 'I' with their meaning and continue forward—otherwise, I would be empty and meaningless. On the basis of these fragmented, incomplete memories, I constructed a Grete Lundnes, a Henrik Inge, a mom and a dad, a house in Høvik, a house in Tjebben, a grandfather and a grandmother, a maternal grandfather and grandmother, a neighbor, and a crowd of children.\n[2009-09-01 10:03:20] Kristianvik room | I looked at this humble temporary dwelling and called it my childhood in my mind.\n[2009-09-01 10:04:00] Kristianvik room | I realized memory is not a reliable measure in a person’s life—not only because memory does not represent truth. I thought that what determines whether memories present events correctly or falsely is not truth itself, but the interests of memory. I found memory to be pragmatic, cunning, yet not in a hostile or malicious way; rather, I realized it does all this to please its owner—me, the one who remembers.\n[2009-09-01 10:04:10] Kristianvik room | I discovered some memories had been pushed into the void of forgetting, turning into a blank white expanse; some had been distorted beyond recognition; some were easily misleading; others were almost entirely blurred—while the few that remained were strikingly clear and precise. I realized I had no control over which memories would be preserved accurately.\n[2009-09-01 10:05:00] Kristianvik room | As far as I know, the years from 1968 to 1974 in my life form a vast, empty period. I realize that for me, memories from the first six years almost don't exist. I think I can hardly remember anything at all. I find that I don't know who took care of me, what I did, or who I played with—I feel as though all of it is completely blank.\n[2009-09-01 10:06:00] Kristianvik room | I think to myself: That's it. These are my first six years.\n[2009-09-01 10:06:10] Kristianvik room | I realize this is defined as a mysterious, significant memory, one that laid the foundation for my memories from ages seven or eight. I marvel inwardly: My earliest memory! At the same time, I discover there are other kinds of memories too. I think they aren’t fixed or eternal, not coming and going freely by will, but instead appearing intermittently within my self-awareness, floating and rising like transparent jellyfish. I feel they are awakened by a particular scent, a specific taste, a certain sound… I realize these smells, tastes, and sounds are always instantly recognizable to me, bringing a deep, inner joy.\n[2009-09-01 10:06:20] Kristianvik room | I see myself raising one hand to shield the sun, catching a ball midair, running across the grass holding a kite string, with my children close behind. I realize that when you're doing something you've done before, bodily memories come along with it. I feel those memories tied to emotions: sudden anger, sudden tears, sudden fear. I think I’m transported back, fully immersed—as if turning and flipping inside myself—and I feel age rushing backward at a frantic speed.\n[2009-09-01 10:06:30] Kristianvik room | I find then there are memories linked to landscapes. I sense that childhood scenery is different from the changed landscapes since then—it’s presented and stored in an entirely different way. I realize that every stone, every tree in that landscape carries meaning, not only because everything there was seen by me for the first time, but also because I’ve seen them many times since, letting them settle deep into consciousness. I think it’s not just rough, approximate, blurry—like scenery rising beyond a house, which adults must shut their eyes and strain to recall before it appears like a trick-revealed image—but terrifyingly precise, filled with details.\n[2009-09-01 10:07:00] Kristianvik room | In my mind, I feel that I only need to open the door and walk out—the flood of images would rush toward me like a tide.\n[2009-09-01 10:08:00] Kristianvik room | I realize everything about that sheepdog frightens me. I feel its growl, its yellow eyes, its tongue lolling from its mouth, its sharp fangs. I find that even now, my arm still bears its bite marks. I recall that after it happened, I told my family nothing. I realize I was afraid of being scolded—because I should have taken precautions to prevent such things: I shouldn’t have been there at that moment, or I shouldn’t have cried. I reflect: What’s so scary about a dog? I feel that from that day on, whenever I saw the sheepdog, fear would spread through my entire body.\n[2009-09-01 10:08:10] Kristianvik room | I realize this is critical, because I’ve not only heard that you must stand still when attacked by a dangerous wild animal, but also that dogs can smell fear. I don’t know who said it, but everyone believes it, and I know: If you’re afraid, a dog will smell it. I anticipate that the dog itself will then become fearful or provoked, and attack. I understand that if you’re not afraid, they’re gentle.\n[2009-09-01 10:08:20] Kristianvik room | So I begin to ponder this: How can dogs smell fear? What exactly is the fear they smell? I wonder—if a person pretends not to be afraid, won’t the dog notice the real feeling hidden beneath that pretense?\n[2009-09-01 10:09:00] Kristianvik room | I think to myself: That’s it. This is our world. But I marvel—what a realm it is!",

    "text": "[2009-09-01 10:10:00] Tibaken construction area | I know of a construction area with no roots connecting to the past, nor branches reaching into the future sky, like those satellite towns that once appeared. I understand it was a practical solution to a concrete problem—where all these temporary dwellers should live. I thought it would be here in this forest, and so I saw that land began to be sold regularly here.\n[2009-09-01 10:10:10] Bek's house | To my knowledge, the only house once standing in this forest belonged to a man named Bek, whose father came from Baywick and built this house by his own hands at the heart of the woods. I know they had no car, no washing machine or television. I see they had no garden, only a driveway paved on hard earth between the trees.\n[2009-09-01 10:11:00] Kristianvik room | I think about how what connects to the land—on the surface—are naturally roads, power lines, forests, and oceans, but what lies beneath the ground easily stirs unease within me. I ask myself: shouldn't the earth we stand on be absolutely indestructible and unshakable?\n[2009-09-01 10:12:00] Kristianvik room | I inwardly marvel that in our world, no one could be greater than these workers, and no work more meaningful than theirs.\n[2009-09-01 10:12:10] Kristianvik room | I realize I have no interest in the technical details, nor do I particularly care about how construction machinery is made. I think, for me, what draws the most attention—besides the changes these activities bring to the natural landscape—is their private lives.\n[2009-09-01 10:13:00] Kristianvik room | I sense how the water flows, how people walk? I exclaim inwardly: ah, it’s truly indescribable.\n[2009-09-01 10:13:10] Kristianvik room | I think, perhaps the place he has now reached is right by that bicycle Viktor Lunddal left on the sidewalk—I realize it’s about twenty meters away, just underground!\n[2009-09-01 10:13:20] Kristianvik room | I wonder, could these underground water access points be like some kind of station, where during a fire people can control the pipes and draw water up from there?\n[2009-09-01 10:14:00] Kristianvik room | I find that no one is strong enough to lift that incredibly heavy, coin-shaped sewer cover with their own strength, so I realize this question remains unanswered. I think, things kept this mysterious were numerous during that time.\n[2009-09-01 10:15:00] Kristianvik room | I ask myself: but actually, why not? Do they think we’d fall into the water?\n[2009-09-01 10:16:00] Kristianvik room | I saw myself start running toward the safe area, either into the open spaces in the woods or uphill toward the buildings, thinking that was a place where the fox would never dare appear. I saw a slight movement in the bushes, and I heard a rustling sound of something passing by. I realized that from then on I began to fear water sprites, but not as much as I feared the fox. I understood that just thinking about the fox filled me with overwhelming terror.\n[2009-09-01 10:17:00] Kristianvik room | I thought the worst thing must be darkness within the light. I said to myself, yes, if there's anything I truly fear, it's darkness in the midst of brightness.\n[2009-09-01 10:17:10] Kristianvik room | I realized what was most terrifying was that you could do nothing about it. I thought, calling for help wouldn't work, standing in the middle of an open space wouldn't help, and running would be useless too.\n[2009-09-01 10:18:00] Kristianvik room | I felt that dogs, foxes, and pipes were concrete, tangible threats. I thought that headless figures and grinning skeletons belonged to the realm of the dead—they didn’t reveal themselves in the same way. I realized they might be everywhere: in the cupboard I opened in the dark, on the stairs I was walking up, in the woods, yes, even under my bed or in the bathroom. I realized that for me, they had their own places—either they were there, or they weren’t.\n[2009-09-01 10:18:10] Kristianvik room | I looked at my reflection in the black glass window. I found myself associating the image in the glass with those creatures from another world, perhaps because they only appeared when darkness fell outside. I thought how chilling it was: this figure wasn’t me, but a ghost from another world, staring back at me.",
